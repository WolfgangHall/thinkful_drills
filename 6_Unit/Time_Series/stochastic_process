- a sequence of variables that have happened over a course of time
    - a process

- when variables are random, based of a distribution it is called a stochastic process


Bernoulli process
    - a set of independent and identically distributed random variables
        - each variable follows a bernoulli distribution

        -> independent
            - outcome of one variable does not affect the other
        -> identically distributed
            - each random variable comes from the same distribution

        - iid

        -> bernoulli
            - outcome only has two possible values
            - p and 1-p probabilities


Random Walks
    - the sum of iid random variables

    - if random dist is bernoulli -> simple random walk
        - if p is 0.5 -> symmetric simple random walk

    - Wiener Process or Brownian motion
        - the direction of the next position is normalyl distributed

        - standard normal dist has an expected value of 0
            - stationary process

            - if deviation from expected
                - drifts


- when tracking a single object, or entity over time
    - the observed values are a stochastic process

    - moves randomly in some direction over time
        - purchases by consumers
        - stock prices
