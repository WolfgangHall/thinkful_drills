Economic Models

Linear Regression
    - OLS
    - logistic
    - lasso
    - ridge

    - not most accurate form of predictive modeling
        - though things can be done to make it more accurate

    - popular due to explanatory power
        - understanding of why things are happening

    - often deal with aggregate data
        - unemployment rate
        - gdp

        - datasets can sometimes be too small for other techniques to be stable or reliable


Robust Regression
    - useful when you have outliers in your data that you want to prevent from dominating the model

    - outliers influence linear model coefficients because errors are so large
        - leads to volatility of coefficients -> undesirable

    - 3 different types in sklearn:

        1. Huber
            - works well when the outliers are in the response or outcome
            - uses a loss function on outliers
                - the further out they are, the less they influence the regression (though there is still influence)

        2. Thiel-Sen
            - works better with errors in the inputs
            - relies on medians
            - does not assume normally distributed error
                - makes outliers irrelevant (unless enough exist to shift median)

        3. RANSAC
            - RANdom SAmple Consensus
            - tends to work best if the outliers are large
            - iteratively works through several random samples of data to build linear regression models
                - searches for outliers (based on errors)


Probit and Tobit

    - Probit
        - models a probablistic outcome
        - used for the same kinds of problems as logistic regression
        - cuts off outcomes at 1 and 0 -> forced probablistic bounds

    - Tobit
        - positives only linear regression
        - coefficients are reinterpreted -> all negative outcomes are associated with 0
            - ensures that output is always valid
            - sometimes negative values arer illogical or impossible

    - Logit
        - logistic regression


STATA

    - more of a scripting language than a programming language
