Production Economics
    - economics of how things are made
    - what larger inputs combine to create goods and how changing those will impact the amount produced


Economic Production
    - fixed ratio of inputs
        - 10 wood and 3 steel == table

    - scaled ratio of inputs
        - salespeople and products and sales


Cobb-Douglas Production
    - gives the relationship between two inputs and their production

    - $$Y = AL^BK^a $$

    - Y -> the total output produced

    - A -> a factor of productivity
        -> scales the output appropriately

    - L -> input
        -> labor

    - K -> input
        -> capital

    - Beta -> output elasticity
    - Alpha -> output elasticity
        -> help quantify the effect of additional units of our inputs on the output


    - L and K feature diminishing marginal returns
        - meaning each additional unit produces decreased output

    - allows for varied forms of returns to scale
        - if sum of two exponents is less than 1 => decreased returns to scale
        - if exponents sum to 1 => constant returns to scale
        - more than 1 => increasing return to scale


    - can be used in conjunction with Linear Regression
        - through use of logs
        - log each side of the equation

        - $$log(Y) = c + B log(L) + a log(K)

        - transforming Y, L and K

        - coefficients returned estimate the values of beta and alpha


Uses

    - any kind of production
    - trying to model the production of a good from labor and raw materials
    - sales from marketing and inventory spend

    - problem must have limited, easily countable inputs

    - if the model fits well, you can know more about the relationship of production
        - can be used to grow production
