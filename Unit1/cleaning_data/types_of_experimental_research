3 basic types of experimental research designs
    1. pre-experimental designs
    2. true experimental designs
    3. quasi-experimental designs

true experiment designs are characterized by the random selection of participants and the random assignments of the participants to groups in the study

    - considered the best type of research design
    - effect on the dependent variable is directly due to manipulation of independent variable
