Methods for cleaning data

-> Replace with missing indicator
    - None in python
    - NULL in SQL

    - If the values are anomalies
        - incredibly high or low in comparison to the rest of the data

    - Fake answers
        - straightlining -> giving the same answer to every question
        - repeating pattern of answers
        - plot response times for indicator of correctness

-> Replace to a valid response

    - if the value is an anomaly
        - scale of 1 to 7 -> answer is 77
            - may be acceptable to change to 7

    - extreme but plausible values
        - 'winsorizing'
            - choose a percentile like 90%
            - all values below the 5th percentile are equal to the value at the 5th percentile
            - all values above the 95th percentile are equal to the value at the 95th percentile

-> Remove values
    - user submits a form twice
    - overlap of two data sources

Systemetic Cleaning
    - dirty patterns that are widespread/systematic
        - income survey -> low income respondents may skip this question
        - high income respondents will answer
            - skews data
