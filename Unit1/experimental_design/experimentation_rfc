experimentation RFC

    - rfc => 'request for comment'
    - research proposal
    - organized in 3 parts

    The Problem
        - define the question or problem
        - why should this question be answered
        - review what we know about the problem

    The Potential Solution
        - propose a hypothesis to be tested

    Method for Testing the Solution
        - describe the design of the experiment, the analysis plan, set benchmarks


    RFC helps to avoid common experimentation pitfalls
        - mis-match between question and study design
            - a question that proposes to measure something but doesn't actually measure that value

        - a design that does not generate usable data
            - comparing employee satisfaction, but each group uses different measures

        - False positives
            - moving benchmarks
            - stopping data collection early when things look promising, lack of real trends, reflects random chance
