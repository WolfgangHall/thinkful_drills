p-values
    - p stands for probability

    - p-value less than .05 is good, greater than .05 is bad

    - null hypothesis testing
        - the most common system used to test provisional beliefs about data

        - tester has hypothesis that describes what they think their data will look like if their expectations are confirmed

        - null hypothesis => describes what the data will look like if their expectations are not confirmed

        - data is then compared to the null hypothesis

        - t-test => the size of the difference between the two groups is divided by the combined variance of the groups
            - ratio is known as t-value
            - situtated within a t-distribution (like a normal distribution)
                - represents that t-values you get if the null hypothesis is true
                - the farther away the from the center the t-value is, the less likely it is that the null hypothesis is true
                - area under the curve is equal to 1
                - total area defined by the t-value adds up to the p-value

        - p-valie of < 0.05 means reject the null hypothesis
        - 0.05 is the threshold
            - in theory, returns a false positive for 1 in 20 tests
            - corresponds to two standard deviations or two sigma


T-Values
    - default t-test is 'two-tailed' accounting for negative values
    - if using a one tailed t-test, only sum the area under the curve of one of the tails
    - one-tailed test is appropriate when comparing an average weight to zero
        - the weight cannot be negative
    - two-tailed test is used as it is typically better to be too conservative (higher p-values than you should) than too liberal (lower p-values than we should)


Philosophy of Null Hypothesis Significance testing

    - p-value represents the probability of getting the data you have if the null hypothesis were true in the population

    - null hypothesis => typically a no-effect hypothesis

    - when p-value is less than .05 => there is less than 5% chance of getting your particular data by random chance, even though there was no effect in the population
        - rejection of null hypothesis

    - all NHST allows the data scientist to do is to conclude that there is probably not no effect


    - purpose of A/B test is to create a situation where there are only two possible outcomes
        - if your hypothesis is correct -> leads to outcome X
        - if the null hypothesis is correct -> does not lead to outcome X

    - very difficult to limit to just two outcomes
        - very hard to definitively say, the outcome is based on just one effect
        - can disprove a hypothesis, can never definitively prove a hypothesis correct
            - can add support by disproving others
