Bias

    - bias refers to anything that causes a sample to systematically differ from the population

    - can come from:
        - the sampling procedure
        - the assignment to conditions procedure
        - context of the study
        - the people running the study

    - sampling bias (selection bias)
        - when the sample differs from the population in some way (more women, younger, richer)
        - conclusions based on the sample do not apply to greater population
        - can be avoided with random selection

    - assignment to conditions
        - failure of randomness
        - sample should be separated into simlar groups
            - the only difference should be the variable introduced
            - if one group has a median age of 13 and the other 30, you can't make assertive statements

    - context of study
        - sometimes the setting plays a large role on the sample
            - hot, cold

    - bias from the people running the study
        - interviewer smiles when given an answer they like, frowns when the answer is not wanted
        - not recording answers that refute the hypothesis
        - observer bias


A/A testing
    - all but selection bias may be detectable using A/A testing
    - provides context for results of A/B testing

    - compares the outcome of choice between two identical versions of something

    A/A testing is useful for:
        - different testing methods: send the same email out in the morning when people are at work, send the email in the evening

        - random split method: send the email to long-term subs and short-term sub groups

        - outside factors
