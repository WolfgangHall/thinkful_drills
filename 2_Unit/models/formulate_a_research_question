statistical model
    - the mathematical expression of a research question

supervised learning
    - begin with an outcome of interest
    - a particular variable that you want to understand, explain or predict

    sample research question
        - (broad question) How do we best predict the outcome of interest given the data?
        - (narrow question) What is the most accurate estimate of the outcome of interest for N groups under X conditions?

    different types of research questions call for different types of models
        - questions about odds or likelihoods
            - use models that deal with binary outcomes
        - questions about quantity
            - use models that deal with continuous outcomes

Questions to ask as you go
    - what is already known about the topic?
        - no need to reinvent the wheel

    - what sort of data, or ways to collect data are available to me on this topic?
        - without relvant data, you're merely speculating

    - what skills do I have?
        - the question should be addressable using the statistical and programming skills you know, or you can learn in the time allotted

    - can this question be answered using quantities or probabilities?
        - if using a math model, must be amenable to a numeric solution

    - can the research question be asked in one sentence?
        - more refined questions are better than those that are too broad or vague
