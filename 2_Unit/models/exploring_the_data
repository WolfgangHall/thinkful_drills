Univariate Analysis

    after defining a research question -> learn about individual variables through inspection
        - inspect data file itself
        - create visualizations
        - univariate descriptive stats
            -> univariate pertains to one variable, rather than many

    questions to ask:
        - how many variables do I have?
        - how many datapoints?
        - which variables are continuous?
            -> have an infinite number of possible values -> like age
        - which variables are categorical?
            -> limited number of values -> gender
        - do any of my variables have a known probability distribution?
            -> normal, Poisson, Gamma
        - do I have missing data? how much?
        - how much variance is there in each of my variables?

        After cleaning the data, you should know the answer to most of these questions


Bivariate Analysis

    after univariate analysis look for pairwise relationships in your data


    => 2 continuous variables
        - scatterplot
            -> represents relationship between 2 continuous variables
            -> can create scatterplot matrixplot that shows all bivariate relationships in one plot with multiple subplots

            - correlation coefficient R
                - numeric representation of the linear relationship between two continuous variables
                - range from -1 to 0 to 1

            what to look for?
                - two-dimensional outliers that represent unusual combinations of values


    => 1 continuous variable, 1 categorical variable
        - boxplot, violin plot, similar plots estimate the value of the continuous variable for each variable of the categorical
            - provide descriptive stats, including estimates of central tendency and variance, for the continuous variable at each level of categorical variable
            - t-tests and ANOVA (analysis of variance)

            - what to look for?
                - Outliers in each group
                - very small groups


    => 2 categorical variables
        - barplot
            - the height of each bar indicates the number of datapoints in each combination of levels of the two variables
        - a table of counts
            - provides the number of datapoints for each combination of levels of the two variables
        - chi-square tests
            - test that indicate whether one combination of levels is signficantly smaller or larger than the rest

            -what to look for?
                - subgroups with very small counts relative to other subgroups


Interpreting pairwise plots and statistics

    - which of your variables are redundant?
    - which provide unique information?

    - are there unusual two-dimensional datapoints that could skew analysis?
        - outliers?
        - subgroups with very small variance relative to other subgroups?
        - subgroups with very small Ns? (sample sizes)



After looking through the data -> decide strategy for dealing with unusual two-dimensional datapoints
    - discarding data
    - winsorizing
    - collapsing small or similar groups into one larger category
