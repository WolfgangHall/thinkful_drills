first question to ask when building a model
    => what kind of model do I need to build?

    - work from the top down

2 main groups of supervised learning:

    1. classification
    2. regression

    - when building a supervised model there is always an outcome that we are interested in
        - the kind of variable determines the model



Classification
    - outcome is a categorical variable
    - only takes discrete values from a data set
        => {yes, no}
        => {heads, tails}
        => {high, medium, low}
        => {buy, rent, no purchase}
    - anything that can be discretely counted and labaled
        - categorical types
            - ordinal
            - interval
            - ratio

    classifier is typically one of two things:
        - assigns a category to a test observation
        - will assign a probability of each category
            -> if given outcomes are {yes, no}, will assign a probability measure like {0.2, 0.8}

    - the only outcomes that will be possible must be in the training set
        - if you have a value that is not in the training set set, there is no way for the model to predict it

        => if you are trying to predict a show someone would watch and a movie is not in the training set, no way to predict that particular movie


Regression
    - outcome is a continuous variable
    - can output a bounded or unbounded number line
        - implies a relationship between the variables
            - 3 > 2 > 1
    => variable that could work
        amount spent
            - ranges from 0 to ??
        temperature


Example
    - outcome of interest: number of cars owned {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
    - can use either regression or classification
        - classiffication
            - evalute likelihood for each value
            - each level will be treated discretely
            - relationship between each level is not predefined
        regression
            - find the most likely place along a continuous line
                - many not even be within the bounds of 0 and 5


* classifiers do not not generally provide average values
- out come will be a single value that is the most likely, not the average
