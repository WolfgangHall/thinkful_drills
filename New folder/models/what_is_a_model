statistical model
    - represent complex info in a simple way to serve a goal
    -> a simplified mathematical representation of the data scientist's best guess about the underlying processes that created the data

    simplified
        - prioritize information-dense features
        - elements that explain a large amount of variance in the outcome of interest
        - excluding data leads to a less perfect representation but it's easier to work with

    mathematical representation
        - statistical model is a math formula or series of formulas

    best guess
        - the model represents the best understanding of data at the time
        - best guess about the underlying processes that lead to the observed outcomes
        - model design is informed by
            - prior knowledge about the topic
            - visual inspection of the data
            - outcomes of fitting previous models to the data

    underlying processes
        - good models give insight into how the variable of interest came to have the values that it does
            - useful in predicting future outcomes
            - reasonable approximation of underlying process that created outcomes
                - when given new data, you can predict the outcome

    getting rid of non-essential aspects in a dataset, can provide great insights


Models and math
    - stats models are based on mathematical formula(s)
        - in theory, any set of relationships among variables that can be represented with math can be used as a model
    - choose from a set of models whose math properties are well understood
        - some work well with continuous data, others with categorical
        - some allow only two variables
            - t-test -> categorical predictor and continuous outcome
        - others allow as many as wanted
