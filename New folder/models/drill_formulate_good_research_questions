1. What is the 1994 rate of juvenile delinquency in the U.S.?
This seems like a good question because it can be answered numerically.

2. What can we do to reduce juvenile delinquency in the U.S.?
This seems like a bad question because it is very vague.
The solution for this question cannot be boiled down to a number in it's certain state.
Perhaps, you can single out a specific factor that you want to test for.

3. Does education play a role in reducing juvenile delinquents' return to crime?
This seems like a good question.
This is a more refined version of the previous question.

This feels like a bad question.
There is no attempt to understand underlying reasons for an outcome of interest.
It also seems like this data is very easily procured.

5. What factors lead consumers to choose AT&T over other service providers?
This is a good question.
The researcher is looking for the underlying reason that leads to the choosing of AT&T over other service providers.

Perhaps in conjunction with the previous question, this question holds more merit.

7. Why did the Challenger Shuttle explode?
This is a good question.
The researcher is looking for the relationship between an outcome and the variables that led to it.

8. Which genes are associated with increased risk of breast cancer?
This is a good question.
Once again, there is a clear attempt to find the relationship between two variables, contraction of breast cancer and a gene.

9. Is it better to read to children at night or in the morning?
This questions seems very vague.
We need to define a metric for 'better'. Is it comprehension or memorization?

10. How does Googleâ€™s search algorithm work?
Seems like a decent question. We are searching for the underlying concepts that lead to a variable outcome.
