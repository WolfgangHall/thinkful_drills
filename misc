PCA

assumes linear relationship

rotation axes are not dependent on each other

one major component is the first one


cos(theta) = hypotenuse
sin(theta) = hypotenuse

imagine straight line going through origin

if you want component of line of x -> l cos theta
if you want component of line of y -> l sin theta



Naive Bayes

probability of people watching a video

start with assumption of prior -> can assume anything -> can assume normal distribution

do computation on whatever you are observing

using a prior to compute something that is the opposite

multiplies each feature ->
