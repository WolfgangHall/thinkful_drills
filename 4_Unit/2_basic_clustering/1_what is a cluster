What is a cluster?

    - dealing with more than one variable at a time
        -> let an algorithm organize data points with similar characteristics into groups

    - hard clustering
        -> each data point is assigned to only one cluster

    - soft clustering
        -> each data point is assigned a degree of membership for every cluster

    - an algorithmic cluster is a set of data points that have been determined to be more similar to one another than to other data points
        - the way similarity is determined is what differentiates various clustering methods

    - useful for generating features for a model
    - useful for learning more about associations between data points


    Caveats:
        -> normalize data before clustering
            -> all variables have equal potential impact on algorithm

        -> just because an algorithm can find a certain number of clusters, that doesn't mean all clusters are meaningful

        - if number of clusters is too high,
            - leads to overfitting
            - splitting on trivial differences

        - if number of clusters is too low
            - no useful information is gained

        - can cluster hierarchically
            -> lower-level clusters are formed and then grouped into higher-level clusters
