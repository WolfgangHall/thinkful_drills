K means Clustering

    - unsupervised learning algorithm
    - attempts to group similar clusters together in your data

    Typical problems?
        - cluster similar documents
        - cluster customers based on features
        - market segmentation
        - identify similar physical groups

    - divide data into distinct groups such that the groups are similar

How it works?
    - choose a number of clusters, 'k'
    - randomly assign each point to a cluster
    - until clusters stop changing, repeat the following:
        -> for each cluster compute the cluster centroid by taking the mean vector of points in the cluster
        -> assign each data point to the cluster for which the centroid is the closest


There is no easy wat for choosing a 'best' K-value

    - compute th sum of squared error (SSE) for a couple of values

    ** SSE -> sum of the squared distance between each member of cluster and its centroid

    - plot k agaist SSE
        - error decreases as k gets larger

    - elbow method
        - choose k at which the SSE decreases abruptly
