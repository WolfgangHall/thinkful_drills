0,College Football Week 4 Preview: Mesquite-Fired Flavor in Every Snap,"How’s everybody recovering from the emotional exhaustion of last week? Feeling rested? Spite glands slowly refilling? This is about it for fan conditioning, the last chance you’ll have to get into game shape, spiritually speaking; Week 4 brings most of the FBS-on-FCS ultraviolence to a close. Prepare for a Saturday of frantic toggling between ranked Pac-12 action, stoking the eternal flames of SWC animosity, and reviewing radiation incident plans for your home in case whatever toxic compounds UCF and South Carolina form can be diffused by air. (All times Eastern.) Top 25 Matchups: Two, both out west. And, of course, they overlap. The following video will serve as a stand-in for the emotions of the viewing public in this matter:  No. 9 UCLA at no. 16 Arizona (8 p.m., ABC) kicks off first, with the Bruins down a third defensive starter for the year following the loss of Triangle All-Star and Internet darling Myles Jack. No. 18 Utah at no. 13 Oregon gets under way shortly after in Eugene (8:30 p.m., Fox), with both starting quarterbacks already in some state of disrepair. How High Are the Week 4 Stakes? About the height of a drop from ground level to the deep end of an emptied post-summer swimming pool. Full slates of conference play can’t get here soon enough. Destination Game of the Week: Southern at no. 7 Georgia (noon, SECN). The Jaguars were contracted by the Bulldogs to bring their Human Jukebox up from Louisiana, giving Georgia fans a reason to actually show up for a noon game against an FCS team, and your friendly neighborhood college football blogger an excuse to post videos of said band:  Crank the speakers up and keep scrolling. This is your soundtrack for the rest of this post. You are welcome.  ESS DUBYA CEE Rivalry Games of the Week: Four teams formerly seen playing under the greatest athletic logo this country has ever known cross paths in the Lone Star State this week. Texas Tech hosts no. 3 TCU (4:45 p.m., Fox) in a game that — unforgivably, if you ask me — no longer awards a saddle to the winning squad. In Arlington, Razorbacks alum Jerry Jones welcomes no. 14 Texas A&M and Arkansas (7 p.m., ESPN) to his personal football cathedral for a game in which, verbal niceties aside, you’ll see two teams try to run up the score harder than any other this season, guaran-damn-teed. Grudge Matches of the Week: It’s been a rough few days in the Yellowhammer State, with both premier football programs suffering divisional defeats, but there’s hope on the horizon in Tuscaloosa as no. 12 Alabama welcomes Louisiana-Monroe (4 p.m., SECN). The Warhawks and Crimson Tide are tied 1-1 all-time, and if Bama’s bunch is able to take the series lead here, it’s safe to say it’ll go a long way toward salving the wounds of September.1 If ULM triumphs again, well, we’ll hear about it in the skies, sure as not.  Highest Potential Drinking Buddy Bliss Games of the Week [TIE]: Two criminally underrated tailgating fan bases meet out in Greenville, with Virginia Tech traveling to East Carolina (3:30 p.m., ABC/ESPN2). Later, in prime time, Hawaii makes its second trip to the Big Ten this season, this time to no. 22 Wisconsin (8 p.m., BTN). Support Cruelty-Free Football and Ban These Games: After much lobbying of legislators on both the state and national level, it doesn’t appear that human rights groups will be able to prevent Tennessee at Florida (3:30 p.m., CBS) from being inflicted on both the participants and the viewing public. If there’s any comfort to be had, it’s that it’s impossible to imagine a more aesthetically displeasing football contest than these squads staged last season. But we can do something about these nonconference atrocities. Get involved. Write and call your congresspeople, and tell them that outrages like Kansas at Rutgers (noon, BTN) and UCF at South Carolina (noon, ESPNU) simply will not be abided. This Week in Why? NC State at South Alabama (8 p.m., ESPNEWS). You sure you wanna play the only FBS team in the state of Alabama coming off a Week 3 win, Wolfpack? This Week in Why Not? No. 8 LSU at Syracuse (noon, ESPN), because every college town should experience the cuddly, beer-draining terror of a Bayou Bengals visit. The great thing about a lot of teams still playing no-account tuneup games is you don’t have to watch them! Spend long stretches of time instead with the contests that might actually get interesting. (Sincere apologies in advance to whoever this jinxes into losing to a team it paid half a million dollars to play.) Thursday: One game on offer, Cincinnati at Memphis (7:30 p.m., ESPN). Friday: Boise State at Virginia leads off your weekend (8 p.m., ESPN), followed by no. 21 Stanford at Oregon State (10 p.m., FS1). Saturday: Ever been pouring something carbonated into a glass, and it starts to foam over the rim, but you just keep right on pouring even though you’re making a sticky mess you will promptly forget to clean up? In the spirit of that pugnacious American optimism, try alternating between Kansas at Rutgers (noon, BTN) and UCF at South Carolina (noon, ESPNU) to start the day, just to see what happens to your blood chemistry. Mix in a little Southern at no. 7 Georgia (noon, SECN) for Human Jukebox relief. In the afternoon slate, it’s all in one state. No. 24 Oklahoma State at Texas (3:30 p.m., ESPN) provides what’s probably your first look at the Cowboys this season; there’s something about playing Central Michigan, Central Arkansas, and UTSA that keeps a team below the national radar. Change over to no. 3 TCU at Texas Tech at 4:45 p.m. (Fox), and follow that up with no. 14 Texas A&M vs. Arkansas (7 p.m., ESPN). For prime-time consumption, your server recommends no. 9 UCLA at no. 16 Arizona (8 p.m., ABC), to be ingested alongside no. 18 Utah at no. 13 Oregon (8:30 p.m., FOX). Stay in the Pac-12 for the nightcap game of no. 19 USC at Arizona State (10:30 p.m., ESPN). Until then, run some shuttles to keep your conditioning up.

1,"College Football Week 8 Wrap: A Giddy, Glorious Highlight Reel","It’s one thing to have written this warning, on Thursday, secure in the belief that it was entirely correct: “If this season has taught you anything, it should be that the moment you begin to turn your head on a game is exactly when weird shit’s going to start to happen just out of your field of vision.” It’s quite another to gaze back at the still-smoldering embers of Week 8 and contemplate the distance between last week and now. Heading into the back half of the 2015 regular season, the last perfect Pac-12 team has fallen. The SEC’s calamitous derby has Florida/Georgia and LSU/Alabama back out in front, same as it ever was. Iowa remains undefeated, and the next-best teams in the Big Ten West are 6-2. Three perfect teams top the Big 12 standings, and the best-looking one among them has just suffered a nasty injury blow. There’s another three-way tie in the ACC, with a trio of one-loss teams gunning for the Coastal crown. And the American contains three squads that could make a run at an at-large playoff bid — or snuff one another out along the way. And just look at the staggering volume of all you might have missed, had you bailed on what looked like a sleepy schedule! Two quadruple-overtime games! Two lost coaches, one of whom retires with hair the precise color of his coaching polo, the other unceremoniously ousted after the kiss of professional doom, the Dreaded Vote of Confidence from his AD! And two kick-sixes! First, there was the one you likely already heard about, the one that snapped no. 9 Florida State’s streak of 28 conference victories. That the team doing the snapping was 2-5 Georgia Tech made the surprise sting all the more: That’s a 56-yard field goal attempt by FSU’s Roberto Aguayo, returned for a touchdown by GT’s Lance Austin, whose twin, Lawrence Austin, was with him in the end zone.

We can do that, too:  But the Noles don’t shoulder this shame exclusively, not this week. They had company down in the Yellowhammer State, which produces more than its share of kick-six misery and this week bestowed its dubious blessing upon South Alabama. If the Jackets’ score leads our top-10 You Had To Be There Week 8 highlights, call this one 1A: The rest of our arbitrary but lovingly selected top 10 follows: 2. Pretty much everything Stanford does when it has the ball. Between sophomore Christian McCaffrey’s third 300-total-yard game of the season and this formation, the Cardinal’s steadfast dedication to giving fans and opponents all they can handle, by both volume and weight, is commendable. 2 TE, 7 LINEMEN. STANFORD IS TURNT pic.twitter.com/M3yoS6g7PJ — Brian Floyd (@BrianMFloyd) October 25, 2015  3. Laquon Treadwell making SportsCenter for the right reasons. Nearly a year ago, the Ole Miss receiver was dealt a crazily cruel end to his season, breaking his fibula against Auburn while fumbling the football just before the goal line. Now, he’s doing things like this:  Much better. 4. Ohio State’s latest quarterback-combo move. J.T. Barrett is reinstalled as the Buckeyes’ starter, and five touchdowns against Rutgers later, that seems to be working out well for Ohio State. Meanwhile, that’s Braxton Miller performing the kind of on-field acrobatics not seen since, um, his own Week 1 game. 5. The collected works of USC’s assorted Smiths. The Trojans’ 42-24 victory over no. 3 Utah (just like we drew it up, right?) featured three interceptions from freshman linebacker Cameron Smith, including a 54-yard pick-six, and this hellacious, deliciously disrespectful stiff-arm from sophomore receiver Juju Smith-Schuster: Did he just point at him to come get that work or am I tripping ? https://t.co/1Z5v1KqCZd — Robbie Robinson (@RobinsonEra_) October 25, 2015  You can read some more on the background of what all went into that utter torching, or you can just watch the video loop until the sun darkens its rays in deference to Juju. Follow your hearts and your spite glands. 6. Louisville’s underappreciated Fat Guy Touchdown.  Not here to tell anybody else how to do his job, but these announcers don’t sound all that excited to see defensive end Sheldon Rankins, listed by Louisville at 6-foot-2 and 303 pounds, running 46 yards for a score and doing a damn on-field hurdle in the process. Perk up, y’all! 7. Clemson’s third-string QB scoring two more touchdowns than Miami’s entire team. When examining a 58-0 obliteration for highlight moments,1 the choices are bound to be overwhelming, but amid the accolades for Deshaun Watson and the Tigers defense, save some love for freshman quarterback Kelly Bryant, who hung 14 on the Hurricanes in the game’s final period, including this 59-yard scoring run: 8. War Eagle, valorous in defeat. The four overtime periods that Arkansas and Auburn went through contained enough action for an entire additional game, and the teams wouldn’t have gotten there in the first place without this monstrous snag from Ricardo Louis: 9. Pat Narduzzi and Jim Chaney’s shared sense of sadism. There is occasional beauty to be found in cruelty, if you know just where to look and can do so without flinching: BREAKING A TEAM'S WILL: A ONE DRIVE PLAY.

2,Are the Golden Bears About to Break Through?,"Stefan McClure was having an unusual Saturday. The California senior safety had scooped up a Washington State fumble during a failed Cougars fake punt attempt and was racing for the end zone, but he couldn’t seem to hear anything happening around him. The assembled audience in Memorial Stadium, the hollers from his teammates, his own feet thudding into the turf, none of it seemed to be actually happening until the ground beneath his cleats changed from green to blue. It was his first career touchdown, Cal’s first fumble returned for a score since 2011 — and though McClure didn’t know it at the time, he had just lit the fuse on a 21-point third quarter that would power his team past Wazzu for an eventual 34-28 victory. That win moved the Golden Bears to 5-0, making them one of just two undefeated teams in the Pac-12. But none of that registered. McClure knows, with a better sense of immediacy than most players his age, that any play could be his last. Injured for varying spans of every season he’s been in Berkeley, sidelined for 2012 and more than half of 2013, the awareness that his final season of college ball could be taken away from him without warning fuels his every step. “You get down,” he says, “those first couple weeks when you’re stuck on crutches and can’t do anything. Every chance that I get to play, I’m just thankful, and I’m going to leave it all out there.” The process of expelling every particle of energy from his body against the Cougars offense leaves no available bandwidth for sense memory. “Really, in that moment,” McClure said on Sunday after practice, “it’s blank. You’re just running, and then you look back, and” — here he mimes a double take — “wait, that’s a touchdown!” That same sense of surreality accompanied McClure’s first career sack, less than 10 minutes of game time after his score. “All I could think was, ‘Oh man, oh man, I hope he doesn’t see me, I hope he doesn’t see me.’” His third-down takedown of Luke Falk forced the Cougars into a field goal attempt, which flew wide right, a distinct reprieve on a day with slim limits for error. McClure, responsible for two of a handful of plays that gave Cal a six-point victory, its third consecutive win decided by less than a touchdown, was awarded Pac-12 honors for Defensive Player of the Week. A Golden Bear earning league defensive distinctions is something of a curiosity on its own,1 and a more than welcome development in Berkeley, where for a while now the program has been attempting to break the “how much offense can we put up before we need no defense whatsoever” barrier with limited success. Head coach Sonny Dykes, the noted pointsplosion enthusiast imported to replace Jeff Tedford in December 2012, fielded a 2013 squad that ranked 119th out of 125 FBS teams in yards allowed per play. Dykes brought in longtime Tommy Tuberville cohort Art Kaufman as DC before the 2014 season; that unit, severely constrained by injuries and inexperience, edged up to reach 107th out of 128 teams. To clamber out of a well of that depth is a mighty task for any program. For a squad running an Air Raid system at anything approaching its desired tempo, defensive personnel management gets even trickier, owing to an increased volumetric need for capable bodies to perform opposite an offense that never gives it much breathing time on the sideline. “We’re playing two deep at linebacker, three deep in the defensive line, and we’re not quite there in the secondary,” Kaufman says. “Hopefully, we’ll get to where we can play five corners in a game, five safeties in a game, two nickels, and maybe a third guy. That’s our focus, because a tired player’s no good.” A year ago, shortly after his inaugural game with the Bears, Kaufman gathered the 25 defenders who’d been on the field for the team’s season opener at Northwestern. “I said, ‘If you started in the game at a position you’ve played at before, stand up.’ And there was one guy that stood up. I said, ‘If you have not played at this level on defense in at least a year, or never, stand up,’ and I had 15 guys standing.” This season, he credits progress in technique and execution in part to Cal’s strength program, but mostly to muscle memory. “They don’t have to focus on what to do anymore. They can now focus on how to do it.” Through five games, the Bears defense is allowing about 5.5 yards per play, down from 2014’s average of 6.27 and 2013’s 7.08, which places them somewhere in the middle of the national pack.2 Sacks and tackles for loss are both way up. The plus-eight turnover margin is a credit to all involved. Keep in mind that all of these numbers were put up against one FCS team, one Mountain West team, flailing Texas, and the two Washington Pac-12 outfits. Sturdier competition is on the way, and fast. But things are happening. When Dykes says, not excusing the side of the ball he’s less interested in, but plainly stating a fact, “I don’t need to have the best defense in college football,” he’s right for two reasons. The first is that after last year’s abysmal showing, any flicker of life on defense constitutes progress. The second is that this is a Sonny Dykes team, and that comes with the Sonny Dykes–and–Tony Franklin offense, and it’s Year 3 of their tenure in Berkeley. And that means it’s time to start watching the sky for explosions. ??? Jason O. Watson/Getty Images Stefan McClure takes down quarterback Luke Falk of the Washington State Cougars. “I’ve created a monster,” says Bears offensive coordinator Tony Franklin, grinning with the air of a mad scientist giving a laboratory tour. A Dykes collaborator since 2010, Franklin has never before had the same quarterback to work on for three consecutive years in this system. In junior Jared Goff, he’s found natural talent and supernatural composure, neither of which seems to have tapered off since Goff became the first true freshman quarterback to start a season opener for Cal in 2013. “You knew you had something by his talent in that first spring,” Franklin says. “Watching him compete for the starting job, he wasn’t afraid. And then in that opening game, he had two tipped pick-sixes. Not his fault. He didn’t blink. During the season, he had bad performances. He had times when I benched him. And I mean, he did not blink.” Two years later, in rare practice moments when he’s not actively throwing, Goff can be seen stalking around the turf observing the action with his arms behind his back, in unconscious imitation of his instructors. Franklin swears Goff is taller than he was as a sophomore. He’s developed a coachly midrange stare of vague self-dissatisfaction that he deploys in a press conference following a game with a margin of victory that is not to his liking, after a performance consisting of completions on 33 of 45 passes for 390 yards, one interception, and four touchdowns that Dykes will later characterize as “benign.”3 And he’s in such total command of everything, Goff has been granted the freedom to alter play calls on the field. This is familiar territory for Dykes, who went particularly loose on the reins with Graham Harrell during his time coordinating for Mike Leach at Texas Tech, but for Franklin it’s a first, and the adjustment process has been harrowing, like the parent of a student driver mashing a phantom brake pedal from the passenger seat.4 “I’ve never let anybody do that. Ever. It’s been hard for me to give up,” Franklin says. “I never want him to feel that he has the pressure to be right; I want it to be my mistake.” Through more than 40 percent of their regular season, the Bears’ experiment with an off-leash Goff is showing promise: He’s completing more than 70 percent of his throws and has thrown four interceptions — only one of which Dykes can chalk up to a poor decision — and 15 touchdowns. Eight of those have been caught by Kenny Lawler, who appears to have that kind of alchemical mind-meld with Goff that springs from countless hours of summer reps. Up since the middle of Friday night with a stomach virus and vomiting throughout the game, Lawler still hauled in six passes Saturday for 105 yards and two scores, including this beauty:  “It’s comforting for all of us,” Dykes says. “When you put the ball in your quarterback’s hands as many times as we do, and you trust him, it certainly makes it easier to sleep at night.” “He’s playing at a level right now that few people will play at,” Franklin says. “He sits in the pocket — bam! — takes it in the mouth, and turns around and throws a bullet for a touchdown. Time after time after time. It’s really fun to watch.” ??? Being fun to watch is nice and all, but it doesn’t necessarily fill the win-loss column. Cal hasn’t started a season 5-0 since 2007, but it’s easy to forget now that this time last year, the Bears were 4-1. It’s easy to forget, because after a 49-45 loss at Arizona, a 59-56 double-overtime win over Colorado, and a 60-59 win at Washington State in consecutive weeks, the team had nothing left in the tank. “We played 330 snaps in a three-game stretch,” Kaufman says. The Bears lost their next three games — all at home, to Washington, UCLA, and Oregon5 — went up to Corvallis and beat a listless Oregon State, then dropped their final three regular-season contests to USC, Stanford, and BYU to finish 5-7. “I mean, we were dead,” Franklin says. “We were just done.” Fast-forward five games into 2015, and here’s what Cal is staring down: a night game on the road this Saturday against undefeated no. 5 Utah, with the Utes coming off a bye week that’s afforded them plenty of time to bask in their 62-20 obliteration of Oregon. After a week off for themselves, the Bears have a Thursday-night game in hostile territory, this one against no. 20 UCLA. That’s followed by no. 17 USC at home on Halloween, and a visit to Eugene and the Ducks to kick off November. Questions are about to be raised on the field that demand answers. Will the ground game pick back up after a few weeks’ letdown and a pair of critical face-plants6 against Wazzu? Will Kaufman’s unit be able to hold its own against a sustained barrage of Pac-12 offenses? What kind of cohesion will the team display once the body-blow games start raining punches? Ready or not, the time for Cal to transition from “consistently good television” to “consistently good football team” is now. In the macro view, there are advantages to making this run in this year, with the Bears’ race to relevance taking place against the backdrop of a Pac-12 that’s deeply talented and just as deeply tumultuous, with individual program destinies feeling less and less determinate with every passing week. In the micro, there’s Dykes’s very real concern that with what could be the season’s biggest game just days away, he hasn’t seen a complete performance out of his team yet. “We haven’t played as well yet as we’re capable of playing,” Dykes says. “We haven’t been able to put together four quarters of really good football. I don’t even know if we’ve been able to put together three yet. We know we can get it out of ’em; we’ve got to just do it.” The Pac-12 is more than ready to make sure teams that fall behind get left behind. But let’s not let this moment pass without noting how remarkable it is that this school is even in the realm of realistic discussion of programs keeping pace, how this squad is two years removed from a 1-11 campaign in which it lost to every FBS team it played, and has equaled last season’s win total by the first week of October. This is California’s moment before the moment, and that can be scary, but there’s a grim egalitarianism to what it’s about to attempt. The Bears, after all, are afforded the same choice as anyone about to step into an abyss: Either you can fall, or you can fly.",2015-10-07T12:26:35+00:00,College Football,Anderson
3,"The Scarlet Program: Disarray, Dysfunction, and Dismal Pride at Rutgers","Kevin, Matt, and Mark came to Rutgers to see a show. Not one of them has the slightest rooting interest in the Scarlet Knights, or in the visiting Kansas Jayhawks. The trio are Big Ten adherents, alumni of Maryland, Wisconsin, and Michigan, respectively — but it wasn’t conference loyalty luring them to Piscataway, New Jersey. No, this was a rubbernecking excursion, and these guys were here to warm their hands by the biggest tire fire college football had on offer in Week 4. This was a fair expectation on their part. Rutgers, which played its first football game in 1869, and which very much enjoys reminding anyone who will listen that its school is the Birthplace of College Football, is currently experiencing several decades’ worth of crisis all at once. Things started to go sideways with the dismissal of six players, five prior to the season opener and another days later, following arrests on robbery and assault charges in connection with a series of home invasions. Then there was the standout receiver, Leonte Carroo, suspended after being collared for simple assault in a domestic violence case a week later. Shortly before kickoff Saturday, a release circulated saying RU’s star defensive tackle, Darius Hamilton, a senior captain who won last season’s team defensive MVP award and earned all-conference honors, would miss the rest of the season due to injury. And there is, of course, the small matter of Rutgers’ head coach, Kyle Flood, who is serving a suspension of his own, one following a lengthy investigation that revealed his bewilderingly ill-conceived and flagrant attempts to circumvent university policy in order to maintain academic eligibility for a struggling player, a student who would turn out later to be among those initial half-dozen kicked off the team anyway. Throw in Kansas as an opponent, a team that opened the season by losing to FCS powerhouse South Dakota State and got subsequently trounced by Memphis. Then compound that with the fact that Rutgers was coming off a 28-3 thrashing at Penn State and a Week 2 loss to Washington State,1 and the lure of this particular contest for unaffiliated gawkers becomes, if not advisable, at least understandable. “I was looking for pants-on-head silliness,” Kevin said afterward, “and a complete lack of footballing competence.” Alas, even as the sporting event equivalent of a Roger Corman movie, Rutgers-Kansas disappointed — not well played by any stretch of the imagination, but not remotely disastrous enough to fuel an entire afternoon of Bronx cheering. It also happened to just be a surpassingly beautiful day for football, once the clouds burned away after about a quarter of the game, and it was homecoming weekend, filling the surrounding grounds with even more pageantry and meat smoke than usual. The Knights rushed for over 300 yards and won 27-14. The Jayhawks could at least console themselves with having lost to a Power 5 team this time, and with a respectable-looking score. “That was entirely more satisfactory than I anticipated,” said Matt after the game, “which is to say I was entirely disappointed.” ??? The good news for Rutgers, if you’ve got a scorecard going at home, is that the Knights sent their haters home dissatisfied. The bad news is that real disaster could be just over the horizon. The team has a 2-2 record at the end of September, with wins over FCS program Norfolk State and Kansas, maybe the worst team in the Power 5, one conference loss already to Penn State, and another to a Wazzu team that seems destined to set up a really nice basement apartment in the Pac-12 North. The worse news is that conference play’s about to begin in earnest, and that RU’s next five opponents are no. 2 Michigan State, 4-0 Indiana, no. 1 Ohio State, no. 19 Wisconsin, and no. 22 Michigan. Right now, if there’s solace to be found in their immediate future, it’s that they get the Spartans and Buckeyes at home, and that after the Michigan State contest, they get back the coach who’s not only dumb enough to put evidence of his attempts to influence an instructor to change a player’s grade in writing, he’s dumb enough to use his non-university email account for it, hoping to avoid scrutiny, and then point out that that’s exactly what he’s doing. At the rough midpoint of Flood’s suspension, his university-administered sentence itself still makes no sense. Whether administrators are truly this invested in Flood’s body of work or just hoping for this whole affair to be ignored by the time his suspension lifts is unclear. But the Big Ten schedule the team has been assigned will make scandal-obfuscating victories very difficult to come by, and failure to hit .500 in the win-loss column would mean Rutgers finishing outside of the postseason for just the second time in the past decade. Indeed, it’s difficult to imagine any number of victories for any team that could obscure wrongdoing of this magnitude. At best, this situation is only going to metastasize from here. Think about it for a second: What would triumph on the football field even look like in December? Making a bowl after this tumultuous first month of the season could be spun into a turnaround narrative for the school if there were an interim coach at the head of the team, but can you imagine watching Flood, in a postseason press conference, talk about all the “adversity” he went through this year, and knowing what he means by that? Rich Schultz /Getty Images Suspended Rutgers coach Kyle Flood. And where the events of late summer and early autumn will be least forgotten is where they should matter the most — within the university community itself. It’s one thing to frustrate paying audience members who show solely to giggle at a catastrophe, but what of the team’s actual fans? Even dedicated Knights followers and full-throated supporters of Flood were appalled when the report was released and the subsequent punishments were announced; after a full Saturday of wandering the grounds around the stadium, the most glowing endorsements of the head coach I could find could be characterized as “aggrieved bemusement.” One longtime fan, Scott, is a New Jersey native who attended a D-III university but follows the Knights; he’s had season tickets for the better part of a decade now. The current cascade of indignities hasn’t lessened his desire to show up on Saturdays, but that patience comes with something of an expiration date. “I just figure at the end of this year they will clean house and start over,” he said Sunday. “If they don’t, then my stance will probably change.” Priya, a 2009 RU graduate in her third year as a season-ticket holder, takes a more coldly pragmatic view of Flood’s tenure. “It’s the abject stupidity that he displayed in going about it that really irks me,” she said. “And that alone is enough for me to want him gone.” ??? Not only did there appear to be more than enough in the report to cut Flood loose for cause — who could’ve credibly pushed back at his dismissal? — there also appears to be plenty of available cover from the fallout, thanks to recent events in conference realignment. To level up into top-tier competition like this requires an adjustment in win-loss expectations in the best of situations. With this brutal a conference schedule, bowl eligibility was already no sure thing for Rutgers, so it’s not like anticipation within the surrounding community would take some huge hit with the Knights playing out the season under an interim skipper. Wouldn’t it make so much more sense to bundle the difficulty externally inflicted by the league change with that internally inflicted by Flood, ride them both out together, and see how many fans might be willing to meet the team halfway? Because that’s the other anecdotal commonality found in Piscataway on Saturday: Every fan I could find, without exception, was stoked to be cheering for a team in the Big Ten. “Losing to Ohio State and the like isn’t going to be fun,” said Scott, “but like any fan, I am trying to convince myself that they will grow and be competitive.” “It’s been a huge plus,” said Priya of the move. “I’ll be stunned if anyone answers this differently. After all, it’s way easier to get pumped for a home game against Michigan than one against UConn.” There’s little football coaches love more than hollering about capital-C Character, something Flood won’t ever be able to convincingly attempt again. It’s an utter mystery who, exactly, is being served by hanging on to Flood, apart from Flood himself. It’s not the fans, who pay with their ticket dollars. It’s not the players, who pay with their time and with their health, and will have had a quarter of their guaranteed game days disrupted by the time the season’s over. It’s certainly not Flood’s assistants, who have to keep recruiting prospects into this situation with straight faces, against both the actual truth of the matter and whatever exaggerations are being concocted by their rivals. And it’s most definitely not the faculty and teaching staff of Rutgers, whose jobs are hard and insecure enough without worrying about explicit or implicit threats from the athletic department. All of these parties deserve a head coach who will advocate for them without willful disregard for entirely basic university boundaries. Rutgers as an institution isn’t out of time to start controlling what it can control, and counting on what’s already working in its favor to see it through two transitions at once. The Scarlet Knights will still have the weight of close to a century and a half of history behind them. They’ll still be a Big Ten team when they navigate out of this, in whatever fashion they do. Only they’ll have players, teachers, and fans who can don their colors on Saturdays secure in the knowledge that their university has acted in a manner consistent with a school that deserves to be in the Big Ten in the first place.",2015-09-30T10:36:04+00:00,College Football,Anderson
4,What to Watch: A Guide to College Football’s Opening Weekend,"Brothers and sisters, we made it. We’re out of the wilderness. We’re through the weeds. We’re running through tall grass with the blessed season in sight — and the sweetest reward of autumn is upon us, in the form of Florida International at UCF and North Carolina versus South Carolina, both kicking off at 6 p.m. on a Thursday night … Wait. WAIT. Come back! It’s still football! Sort of! It’s a football-like substance! Right, so, Week 1: never a time for the most heartstring-rending slate of games. Major programs are carrying out low-impact workouts against FCS schools. Big-name teams are facing off in the soulless confines of NFL stadiums hundreds of miles from either campus. Two Power 5 outfits are, this very week, traveling to games against directional Michigans. But just as Florida State hosts Texas State in the hopes of spotting any glaring game-plan flaws while in a low-stakes environment, so must you, the viewer, get in some warmup reps to avoid injury down the line. The season is a pot of still water, and you’ve got to turn the heat up slowly to really boil yourself alive in it.  All times Eastern. Top 25 Matchups: One. Adult humans in charge of no. 20 Wisconsin and no. 3 Alabama, two teams with fantastic game-day atmospheres back home and mighty, passionate fan bases, have decided to spend a weekend in the Dallas area in September, on purpose. They’ll meet in the Jerrydome, site of the 2014 national championship game, a 2015 playoff semifinal game, and precious little in between. Maybe that’s it. Maybe this is like a football mission trip, the Tide and Badgers bringing the good word to the downtrodden folk of Arlington. That’s sweet of them.

How High Are the Week 1 Stakes? The height of pole bean vines turning brittle and keeling over on the trellis. The heat of grilled cheese you made and then left sitting on the counter for 10 minutes because you decided you also wanted tomato soup. The potency of a Styrofoam cup of Cheerwine left in the car during an afternoon at the driving range. Destination Game: As long as the season continues to kick off over Labor Day weekend, there’s only ever going to be one best practice, which is to drop everything you’re doing and get to Atlanta for the people-watching event of the year. The annual neutral-site contest in the Georgia Dome brings in Louisville and no. 6 Auburn this season, pitting two of the sport’s most highly regarded offensive minds, Bobby Petrino and Gus Malzahn, against the last two defensive coordinators you’d want to bare-knuckle box, Todd Grantham and Will Muschamp. This game promises great fun in itself, but it’s the combination of ACC-SEC football and everything else happening in Atlanta at the same time that really gets the alchemy working: Dragon Con, Atlanta Black Pride Weekend, whatever happens to be going on at the Speedway (this week: Volkswagen show!), a 10K road race on Labor Day, and usually a Braves game or three thrown in (though mercifully, for everyone’s traffic-related cardiac events, there’s no home baseball this year). When you can walk into any centrally located bar and take a seat between a girl wearing fuzzy tiger ears and a tail arguing pass interference calls with a dude in a painstakingly reproduced Boba Fett outfit, you have to seize that opportunity. Grape Job, Scheduling Edition: One brightly colored “YOU TRIED, PROBABLY” sticker to whoever had the bright idea to bring Georgia Southern to West Virginia (7:30 p.m. Saturday, Fox Sports Go). This could be a very interesting game for unaffiliated viewers, but “interesting” isn’t typically a priority for athletic departments when plotting out their opening-week schedules. Group of 5 teams brought in for visits are expected to lose in spectacular fashion and are paid handsomely for their trouble, and GSU ain’t in the business of losing easily. The Eagles are well-liked around here for their habit of terrorizing bigger programs. They’re also down one starting quarterback for this game and coming into Morgantown at night, so we’ll see, won’t we? Grudge-ish Matches of the Week [TIE]: In a slate low on actual rivalry games that don’t involve in-state FCS teams getting fat checks to lose by 40 points to flagship universities, personnel moves supply the beef: Eastern Washington at no. 7 Oregon (8 p.m. Saturday, P12N) sends current Ducks starting quarterback Vernon Adams’s old team into Autzen, while Regular Washington, current home of Chris Petersen, travels to no. 23 Boise State, former home of Chris Petersen (10:15 p.m. Friday, ESPN). This Week in Why? On one hand, there are plenty of folks who’d like FBS teams to stick within the FBS for their nonconference games, and for those games to be played on the campuses themselves, where the deep, wacky regionalities of college football can be most keenly felt. On the other hand, who exactly went clamoring for Oklahoma State at Central Michigan (7 p.m. Thursday, ESPNU)? The answer has to involve T. Boone Pickens and fracking, surely. This Week in Why Not? No. 5 Michigan State at Western Michigan (7 p.m. Friday, ESPNU). This one at least keeps the money in the state economy, and it provides ample opportunity to imagine what it would be like stuck in the backseat between P.J. Fleck and Mark Dantonio on a cross-country road trip. Looming Upset-That-Is-Not: South Dakota State at Kansas (noon Saturday, Fox Sports Go). When North Dakota State beat Kansas State on opening weekend in 2013, that was a surprise. If Regular Kansas can stave off the advances of SDSU, which made it to the second round of last season’s FCS playoffs? That’ll be the upset. FCS-on-FBS Game Actually Worth Watching: Youngstown State at Pitt (1 p.m Saturday, ESPN3), if only for the press conferences and on-field postgame interactions between Bo Pelini and Pat Narduzzi. Youngstown native Pelini’s hot-mic mouth is familiar, but first-time head coach Narduzzi is already proving to be the sound-bite sleeper hit of the season: Pat Narduzzi w/ quite the first impression on the ACC teleconference, sharing a Scott Shafer tale from their URI days pic.twitter.com/Wt28m9GxeE — Matt Fortuna (@Matt_Fortuna) September 2, 2015  Thursday: Don’t rush home from work. Bank those early exits for later in the season, and give yourself until Michigan at Utah kicks off (8:30 p.m., FS1) to settle in. Once no. 2 TCU at Minnesota gets going (9 p.m., ESPN), alternate channels as needed. For a little extra kick, check in on UTSA at no. 22 Arizona (10 p.m., P12N) every now and then; the Roadrunners played the Wildcats within a field goal last year. True sickos or those with a four-day weekend already booked can stay up for a Colorado at Hawaii game that’s late even by Warriors standards (1 a.m., CBSSN), but don’t sacrifice too much sleep here; you’ll be up late the next three nights running. Friday: There’s a once-and-maybe-future rivalry game lurking here with No. 4 Baylor at SMU (7 p.m., ESPN). These former SWC foes have one additional meeting booked after this year, but if Chad Morris can execute a turnaround job on the Mustangs, more would be welcome. Camp out here for the duration, then stick around to watch Washington at no. 23 Boise State (10:15 p.m., ESPN). Swig your drink every time the camera cuts to Petersen after a big Broncos play. Saturday: Sleep in. There’s nothing in the first flight of games that need concern you if you’re not a fan of a playing team. Soak up some vitamin D outside. Then at 3:30 p.m., start flipping between Louisville vs. no. 6 Auburn (CBS) and BYU at Nebraska (ABC). The evening schedule gets a touch more crowded, but far from unmanageable with no. 15 Arizona State vs. Texas A&M (7 p.m., ESPN), Texas at no. 11 Notre Dame (7:30 p.m., NBC), and no. 20 Wisconsin vs. no. 3 Alabama (8 p.m., ABC). For a nightcap, hop over to Arkansas State at no. 8 USC (11 p.m., P12N) when Badgers-Bama concludes. Sunday: Sleep in again. Sleep all day, maybe. Interact with your family. Acknowledge your pets. Find a lake and jump in it and stay there for a while. You don’t want to see what Marshall does to visiting Purdue. Monday: There’s one game on the schedule, one that carries more than enough intrigue to stand by itself: no. 1 Ohio State at Virginia Tech, the defending national champs against the only team that beat them last year (8 p.m., ESPN).",2015-09-03T10:10:47+00:00,College Football,Anderson
5,Deshaun Watson Goes Electric: But Can the Second-Year Clemson QB Stay on the Field?,"Clemson’s football team has just wrapped up a round of drills on an outdoor practice field, and two small children have cornered Deshaun Watson. Thanks in large part to the Tigers’ virulent orange and purple uniform scheme, their presence is visible from as far away as low earth orbit, but fans don’t usually get this close, and now the slightly larger child has taken it upon himself to interrogate the starting quarterback. He wants to know if Watson’s surgically repaired knee still hurts. He wants to know what is going on with the renovations to Memorial Stadium across the street. He is curious why Watson’s practice helmet is missing Clemson’s signature paw print icon. Now he would like to try on the helmet. Watson cautions him: “It’s sweaty.” The moppet is undaunted. The adorability is off the charts. This scene would be the most sickeningly precious PR tableau of the preseason if it were staged, but this is all just happening, on a stupefyingly muggy Monday morning in South Carolina, and there’s almost nobody there to see it. It’s tiptoeing right along the edge of too good to be true, which is a sensation that comes up a lot when discussing Watson.

Of course, Clemson is a safe space for stratospheric expectations when it comes to its sophomore sensation. Wherever his ceiling might hover, we don’t appear to have hit it yet. For those of you just tuning in at home, previously on the Deshaun Watson show: The nation’s top-ranked quarterback in the class of 2014 signs on as a future Tajh Boyd replacement, enrolling in school early to take part in spring workouts. A cracked collarbone knocks him out of the spring game. In the Tigers’ third contest of the season, he finds himself replacing Boyd a bit more immediately than he’d planned, getting swapped in for Cole Stoudt in an attempt to goose Clemson’s offense against Florida State. He makes his first collegiate start the following week, against North Carolina, completing 75 percent of his passes for 435 yards and six touchdowns. Two weeks later, he breaks his hand in the first quarter against Louisville and misses the next three games. In mid-November, he returns to play Georgia Tech and sustains a third sidelining injury, this time a knee sprain, in the first quarter of that game. He takes a game week off, promptly tears an ACL in practice, leads the Tigers to victory on one good leg in their regular-season finale over loathed in-state rival South Carolina, and undergoes knee surgery in December. Within that narrow window in which we could actually see Watson play football, here’s what we were treated to: Ninety-three completions on 137 attempts for 1,466 yards. A 67 percent completion rate. Fourteen passing touchdowns, five rushing scores, and two interceptions. And just a general sense that, at 19 years old, the game already looks slow when seen through his eyes, that he can already see the Matrix. There are caveats in both directions with this stat line. These were not world-beating defenses Watson was crushing. But most of the football we got to see him play came in the first half of a true freshman season. So with all of that in mind, what do we know? For select stretches of time, with three to four fully functioning limbs, he looked like that rare player swept in on a wave of hype who actually manages to keep his head above water. Now what? ??? You won’t get an answer from Watson, who prefers to let his play speak for him. Really, he prefers not to speak at all; it’s hard to hear him talking outdoors over a distant lawn mower, hard to fathom how his teammates can possibly hear him down on Death Valley’s field. He’s always been a quiet kid; he’s perfectly aware of his potential, but that knowledge isn’t outwardly affecting him, not even after that tantalizing glimpse of a first-year campaign. Every word out of his mouth is measured and matter-of-fact, and every sentence is like a torn page from a motivational quote-a-day calendar. “I feel very confident about myself and my team and the role I have,” he says. “I just try to be myself and take whatever comes with the position.” Watson is simultaneously conscious of the burden about to be placed upon him to carry the Tigers, who suffered massive defensive attrition in the offseason, and dismissive of it. “If I just do my job and let everyone else do their jobs, there won’t be any pressure. We’ll just go out there and have fun and do what we love to do.” He won’t even name a new favorite receiving target. “I just go out there and find the open guy. And all my guys can make plays.” Something more interesting happens, however, when you talk to Watson’s instructors, who are as ready to praise his work as he is reticent. The 2015 season is days away and every college football team in the country has coaches talking up their guys, but it’s not every day you hear the word “presence” when describing a 19-year-old kid, and it’s even rarer to hear a young player described with these kinds of superlatives. “He was not a normal freshman,” says head coach Dabo Swinney. “It was truly like dealing with a guy who’d been here three or four years. I’ve had some great freshmen that were great players, but I’ve never had one that had the whole package. You try to start off with all these guys [without] assuming anything. You start with, ‘OK, here’s addition and subtraction,’ and then you try and work them up to algebra. He came in here and we’re talking calculus in about two days. That’s Deshaun.” Tyler Smith/Getty Images Clemson co-offensive coordinator Jeff Scott was tipped off to Watson’s ways earlier than he ever thought possible. One Friday night in January 2014, Scott pulled up in front of the football stadium to meet a recruit’s family coming in from out of town. He was a few minutes early, and he remembers the stadium being mostly dark, lit only by the ribbon boards beneath the upper deck. He saw two shadows moving down on the field and slipped inside, thinking some kids had broken in. “And the closer I got,” he says, “walking down, I could see it was Deshaun and Artavis Scott, one of our freshmen receivers. They’d go out there and run a play, and then they’d both run back to the middle of the field, and Deshaun had his playbook there on the ground. They’d talk about that play, and they’d go out there and run another one, and they were doing it in the dark, in January. They’d only been in Clemson for two weeks and it was a Friday night at 9:45.” Ten months later, in that Tigers-Gamecocks showdown, a one-legged Watson would score four of the Tigers’ five touchdowns in their 35-17 victory. Two were goal-line runs. The other two were scoring passes to Artavis Scott, a 53-yarder in the first quarter and a 70-yarder in the third. “You know,” says Jeff Scott, “as a coach, you call the play, they line up defensively, you’re standing on the sideline, you can see what defense they’re in, and you can already process where the ball needs to go before the ball’s ever snapped. And we’ve seen this over and over. And now Deshaun, in his first game, going through the progressions, he’s exactly right. Just every time. It’s all just happening right before your eyes.” ??? For Clemson to make a playoff run in 2015, it’s all going to have to keep happening, and in a hurry. This year’s offense will be a unit of less-than-familiar faces, and young ones. The Tigers’ second-year quarterback will have to be a reliable constant in a sea of changes, starting1 with the loss of most of the offensive line. Last season’s top running back is another young’n, sophomore Wayne Gallman. Along with Artavis Scott and 1,000-yard receiver Mike Williams, the squad is welcoming an incoming armada of talent at receiver, including one five-star prospect I want to mention simply because his name is Ray-Ray McCloud. The guy who’s supposed to be responsible for Clemson’s kicks and punts, Ammon Lakip, will serve a three-game suspension2 to open the season; two redshirt freshmen are competing to serve in his stead. Defensively, the Tigers are going to drop off in production. It’s going to happen. That’s not a knock on this year’s squad so much as a recognition that last year’s beastly bunch just can’t be replicated that easily. Attrition took six major contributors off last season’s D-line; a seventh player, tackle D.J. Reader, left the team this week. The Tigers are down their two most prolific tacklers at linebacker and lose a couple of key guys in the secondary, but — key for entertainment purposes — they retain the self-proclaimed best corner in the country in Mackensie Alexander. All of those new pieces won’t have a great deal of time to find out what works and what doesn’t in live action. Three of Clemson’s gnarliest-looking games fall within the first six weeks of the season, with a Thursday-night trip to Louisville in Week 3 followed by a bye and back-to-back visits from Notre Dame and Georgia Tech. So as the Tigers defense declines in experience and (at least for a little while) aptitude, how far along the axis can the rising line of Watson and the offense (assuming he clicks with the reshuffled line) meet them to offset that loss? And what happens if, saints preserve us, he doesn’t even get the chance to try? If he’s knocked out of commission again? “All those injuries,” says Jeff Scott, “were really just kind of random. It’d be one thing if he was repeatedly throwing his shoulder out, but he’s not. We’re not going to handcuff Deshaun. For him to be his best, he’s got to be able to go out there and play. We want him to pick and choose times when he’s going to go dive over a pile, or going to step out of bounds. “But it’s not really anything we can spend time worrying about now. If we do, it’s gonna be a long year.” To hear his coaches tell it, the most important update between Watson 1.0 and Watson 2.0 isn’t something that will require all that much exertion, but it’s also not something that can really be taught on a greaseboard or in a VR helmet. He’s still learning how to build a catalogue of opposing defenses that can live between his ears, to master Clemson’s protections the way Swinney wants. But the coaches know that when it comes to preparation, Watson will do everything they ask of him, along with three or four more everythings. They want something now that only Watson can decide to give: more of himself. Having become one of the guys, he must now become the guy. Watson’s fully processing all of this — he seems totally aware that with the starting job already in hand, his now is upon him, and it’s time to do something with all that upside. “The position I’m in, I don’t take it lightly,” he says. “I cherish every moment.”",2015-08-27T11:49:22+00:00,2015 College Football Preview,Anderson
6,The Malzahn Ripple Effect: More Than Just a Jonesboro-Area Jam Band,"It’s August, that time of year when our fancy turns to predicting football games. But through all of that projecting and prognosticating, one important caveat always seems to go unsaid: Nobody knows a damn thing. We don’t. We can’t. We can, however, always count on hindsight to be 20-20. So instead of trying to predict what’s going to happen, why don’t we take a shot at what might have happened — specifically to Gus Malzahn, a key pivot point upon which the SEC as we know it spins? All hirings have ripple effects that resonate as far across the country as there is football, but the consequences of Malzahn’s professional moves seem more pronounced because he’s made so many of them in such a short amount of time. He’s perpetually in demand, and for good reason. His first Auburn team famously delivered a 12-2 record in 2013, culminating in an appearance in the BCS National Championship Game. (That team lost to Florida State. But they were there.) His second squad went 8-5; smart money expects Auburn to contend for the SEC West this year. A decade ago, this guy was coaching high school ball. So how did we get here? We pick up our story in 2010, five years after Malzahn left Springdale High in Arkansas, and following stints as offensive coordinator of Houston Nutt’s Razorbacks, two years as OC for Todd Graham in Tulsa, and three seasons crafting offenses for Gene Chizik in Auburn. In the real world, Malzahn remained on the Plains for one more season, then left to take the head-coaching job at Arkansas State. Today we consider roads not taken. In 2010, following the abrupt resignation of Bobby Johnson and one 2-10 season under interim head coach Robbie Caldwell,1 the Commodores made a run at Gene Chizik’s second-year offensive coordinator. Had Malzahn headed to Nashville, he would’ve inherited a team with enough talent to go 6-6 (2-6) in what ended up being James Franklin’s first year as head coach. Let’s say he found enough to work with in the ground game to turn the two home losses into wins. The Commodores are now 8-4 (4-4), and rather than the Liberty Bowl, they make a Gator Bowl appearance against Ohio State on January 2. That would also knock Georgia down from sole possession of first place in the SEC East to a tie with South Carolina, which the Gamecocks would win. So Vandy might even be a candidate for the Outback Bowl, going from dead last in its division to a top-tier bowl game in the span of one year. Not too bad at all. The following season, our imaginary Commodores still get blown out of the water by Georgia in Athens and by Florida in Nashville. Real Vandy’s four-point loss to no. 9 South Carolina in the season opener, though, all of a sudden gets pretty interesting. So might their 23-13 loss at Northwestern in Week 2. If you flip those two games, Vandy still finishes behind Georgia and Florida in the division (both of whom went 7-1 in conference), but the Dores have achieved their first 10-win season in program history. That could bump them up in the postseason to either play Clemson in the Peach Bowl or Michigan in the Outback. Here’s the thing, though: Even if Vandy loses both bowl games under Malzahn in this alternate timeline, he’s still built a head-coaching record of 18-8 at the SEC’s perennial punching bag. Name-brand athletic directors around the country are going to be burning up his phone … and it’s safe to assume one of them is Jay Jacobs. So! Malzahn ends up back at Auburn anyway; the butterfly effect is largely contained within the SEC, and the landscape of college football realigns to closely resemble our own. Real-life Malzahn, though, had another opportunity to split from the Tigers the very next year, and a chance to alter the path of a different conference. Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images In real-world Larry Fedora’s first year, the Tar Heels went 8-4, 5-3 in conference. They ended up tied for first in the ACC Coastal with Georgia Tech and Miami in one of those three-way logjams where everybody is 1-1 against everybody else. But since UNC and Miami were both under postseason bans, 6-6 Tech went to the conference title game, so a Malzahn presence in the captain’s chair wouldn’t have changed much about the 2012 season. The next year, though, he would’ve had a pretty good shot at improving on Fedora’s 6-6 (4-4) regular-season record. UNC lost to South Carolina, East Carolina, and Virginia Tech by double digits in 2013, but the Heels’ losses at Georgia Tech and at home against no. 10 Miami and no. 24 Duke were by a total margin of 14 points. If we assume Malzahn would have favored dual-threat QB Marquise Williams over pure passer Bryn Renner, and might have gotten more mileage out of Williams that season, try moving those three games to the win column:2 All of a sudden the Tar Heels are 9-3 (7-1) and win the Coastal Division title outright. They probably still get clocked by FSU in the conference title game, but they probably would’ve come closer than 45-7, as Duke did. Less certain is how much Malzahn would’ve been able to move the needle in Chapel Hill in 2014. The real Heels again went 6-6 (4-4), but only one of those losses (Notre Dame) was by less than two TDs, thanks to UNC’s dreadful defense. It’s hard to think the ceiling for an Imaginary Malzahn 2014 UNC team would’ve been more than eight or so wins. Then again, Real UNC did manage to beat Georgia Tech last year, so if you flip even one of the Heels’ conference losses to a win in our alternate timeline, they’ve at least managed to make the division race interesting right up into mid-November. A mildly pleasant outcome that doesn’t try to get too fancy: Lines up just about perfectly with the current state of expectations in the real-world Coastal Division, doesn’t it? Moving on down the timeline: In our world, Malzahn didn’t go to Vanderbilt, or to North Carolina. Instead, he split with Chizik to spend a year in the patented Head Coachin’ Incubator at Arkansas State. What might have become of Auburn’s team had Malzahn elected to stick it out on the Plains? Given the steady decline of Real Auburn’s defense and the absence of a proven starter at QB, 2012 probably would’ve been a frustrating year for the Tigers even without an OC transition. Still, as poorly as the actual ’12 team performed, they did play a few good teams close. With Malzahn’s experience still in town to steady them, beating no. 14 Clemson in the Chick-fil-A Kickoff is within the realm of possibility, as is beating no. 2 LSU at home (rather than losing 12-10). But they still lose to Ole Miss, Texas A&M, Georgia, and Alabama, so with a 5-7 (2-6) record, Chizik probably still gets fired, considering that the Tigers’ last three conference games of 2012 are all multiple-TD blowouts. At the very least, he’s on an even hotter seat than before, the pursuit of his better assistants by other schools is getting feverish, and an escape hatch is looking more and more attractive. Where does he end up? Kentucky, Tennessee, and Southern Miss are all open at this point, but the most entertaining notion is one of Malzahn back at Arkansas, where interim coach John L. Smith has just been given the not-at-all-shocking news that a three-win season has killed his case for the permanent job. (John L. won four games in real-life 2012, but in this timeline we’re assuming that Auburn managed to beat Arkansas.) This would be a homecoming hire of a different sort than his real-life return to the Tigers in 2013; local factions of Razorback loyalists would not remember fondly the events of his previous tenure in Fayetteville. Bret Bielema and Arkansas AD Jeff Long had been courting one another for a bit, but suppose there were forces in the booster set who’d want to bring Malzahn back, who’d want a homegrown option, and who’d be willing to swallow back bile in hopes of future glory. Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images Had Malzahn moved on from Arkansas State to the Razorbacks rather than the Tigers in December 2012, he would’ve faced a lot of the same issues Bielema did in Real Fayetteville — namely, he would have to have taken a roster optimized for Bobby Petrino’s aerial attack and goosed the ground game. The defense was a wreck, and a one-year turnaround of that unit under Malzahn is hard to imagine, particularly facing that midseason stretch of Texas A&M, Florida, South Carolina, and Alabama, all ranked in the top 20. Three of the Real Razorbacks’ nine losses in 2013 were by single digits, so if we give them those three (including the regular-season finale at no. 17 LSU, which they led until the final 90 seconds), they make bowl eligibility. But that’s highly optimistic. The following year, though, could’ve been fun. Four of Real Arkansas’s six losses in 2014 came by a single score or less.3 If you think Malzahn could have boosted the offense enough in that span of time to at least split those games, the Hogs’ regular-season record goes from 6-6 (2-6 SEC) to 8-4 (4-4), potentially elevating them to a national ranking and/or a New Year’s bowl game — not to mention knocking Alabama (and the entire SEC!) out of College Football Playoff contention, to be replaced by Baylor or TCU. WOOOOOO PIG. (Imaginary Auburn in this timeline, by the way, plucks Jimbo Fisher from what was then quite the cash-strapped athletic department at Florida State. It’s all a square dance, man.) There’s a sub-rabbit-hole here, too, if you squint just right, where the Arkansas State job that launches Malzahn into one SEC head-coaching gig or another isn’t even open. That position was vacant, in the real world, because of Houston Nutt’s implosion at Ole Miss. If Jevan Snead doesn’t declare early for the draft, that’s good for probably two more Rebel wins, and for Nutt keeping his job through at least 2012, which in turn keeps Hugh Freeze at Arkansas State. So where does that leave our boy Malzahn? Let’s answer that question with a question. You’re the Board of Trustees of the University of Alabama, charged with governing the athletic interests of both Tuscaloosa and Birmingham, and you have an opportunity to hire away Auburn’s hotshot OC for the UAB job. What do you do? The last thing you want to do is make the Blazers legitimately competitive, but if it means screwing over your Iron Bowl rivals, there’s a scenario in which you throw enough cash Malzahn’s way to make a ground-level rebuilding job attractive, figuring he’ll springboard his way into something bigger and better in a few years anyway and he’ll be out of your fair state entirely. Tempting, ain’t it? Call this the “fourth act of It’s a Wonderful Life” option: What if Bobby Petrino had gotten the Auburn gig after the 2003 season, after all? This is a really interesting scenario, because if university officials had succeeded in their plot to disappear Tommy Tuberville, Petrino would’ve been inheriting that incredible Auburn team that went 13-0 in real-life 2004. Would he have been able to match that? Signs point to “yes,” since we know the offense would’ve been amazing, and the defensive talent on that Tigers squad was so strong it probably would’ve survived Bobby P.’s customary policy of benign neglect toward anything that isn’t offense. Either way, though, can you really see Petrino being a lifer at Auburn? Let’s be generous and say he gives it four years and takes off unexpectedly after the 2007 season, perilously close to Signing Day, for the NFL. John L. Smith is tapped as Auburn’s interim head coach, and their 2008 season is a shitshow (which is to say, exactly as it was in real life), so Auburn is still looking for a new head coach after the ’08 season. In this timeline, though, Gene Chizik probably doesn’t become that coach, because his previous experience at Auburn would be only two seasons as defensive coordinator, and he wouldn’t have been part of the juggernaut 2004 campaign. Who does Auburn end up hiring? I’m ever so glad you asked that question, because the answer is: TURNER GILL. Although. Although. If Petrino had left for the NFL a year earlier, after the 2006 season, like his real-life counterpart, you know who was ripe for the plucking to bring back out of the NFL ranks into college ball, right? You’re not gonna make me say it, right? You want me to say it? Nick Saban, head coach, Auburn Tigers. But we digress. Breathe. Breathe, dammit. We’re almost home. Back to the Gus-at-Arkansas scenario for one final delicious plot twist: Malzahn’s 2014 Razorbacks manage to best the real-life result, a one-point Bama win, and eke out a Hawgs home victory over the seventh-ranked team in the country. Sick of this shit, Saban casts a wandering eye back in time to Texas, then shakes it off and casts a second eye back to the ranks of the pros. Dan Snyder, never one to abandon a bad idea once he sees it, personally pilots a C-17 over the Sabans’ lake house, shoving crate after crate of crisp $100 bills out the cargo door. Saban’s move to Washington is announced the day after the 2014 SEC Championship Game. Imaginary Bama goes on to lose, as in real life, to Ohio State in the inaugural College Football Playoff semifinal. The morning of the national championship game, Gus Malzahn is announced as the new head coach of the Alabama Crimson Tide. How much of this almost happened? Only Jimmy Sexton can tell the tale, and that means it stops with him. Don’t none of us reading this make enough money for him to tell us.

7,You Are a Hater Just for Reading This Headline: The Curious State of Notre Dame Football,"“Everybody has great offseasons, right?” asked Brian Kelly at his first preseason press conference a couple of weeks ago. “Who doesn’t have a great offseason?” He’s right, of course; August is peak harvest time for the ripest, richest coachspeak. But those of you allergic to Fighting Irish football hype and those of you forever allegiant to Touchdown Jesus, hunker down and know that you suffer together: Notre Dame’s going to be really good this year. Really. (Well … probably.)

Last season, Notre Dame was slotted by the Associated Press at no. 17 in the preseason poll. The Irish got off to a 6-0 start, blanking Michigan1 and edging out then–no. 14 Stanford, and rose as high as no. 5 before dropping a heartbreaker to Florida State in Tallahassee. The team ended up losing five of its last six regular-season contests and defeating LSU in the Music City Bowl to give Brian Kelly his third 8-5 finish in five years in South Bend. Both the offense and defense ended the regular season in states of disarray, but two factors stand out from the rubble of the 2014 record: increasingly erratic results from quarterback Everett Golson — who has since transferred to Florida State — and an already-young defense that was thoroughly bombarded by injuries. Earlier this month, Kelly called the 2015 squad his “deepest group of components” yet assembled during his tenure. “However,” he said, “that doesn’t get it done. It’s how this group comes together.” He’s not wrong about the depth. Despite the departure of Golson, this team has more eye-popping potential than the 2012 squad did. That group rode an undefeated regular season, including victories over then–no. 10 Michigan State, no. 18 Michigan, no. 17 Stanford, and no. 8 Oklahoma, into the national title game (where they were summarily dispatched by Alabama, but still: It’s not a place you expect to find a team that needed triple overtime to beat a 4-4 Pitt squad). This latest edition of the Irish includes 20 returning starters and boasts enough talent at the offensive skill positions to provide a safe learning environment for newish starting quarterback Malik Zaire. The dual-threat junior saw limited action last season in the Arizona State and USC games and started against LSU, where he scored one rushing and one passing touchdown. This is not a lot of data from which to project the upcoming campaign, but whatever other qualities Zaire may turn out to possess, it seems unbelievable that he’ll be subjected to the same rotten turnover luck as Golson, who at times in 2014 seemed the target of a baleful deity, one who liked nothing more than flicking the football in surprising directions once it left the quarterback’s grasp.2 Zaire will be shielded by an experienced offensive line that is without longtime starter Christian Lombard but retains left tackle Ronnie Stanley, who skipped the NFL draft to return for his senior season. New OC hire Mike Sanford’s toy box contains a 1,000-yard receiver in William Fuller and two 500-yarders in Corey Robinson and Chris Brown. A fourth, slot receiver C.J. Prosise, has been working out at running back, where the Irish bring back last year’s leading rusher, Tarean Folston, but have reportedly lost the sidelined Greg Bryant to a Florida juco. Even with an ongoing quarterback transition, the offense is a lesser concern than the defense, the development of which was repeatedly stalled last year as the unit lost one player to injury after another (after another). The summer has not been as kind as it could be to second-year DC Brian VanGorder: Kelly announced Saturday that redshirt junior defensive tackle Jarron Jones, who recorded 7.5 tackles for loss and 1.5 sacks in 2014, will miss the upcoming season following an MCL injury. His backup is Jerry Tillery, a true freshman and former four-star prospect out of Shreveport. The team retains its five most prolific defensive backs. Follow the development of corner Cole Luke; as a sophomore, he intercepted four passes and broke up 11 more, forced two fumbles, and recorded two tackles for losses. 2015 will pit him against the likes of quarterbacks Deshaun Watson and Cody Kessler.3 Jonathan Daniel/Getty Images Notre Dame linebacker Jaylon Smith celebrates a tackle for a loss against Michigan. But the place to train your eyes will be the linebacking corps, returning five of six members who recorded a tackle for the Irish in 2014. The guy roaming around with the assured grace of an apex predator is Jaylon Smith, who led the unit in tackles in 2014. Joe Schmidt, the former walk-on who rose to become a starter, returns from a broken ankle sustained against Navy. Schmidt is one of those guys with a natural gift for stage-managing a defense while the game is in progress; by midseason last year, Smith had become his lieutenant for on-field adjustments. The prospect of both of them getting to play a full season together is pretty swell, if you’re into cerebral malice. One final piece not to overlook: Kicker/punter Kyle Brindza, who ranked third in the nation last season in touchbacks, has been lost to the Lions. (As in he’s playing professional football in Detroit, not as in he’s been spirited away to ancient Rome and thrown into gladiatorial combat. Emotionally, those two experiences are only the tiniest bit different.) Picking up where he left off are sophomore Tyler Newsome and an incoming freshman, top-ranked specialist Justin Yoon. So Notre Dame, as the bluehairs say, has the horses. Now, the conundrum: Where to place the Irish in your expectations constellation for 2015? If it feels like large swaths of the college-football-consuming population are locked in an unending struggle between This Is Notre Dame’s Year and Notre Dame Is Overrated, it’s only because that’s exactly what they’re doing, and they are tireless at it. Crowing about Notre Dame football and hating on Notre Dame football have both become their own discrete spectator sports, and it’s hard to tell at any given moment which band of fans is having more fun at its chosen pastime. Best of all, there’s no end in sight to determining who’s right: It might surprise both sides of the aisle to learn that, since the turn of this century, Fighting Irish football has entered the season ranked eight times, and come in unranked eight times, and that five of those ranked preseason teams have gone on to finish outside of the top 25 cutoff, while four of the unranked teams climbed into the top 25 by season’s end. So by that totally infallible science, our courses are set just by looking at the roster, and the schedule, and making the educated guess that there’s no way the Irish get left out of next week’s AP poll, right? If you’re a Fighting Irish hater, time to sharpen your fangs and howl at what you view as the perpetual glow of expectation surrounding the program, all the while bracing yourself for a potential playoff run! If you’re a Notre Dame diehard, and you’re superstitious, it’s time to get nervous, because it looks like they’re going to be a very good football team, which is where things sometimes start to get weird. Kelly has established a floor of 8-5 for the program during his time in South Bend, and with this roster, that ground level appears impermeable this season. But for teams with history and resources comparable to Notre Dame’s, elevated expectations are natural law. Within the program, they probably don’t even think about it, any more than you think about gravity as you go about your day. “Our team knows where they are,” said Kelly. “They read the clippings. They know that in the preseason that a lot of teams are getting accolades. They also know it’s not going to help them beat Texas.” The Irish might not need any help beating the Longhorns, but Notre Dame’s offense versus a Charlie Strong defense is reason enough to put on NBC. The really interesting first hurdle, though, won’t come until Week 3, with a visit from potentially deadly Georgia Tech. And while it’d be deeply silly to peek past September at this point, tread just a couple of days into October and look at what the Irish have to do: go into Clemson and defend against Watson and pals, who’ll be coming off a bye week. Those three games aren’t the last you’ll want to see of Notre Dame this year, but they’ll tell you a lot. “Reply Hazy: Try Again In Week 5” reads this contraband Magic 8 Ball. Unfortunately, those toys rarely add “and then start praying thrice a day to whichever saints govern the well-being of tendons,” but in the case of Notre Dame, they probably should. This post has been updated to reflect Brian Kelly’s announcement that KeiVarae Russell has been cleared by the NCAA.",2015-08-18T08:47:11+00:00,2015 College Football Preview,Anderson
8,Big 12 Bombers Reload: TCU and Baylor Face the Rite of Spring Football,"In the waning days of spring football practice at Texas Christian University, Gary Patterson sat chatting with a gaggle of reporters in a conference room that looks out over his home turf of Moncrief Field. Backlit as he was by a brightly overcast sky, framed by the pale pillars of Amon G. Carter Stadium, it was hard to tell if he might be a little green at the gills after imbibing so much offense over the past couple of weeks. Patterson’s Horned Frogs, newly outfitted with Air-Raiding wings, metamorphosed into a team of shocking offensive potency last year, a substantial shift for a defensive lifer to swallow. If you’ve ever heard Gary Patterson speak for more than a minute, you’ve probably heard him expound on his ideal football universe, one in which his team wins every game by a single point. Under new co-coordinators Sonny Cumbie and Doug Meacham, TCU wielded the second-most prolific scoring attack in the country in 2014, averaging more than 46 points per game.1 And entering the second year of operation in the offensive overhaul, the Frogs have taken to the skies with an early ferocity. “Now every scrimmage, we get about 10 new double passes, reverse passes, throwback passes,” said Patterson. “It’s like a damn circus.” But if ever there’s a time for a good sideshow, it’s during spring ball. Down I-35 in Waco, home of the only team to score more points per game last year than the Horned Frogs, the Baylor Bears are making offseason headlines with a marvelous freak: LaQuan McGowan, a 400-pound tight end with hands the size of gallon milk jugs, who made a splash appearance in the Cotton Bowl and whose head coach is already calling him a “cult hero.”2 There is actual football to be worked on, to be sure; new wrinkles to add in and iron out, new personnel to adjust to. TCU lost 236 tackles’ worth of linebacker with the departures of Paul Dawson and Marcus Mallet; Baylor must replace starting quarterback Bryce Petty and defensive battle captain Bryce Hager, and each program has a new coordinator on one side of the ball, following the retirement of Horned Frogs DC Dick Bumpas and Tulsa’s hiring of Bears OC Phil Montgomery as head coach. But this offseason, the most crucial function of spring ball in both Waco and Fort Worth may have been mental. Much pored-over, occasionally hilarious, and frequently useless as a prognosticating tool, spring-game season is an oversize to-do signifying not a lot, but we collectively compensate for being so far removed from the last national title game and the onset of the next season by attaching importance to pretty much whatever we want. TCU and Baylor will both enter the 2015 campaign as conference front-runners, and both entered the offseason in sore need of a psychic reset. The events of late 2014 are going to take some getting over in this league. ??? Tom Pennington/Getty LaQuan McGowan When is a New Year’s Six bowl sort of a downer ending to a season? When is a New Year’s Six bowl appearance in and of itself a kind of disappointment? When you’re affiliated with either of these Big 12 programs, and you haven’t quite gotten over games you think you should’ve been in instead, and you have a not unreasonable argument. Imagine being on that Horned Frogs team, this past season, and watching the no. 4 Ohio State Buckeyes, the final team selected for the first-ever football playoff at the expense of two teams from your own league, take the title game in the JerryDome, a scant half hour from your own home field. Imagine watching while trying to avoid dwelling on the fact that Ohio State beat Alabama in the semifinals to get there, and that Alabama’s one loss during the regular season came at Ole Miss, a team you yourselves just annihilated 42-3 in the Peach Bowl. Now imagine you’re Baylor, and you’ve just lost a heart-throttling Cotton Bowl, and you too think TCU could beat a couple of playoff teams, and you beat TCU in the regular season. From a nonpartisan, third-party perspective, whatever you think might have actually happened had either Big 12 team been selected for that final playoff spot, just try to say it wouldn’t fester in your mind. How could you not wonder? How could you not let yourself get devoured by what-ifs? Coaches deal with this kind of mass psychological sloughing every year, must coax teams past spiritual sand traps every offseason, and 90 miles and a couple hours apart in April, two scorned skippers of the Big 12 offered up nearly identical answers with a singular mind-set: It’s all about controlling what you can control. In spring practice, controlling what you can control comes easiest. There’s lots of tangible influence to exert. There are months between low-consequence drills and real action. There are easily apparent problems to address, and a finite number of solutions to sort through. Rote conditioning tasks can take on a meditative quality after a while, with the right mind-set, and there’s nothing like literally putting one foot in front of the other to create some distance between one season and the next. While the players do that, their coaches endeavor to find a balance between using last year’s postseason as motivation and allowing their teams to dwell on it too long. “I think you do both,” said Art Briles. “I mean, I have, from a personal standpoint, and I know our players feel the same way. I think there’s a high degree of frustration, of lost opportunity.” Briles allowed that the Cotton Bowl finish has him climbing the walls in his head some nights. “I still am … But you gotta use it for motivation, because if you allow it to beat you up, it’ll beat you up.” A mind targeted on the present can also buffer against apprehension of a future that could keep shutting the Big 12 out of the playoffs.3 Baylor and TCU are new money, upstarts in the league of revered Texas and Oklahoma programs,4 and both coaches seem to accept as natural law that as long as college football’s postseason is determined by fallible humans — and when will it not be? — they need to be perceived as capital-B Brands to get past the gatekeepers. Amplifying these barriers are the perception problems the Big 12 grapples with as a conference. League commissioner Bob Bowlsby emerged from spring meetings with the impression that his conference operates at a disadvantage due to its lack of a conference championship game.5 There’s been no major movement toward instituting one just yet, but the league has formalized tiebreaker rules6 to allow it to at least name a conference champion, which you’d think would be an already-cemented part of the process of, like, being a football conference in the first place, but last year, not so much! And when you look at what all of this striving is done in service of? This brand-new solution to the college football postseason comes complete with its own unsolvable dilemma. There was no mutually satisfactory path to a four-team field in 2014, which made some late machinations of the selection committee appear downright whimsical to certain parties. “The one consistency,” said Patterson, “is it’s never going to be fair. No matter what we’ve called it in my 33 years in coaching, no matter what thing we have, whether it’s the BCS or the Coaches Poll or whatever we’ve had through the years, somebody has felt like they’ve gotten screwed.” ??? Scott Cunningham/Getty Images Gary Patterson Control what you can control. Patterson and Briles are reminding themselves of that, perhaps, as much as anyone, as they hone their teams’ concentration on the here and now. If they didn’t, they’d maybe be out of their minds in a hurry. It’s kind of astonishing they already aren’t, every coach, all the time. Springtime is a fine time for inventory, and if you’ll take a moment, take a couple steps back, and catalogue every element in play here, it doesn’t take long to realize that the landscape constructed for this children’s game is a Seussian labyrinth. The host of usual obstacles and myriad moving parts that can go wrong between the last week of August and the first week of December are endless high hurdles in and of themselves; the number of teams that actually manage to go undefeated in any given year stands self-apparent as the greatest argument for how difficult that is to accomplish. That’s just during the season. The problems of a big-time head football coach are problems you’d quickly swap yours for, maybe, but they’d still be problems once they were yours — the inequalities, the irrationalities, the insecurities, the stark unknowns. Reconciling plenty of money with little stability. Confronting the conundrum of the student-athlete, with neither money nor stability. Entitled boosters, unscrupulous agents, sniping media, the Hungry Hungry Hippo recruiting treadmill. Imagine living with and being pressured to thrive in that kind of farcical environment, to be so above reproach that you can counteract all of that plus an untold multitude of butterfly effects on and off the field, in and out of your jurisdiction, every single year. Training 18-to-22-year-old synapses not to misfire, or to misfire as infrequently as possible and if possible not all at the same time, and sometimes even that’s not enough. Squint your eyes and you’ll see Sisyphus on the top row of the stadium bleachers, pointing and laughing with a giant foam finger on each hand. Coaches are paid preposterously to cope with this preposterousness, but still: To men who’ve dedicated their lives to a game of inches measured on an x-y axis, it can’t not rankle. There was this frenzied rush, both before and after the playoffs themselves, to shore up or tear down endless hypotheses of This Team couldn’t do what That Team did because of This Cherry-Picked Set of Factors. That’s not a new phenomenon, and it probably won’t ever dissipate. But setting aside the psychology of sport-based tribalism for another discussion, how many of us are deep down just railing against the absurdity of it all? That there will be years, a lot of them, in which we’ll never be able to determine who is best, not for sure, and that untold millions of dollars will be spent each year regardless in putting on a show saying, No, we know — lookit, shiny? There was a contrarian joy to be found, watching Ohio State win it all in January after being the last team in in December, but even then it was hard to accept that the season would conclude with no further questions taken. All of this by way of saying: It’s a lot to process for a human brain, college football. Here at the top of the Big 12, the biggest challenges facing Baylor and TCU this spring may lie between the ears, and for them — for all of us, maybe? — spring football’s highest value may be spiritual, and this time of year most valuable. When absurdities of the season are the furthest out of sight, mathematical injustices the most readily kept at bay. The safest time to tiptoe up to the abyss, peer in, see the fewest pairs of eyes blinking back, yell “ROLL TIDE!” into the black depths for good measure, and then slink back to overthinking a preseason top 25. By August, we’ll all have regrown our thick coating of manic glee, and this will all seem normal again. Until then, anything is still possible and nothing hurts, unless you’re the guy trying to tackle LaQuan McGowan.",2015-05-18T14:11:44+00:00,College Football,Anderson
9,"Snakes on the Plains: The Strange, Surprisingly Popular World of Rattlesnake Rodeos","The late morning is thick with humidity; this could pass for summer weather in a lot of places, but it’s springtime in the Deep South. I’m standing near a cluster of men leaning on their golf clubs, hushed to respectful silence. It’s the final weekend of the Masters, but we’re hundreds of miles from Augusta. On a stage erected nearby in the grass, the town’s mayor is standing at the end of a long line of area dignitaries. You can pick him out by his short-sleeved official event polo, embroidered with a diamondback snake on the breast where the alligator would go, with “MAYOR” below the snake in neon-green letters. He addresses the families assembled in the stands, the milling throng threading through the carnival booths, and the line of beauty pageant winners organized tallest to smallest. The threat of inclement weather has dampened the turnout some, but his enthusiasm is undimmed. More Great Outdoors Life’s Rich Pageant: Meet a Florida Man “Good morning! It’s gonna be a great day! We’re supposed to have some sunshine coming out. I believe the rain’s over. We’ve got some great entertainment today, but right now, we’re gonna start the Rattlesnake Rodeo off with prayer.” This is Opp, a town of around 7,000 people deep inside Alabama’s coastal plain, and this is the opening ceremony of the town’s 55th annual Rattlesnake Rodeo. Stewart Young from Opp’s Southside Baptist Church takes over the microphone. “Father God, we give you great thanks for this day, and the opportunity to gather together as a community, and to celebrate life. And I just pray that this will be a day that will be filled with laughter and smiles. I pray for Your hand of protection, upon each and every one that is here. And we would be remiss, during this day, if we did not take pause to give thanks, and to pray for the protection of the brave men and women of our armed forces, that at this very moment are stationed around this world protecting our freedom, which enables us to have events such as this. We are a blessed, blessed people. We live in a blessed country, a blessed state, and a blessed community. May we never, ever forget that. May we never forget Your magnitude of blessings upon us. You’re an awesome God. You are awesome in all Your ways. In the name of Jesus Christ, we pray, amen.” Once the recording of the Gaither Vocal Band singing the national anthem finishes blaring out from the speakers, the men with the clubs will go back to work. They’re snake handlers for the rodeo, volunteers with years, sometimes decades of experience toting putters that have been converted into snake-wrangling hooks in home workshops.1 While the festival is on, they’re charged with maintaining the snake pit, staging the snake races, subsequently retrieving the peevish participants in the snake races, and fielding questions from more than 13,000 visitors2 throughout the weekend. ??? Holly Anderson I should back up just a little bit here, before anyone gets too excited, and disabuse you of a couple of notions that might be percolating: There are no tiny saddles being affixed to serpent backs at the Rattlesnake Rodeo, nor are there snakes riding horses. (Rattlesnake rodeos are called “rattlesnake roundups” in other parts of the country, and that’s maybe a more accurate descriptor, but it’s just not as fun to say, is it?) Proponents say roundups rid the area of serpents that are vexing to residents and dangerous to hunters; Opp’s own rodeo allegedly began when a favorite bird dog was bitten by a rattler. And while the rodeo does entwine itself thickly with area churches — services will be held on the grounds on Sunday, and a Christian music concert is scheduled to close out the festival that night — we’re not talking about some kind of Pentecostal hoedown. This particular roundup was founded by a town businessman in cooperation with the local Jaycees chapter. The first Opp rodeo was held in a restaurant, and it has since migrated to a couple of different locations before settling in Channel Lee Stadium. One snake handler tells the story of a rodeo staged in nearby Andalusia, sparsely attended by Andalusians because it was originally an Opp project but spurned by Opp residents because it was in Andalusia — and there’s high-school-football-based beef at the root of this particular tale, but this is Alabama, so you don’t need me to tell you that. What began as a low-key show-and-tell (and-then-maybe-skin) has ballooned into the biggest annual event on Opp’s social calendar. The atmosphere you want to picture here, to get the correct impression, is basically that of a county fair with reptiles, operating on the incontrovertible premise that any excuse for a bouncy castle is a good one. The rodeo now encompasses such events as a 5K run and the beauty pageant. (Contestants do have to interact with the snakes as part of the undertaking, taking turns posing with the pageant’s slithery mascot if they win, but critter contact isn’t a judged event in itself.)3 The rodeo has also done a bit of evolving on the conservation front. Events like these are a target of animal-rights activists; snake handlers and organizers in Opp all avow that rather than being killed on site, as is historical habit and still a practice in use at some other roundups, all of this year’s serpentine charges will be carted off to a lab in Middle Tennessee after the festival, where their venom will be used to produce antivenin. There is fried snake meat available at the concession stands at the top of the bleachers, but I’m told it’s imported from Texas. ??? Holly Anderson All of the live-snake-based activity is centered on Channel Lee’s baseball diamond. There’s a concert stage set up in the outfield; the infield is fenced off to all but reptiles and reptile wranglers. The central attraction of the rodeo is the snake-holding pit, off to one side of the stage. It houses a couple dozen serpents of varying sizes, almost all eastern diamondbacks with a couple timber rattlers slithering around. Some of the largest snakes bear colored adhesive tape tags with numbers scrawled on them. These are the racing snakes, and eight or 10 at a time, they’re being lowered into a large metal trash can and taken to the racing circle for their heats. “We’ve never had anybody bitten in conjunction with the rodeo,” says rodeo coordinator Don Childree as he supervises the loading. Behind where the backstop would be, there’s a white circle about 40 feet in diameter. The can is carried in by two handlers and upended in the center of the circle; the first snake to slither far enough to break the plane of the perimeter is declared the winner. The whole thing is narrated by a local radio DJ in the cadence of a horse race: “And it’s Spirit of Opportunity in the lead, Spirit of Opportunity … does NOT like the camera.” He breaks character only once, when a pen falls to the ground and rolls inside the circle. “I ain’t getting that. That ink pen can rot.” Rooting interests are determined by sponsorships; local businesses and town dignitaries pay to sponsor snakes, with a rotating trophy awarded to the sponsor of the final race’s winner. The best part of this is that the snakes in the race all get names. The one sponsored by the speedway is Checkered Flag. The snake sponsored by J.R.’s Lawnmower Shop is named in honor of J.R. the Mechanickin’ Dog, the store’s beloved mascot who passed away a couple weeks ago. One is simply named Frank. After each heat, longtime MC Kenn Howell takes over the microphone and begins a lengthy educational monologue. “Let me tell you a little something about ol’ Crotalus adamanteus.” I could listen to Kenn talk all day, and it seems like he could go on that long. While he dispenses knowledge on the biology of snake-venom delivery systems; the one-tenth-second strike power of a rattlesnake (“So don’t think you can dodge him or something like that”); how reptiles react to the ambient temperature of their surroundings; and the relative wisdom of keeping these creatures as pets (“There is no such thing as a pet snake, and he isn’t gonna be nice to you. He’s gonna bite you every time he gets the chance”), snake handlers herd their charges toward the fence surrounding the infield to give onlookers on the other side a better look. Kenn isn’t preaching at tomorrow’s services, as far as I know, but maybe he should be. “I don’t know why God made them that way. Maybe he wanted to name something ‘rattlesnake.’” There’s a young woman I didn’t notice before who’s now among the snake-handling volunteers, and Kenn singles her out: “Everyone give that young’un a good hand. I’ll never forget the day she came up to me and said, ‘I want you to teach me to handle the rattlesnakes,’ and I thought, Lord have mercy, here we go again.” When Kenn exhausts his educational monologues, he takes questions from the audience: “If we don’t know your answer, we will get you an answer. How’s that?” Definitely take the snake handlers up on this if you ever get the chance. An innocuous “So how’d you all get into this?” led me straight to one older volunteer’s tale about growing up catching rattlers behind his house, selling them to a place down in Panama City he says doesn’t exist anymore but used to be called “Snaketopia,” and using the proceeds to fund his spring break. “Beer was 25 cents then!” ??? As I’m the product of an Appalachian upbringing, it doesn’t really occur to me to consider the “why” of something like a rattlesnake roundup, but I understand the impulse, and it’s stories like that one that come closest to providing the answer: It’s all in the raising. This determinism is something of a theme at the rodeo; Covington County Commission chair Bill Godwin, during his welcome remarks, said, “I always wondered why the Good Lord gave us rattlesnakes, and now I know. It’s so that Opp would have a symbol for their festival today.” It might be easy, as an outsider, to see a story about a snake festival and gawk, but I don’t feel any more or less reasonable purchasing wristbands to go stare at a pen full of snakes with my pals than I would ponying up to inhale azalea pollen a few hundred miles away to watch famous dudes golf. In this, I promise you, the Masters and the Rattlesnake Rodeo are more alike than you might imagine. Why do we care so much about antediluvian shindigs like these, after all? Because our elders told us to when we were young enough to internalize it. What is it that makes them so special? Nothing, save our insistence that they are. It’s a tradition like any other, sustained by new blood and imprinted tradition. In that way, maybe it is like church. There’s no air of the ridiculous here; as with spring football, we all know deep down that what we’re watching is a little bit goofy, but when in the course of human history has that ever dampened our enthusiasm for a good show? Something else about the absence of any sense of the ludicrous in Opp: The people here have been doing this so long that if they ever felt like curiosities (and I doubt that), they’re over it, and that relaxes everybody. I won’t go so far as to say that this is a “more authentic” version of the American South than a fancy golf outing is (because what does “authenticity” even mean or matter, and is it necessarily a good thing when we’re talking about either golf or reptiles?), but I do know which one feels more inclusive. It’s a strange sensation combination to feel like a long-lost cousin in a crowd of the like-minded and also to know empirically that what all of those like minds are up to is so unusual. I hit my personal weekend nirvana doing a lap around the fair’s perimeter, where booths are set up with carnival food, midway games, and merchandise (I’m coming back for you, specialized concealed-carry purse table). I was late to this particular party, but that didn’t diminish my smug satisfaction that right at that moment, nowhere else on earth was anybody nibbling on a fried Oreo, listening to a local singer belt out Heart’s “Alone” on the concert stage, and imagining she was singing the torch song to a seven-foot poisonous snake.",2015-04-27T08:36:29+00:00,The Great Outdoors,Anderson
10,"College Football Preview, Week 8: Between the Thing to Be Made and Its Maker","Week 8 finds the college football season at its exact midpoint, if you count Army-Navy as Week 15.1 Here we stand, balanced between a wholly chaotic first half of the schedule, and a back half where the stakes only get higher. It is, to be quite honest, kind of a lonely peak. Week 8 is so devoid of marquee power that GameDay is hauling its stage to JMU, but nobody should mind this one bit. First of all, JMU gets GameDay on its campus, an exhausting, exhilarating morning which every student at a football school should get to experience at least once. Second, if this season has taught you anything, it should be that the moment you begin to turn your head on a game is exactly when weird shit’s going to start to happen just out of your field of vision. Week 8 also has brought an early gift in the form of a Tuesday contest: Arkansas State bested Louisiana, 37-27, in a matchup that featured a 21-point second quarter from the Red Wolves off two Fredi Knighten touchdown passes and a 30-yard interception return by Cody Brown. This segment is definitely not sponsored by Sonic and its annual Ragin’ Cajuns–themed burger, because while the effort and affection is laudable, the edible logo on the bun feels possible to consume but unnatural to attempt.2 (All times Eastern.) Top 25 Matchups: Just one, but it’s a good’n, no. 15 Texas A&M at no. 24 Ole Miss (7 p.m., ESPN). This is one of those realigned SEC rivalries that feels like it has been played annually since time immemorial. With LSU still undefeated and Alabama at 3-1 in league play, the loser of this contest will break up a bit of a logjam and tumble down the SEC standings to join the likes of Mississippi State, Auburn, and Arkansas. How High Are the Week 8 Stakes? High as a stray balloon. Could be anywhere. Maybe bobbing just above your head. Maybe way out in the atmosphere somewhere. Maybe adopted by a French moppet.  Because the thing about having no other ranked teams playing each other this week is that Saturday is going to go one of two ways: Either we’ll all have a nice sleepy day sacked out in front of this slate, or an unranked squad’s gonna pull a Top 25 program down off a ledge. Undercards of Interest: While you’re waiting for Aggies-Rebels to get under way, conference contests of note in the earlier flights include no. 6 Clemson at Miami (noon, ABC) and Texas Tech at no. 17 Oklahoma (3:30 p.m., ABC/ESPN2). Rivalry Game of the Week: It sure as shit ain’t Tennessee at no. 8 Alabama (3:30 p.m., CBS), I can tell you that much, not until they put the stupid thing in the right place on the calendar. If you’re going to insist on saddling a series with an unwieldy title like Third Saturday in October, just put it there. This is soooo much less complicated than changing a conference name in realignment and getting the 10-team league called something other than the Big 12. Where my strict constructionists at?? Anyway. Thank Football Jesus for Indiana at no. 7 Michigan State and the Old Brass Spittoon (3:30 p.m., ABC/ESPN2). Yes, for those of you scoring at home, that is the second spittoon traveling trophy featured this season in this space, and yes, this is the greatest sport on earth. Grudge Match of the Week: Former stomping grounds fight! James Franklin’s current Nittany Lions and former Terrapins3 meet in Baltimore (Penn State vs. Maryland, 3:30 p.m., ESPN) in a game that last year featured the most bitter Big Ten burn imaginable, a skipped handshake. And in the SEC, Gus Malzahn’s actual Auburn Tigers meet the Arkansas Razorbacks, for whom Malzahn spent time as an assistant in the world we currently inhabit and also as a head coach in this made-up universe (noon, SECN). This Week in Why? The viewer-disserving scourge of upper-versus-lower division games isn’t going away, but there has to be a line somewhere. 5-2 BYU is hosting Wagner, which is currently winless at FCS football. Where’s the neighborliness? Frequently Asked Questions How many undefeated teams play this weekend? Twelve, none of which are playing each other or even another ranked team. How many winless teams play this weekend? Four, three of which are probably not going to drop that zero on Saturday: UCF hosting no. 21 Houston, North Texas visiting 6-1 Marshall, and Kansas dropping in on no. 14 Oklahoma State. Your best bet to see a first win is 1-5 Troy at 0-6 New Mexico State (8 p.m., ESPN3). Scott Halleran/Getty Images Texas A&M quarterback Kyle Allen. Thursday: It’s a good time to look in on no. 22 Temple as it visits East Carolina (7 p.m., ESPN2), but don’t sleep on Georgia Southern at Appalachian State (7:30 p.m., ESPNU); the Eagles and Mountaineers have 10 wins between them already. More #Pac12AfterDark action lurks late with no. 20 Cal at UCLA (9 p.m., ESPN). Friday: Does reading “no. 18 Memphis” feel as fun as typing “no. 18 Memphis”? This will serve as your reminder that no. 18 Memphis plays at Tulsa (8 p.m., ESPN), and that Three 6 Mafia won an Oscar before Scorsese. In contests unrelated to Academy Award–winning rappers, Utah State visits San Diego State (10:30 p.m., ESPN2). Saturday: Week 8’s marked lack of headliners affords an excellent opportunity for you to check out some off-the-trail action while waiting for your teams to kick. Try Kansas State at Texas to start (noon, FS1), Washington State at Arizona in the afternoon flight (4 p.m., P12N), and Western Kentucky at no. 5 LSU in prime time (7 p.m., ESPNU) for maximum eccentricity potential. It could be a game-winning safety from Bill Snyder’s boys. It could be Les Miles removing his signature hat to reveal a smaller Les Miles standing atop his head who has been calling the plays this whole time. You never know. You just never know. What you do know: #Pac12AfterDark comes through again with a pair of nightcaps. Colorado at Oregon State (10:30 p.m., P12N) shares a slot with Washington at no. 10 Stanford (10:30 p.m., ESPN).  Are you Stephenville–era Art Briles? Do you feel like a winner? Go on, now. Get out there. This column has been updated to correct a photo caption; the Texas A&M quarterback pictured is Kyle Allen, not Kyler Murray.",2015-10-22T08:35:40+00:00,College Football,Anderson
11,"College Football Preview, Week 7: That’s a Good Way to Break an Axle","This is one of those weird weeks where we’re putting up a viewing guide after a game has already been played: Arkansas State beat South Alabama on Tuesday night in Mobile, 49-31. You can watch the whole thing on your phone if you missed it. The Red Wolves scored 29 points in the fourth quarter, twice on offense and then twice on defense. It was, in other words, exactly the sort of thing one wants out of a Tuesday prime-time football contest. The good news: The balance of Week 7 brings a headliner binge the likes of which we haven’t seen all year, beginning with a Thursday-night game between top-20 Pac-12 programs. From an entertainment-intake perspective, this is the sporting equivalent of listening to an entire DragonForce album at the same time. Here, try it:  Top 25 Matchups: Five of ’em! The aforementioned opening act is no. 18 UCLA at no. 15 Stanford (10:30 p.m. Thursday, ESPN). The other four are spaced fairly evenly over Saturday, starting with no. 17 Iowa at no. 20 Northwestern (noon, ABC/ESPN2), continuing with a double feature of no. 10 Alabama at no. 9 Texas A&M (3:30 p.m., CBS) and no. 7 Michigan State at no. 12 Michigan (3:30 p.m., ESPN), and concluding with the annual can’t-miss batshit-bonkers tilt of no. 8 Florida at no. 6 LSU (7 p.m., ESPN). Brothers and sisters, we are blessed to the gills. How High Are the Week 7 Stakes? High as a foil-wrapped tamale thrown up in the air and hit from the top row of Death Valley into the roiling mass of purple-and-gold humanity below, using another foil-wrapped tamale as an improvised bat; no, that example doesn’t seem weirdly specific; no, you are being evasive. Undercards of Interest: It’s a mark of the quality of the weekend that Penn State at no. 1 Ohio State (8 p.m., ABC) is this far down the list. Same with West Virginia at no. 2 Baylor (noon, Fox). The Bears and Mountaineers have met three times in program history; the lowest-scoring game of the series ended 41-27. Also of note: No. 19 Oklahoma travels to Kansas State (3:30 p.m., ABC), where the Wertherscraft magic of Bill Snyder will somehow engineer a close game despite having lost thirty-eleven quarterbacks in the space of half a season. Rivalry Game of the Week: Air Force at Colorado State (3:30 p.m., CBSSN), for the honor of hosting the RAM-FALCON TROPHY. Look, it’s not the most glorious totem to gaze upon. But it’s a ram and a falcon fused together in metal, and its name carries a blunt elegance. The foundation is there for some real Lovecraftian horror. Grudge Match of the Week: No. 13 Ole Miss at Memphis (noon, ABC/ESPN2). Oxford and Memphis are separated by a 90-minute drive. Mississippi head coach Hugh Freeze has ties to both cities. Memphis hasn’t notched a win in this on-again, off-again series since 2004, got beat 24-3 in Oxford last season, and comes in undefeated but facing a precipitous uptick in competition. By all rights, this game should kick off no earlier than 9 p.m. and be lit only by bursts of illegal fireworks. Games Featuring Head Coaches Who Were Not Head Coaches This Time Last Thursday: Been a week, hasn’t it? Remember when Tim Beckman got fired? How many scandals ago was that, now? Anyway: Vanderbilt at South Carolina (4 p.m., SECN) will see the debut of Shawn Elliott, stepping in for the retiring Steve Spurrier. USC at no. 14 Notre Dame (7:30 p.m., NBC) will feature the return of Clay Helton, who served in an interim-interim capacity for the Trojans’ 2013 Las Vegas Bowl appearance following the firing of Lane Kiffin and the departure of Ed Orgeron. Frequently Asked Questions How many undefeated bids could come crashing down this weekend? There are 15 and-oh teams on the schedule in Week 7; as many as 14 of those could come undone, if you’re willing to entertain a universe in which Toledo is upset by Eastern Michigan. The only game featuring two unbeaten programs is Florida-LSU. How many teams could get their first win this weekend? The winless well is dwindling, but none of the five squads on the slate has a particularly favorable matchup; the most closely matched game is probably 3-3 Nevada at 0-6 Wyoming. Is there a crueler league to teams on a skid than the Big 12? There is not. This week, the Kansas Jayhawks (0-5) must face the blazing guns of Texas Tech (4-2), with the Red Raiders coming in averaging almost 53 points per contest. It’s not even funny.  Thursday: WEEKNIGHT GAME OF IMPORT SIREN. THURSDAY-NIGHT SEC GAME SIREN. THESE ARE NOT THE SAME GAMES SIREN. Auburn at Kentucky (7 p.m., ESPN) and Western Kentucky at North Texas (7:30 p.m., CBSSN) are both on, but this week you can afford to wait for the good stuff, in the form of the no. 18 UCLA at no. 15 Stanford kick at 10:30 p.m. (ESPN). Friday: Some potentially entertaining sleeper hit games here, with an hour buffer in between that will allow you to sample both Cincinnati at BYU (8 p.m., ESPN) and no. 21 Boise State at Utah State (9 p.m., CBSSN). Saturday: Lordamercy, where to begin. Tripleheaders lurk in all three main flights of games, and that’s just if you’re watching the headliners. First up: West Virginia at no. 2 Baylor (noon, Fox), no. 17 Iowa at no. 20 Northwestern (noon, ABC/ESPN2), and no. 13 Ole Miss at Memphis (noon, ABC/ESPN2). Midafternoon brings no. 10 Alabama at no. 9 Texas A&M (3:30 p.m., CBS), no. 19 Oklahoma at Kansas State (3:30 p.m., ABC), and no. 7 Michigan State at no. 12 Michigan (3:30 p.m., ESPN). In prime time, no. 8 Florida at no. 6 LSU (7 p.m., ESPN) is accompanied by USC at no. 14 Notre Dame (7:30 p.m., NBC) and Penn State at no. 1 Ohio State (8 p.m., ABC). All of that and a double Pac-12 nightcap of Arizona State at no. 4 Utah (10 p.m., ESPN) and Oregon at Washington (10:30 p.m., ESPN2).

12,College Football Week 5 Preview: Welcome to October,"The great news is, if you’re reading this, you made it through the dregs of that dreadful September slate and into the best month of the college football season. The bad news is, your life doesn’t belong to you anymore. Are you hydrated? It’s too late to find out any way but the hard way.  But what’s that sound? Is it things getting real? Is it your team’s veiled flaws creeping up behind you? In the form of a dead-eyed shambling figure in a hospital gown? Surely not. Surely it’s the wind. (All times Eastern.) Top 25 Matchups: FIVE, only three of which overlap almost entirely, so … progress? Of a sort? No. 23 West Virginia at no. 15 Oklahoma gooses the schedule early with an abominable pre-noon local-time kickoff in Norman (noon, FS1) and the Mountaineers secondary’s first real road test against a high-powered passing attack. In the midafternoon slate, we have no. 13 Alabama at no. 8 Georgia (3:30 p.m., CBS), pitting Dawgs DC Jeremy Pruitt against his former Sith master Nick Saban. In prime time, grab a second screen or a third remote and prepare to have your attentions divided between no. 3 Ole Miss at no. 25 Florida (7 p.m., ESPN, just let the defensive lines fight it out with padded swords and save everybody else the hassle), no. 21 Mississippi State at no. 14 Texas A&M (7:30 p.m., SECN, why after playing both Auburn and LSU does this still feel like our first good look at MSU?), and no. 6 Notre Dame at no. 12 Clemson (8 p.m., ABC, feels like a cratering loss on somebody’s part but no idea whose). How High Are the Week 5 Stakes? High as the special-effects budget for an unnecessary tightrope movie that was already a perfectly serviceable documentary? Which is to say, somebody’s definitely getting a whole bunch of security guards fired at all five of the above contests. Destination Game of the Week: Athens. The last time Georgia and Alabama met during the regular season, the game produced the most succinctly elegant piece of sportswriting ever constructed; take it away, Dan Wetzel’s description of what Saban’s like after a 41-30 Tide win: There even were conflicting reports that he smiled in the victorious locker room. “Yes, he smiled and told us he loved us,” Reamer said. “No,” said cornerback Javier Arenas. “Maybe,” laughed quarterback John Parker Wilson. “I’m excited,” said Saban, looking not the least bit excited. This year’s iteration promises to be great people-watching; not only does it pit two of the best tailgating fan bases in the country, but they’re also both crowds that take losses very, very personally. Undercards of Import: Large chunks of the Big Ten that you might not have gotten to see this season will be featured in a series of conference matchups, beginning with a Minnesota squad that lost to TCU by six in Week 1 at undefeated no. 16 Northwestern (noon, BTN), and 4-0 Iowa at no. 19 Wisconsin, which lost its season opener to Alabama (noon, ESPN). The agenda item of greatest interest here lurks in the afternoon slate, when no. 1 Ohio State visits a 4-0 Indiana team whose best win is over Western Kentucky (3:30 p.m., ABC/ESPN2). More of the same in the Big 12: Texas Tech at no. 5 Baylor will see the Red Raiders coming off a stinging field-goal-margin loss to TCU, and the Bears playing their first Power 5 game of the season (3:30 p.m., ABC/ESPN2), followed by 3-0 Kansas State at 4-0 no. 20 Oklahoma State (4 p.m., FS1). Profiles in Profiteroles: Houston and Tulsa are two of four teams that look prepared to challenge Memphis and Navy for first place in the AAC West, but first they’ve got to play each other (noon, CBSSN). Your #MACtion of the week is in Muncie, where a Toledo team with wins over Arkansas and Iowa State visits a Ball State team that just lost at Northwestern by five (3 p.m., ESPN3). Rivalry Games of the Week: Hard to imagine any team but the Mids snagging the Commander-in-Chief’s Trophy come December, but they make ’em play anyway, starting with Air Force at Navy (3:30 p.m., CBSSN). There’s also a brand-new trophy game in the offing later that evening, in the form of South Alabama at Troy and a BIG DAMN BELT (7 p.m., ESPN3). But we all know what time it is. Brothers and sisters, it’s Fremont Cannon time.  UNLV at Nevada kicks off at 7 p.m. on the Mountain West Network. Grudge Match of the Week: San Jose State at Auburn (4 p.m., SECN). It’s not so much that this game itself is a rivalry between the schools — the Tigers beat the Spartans 59-13 last season in the teams’ first meeting — as it is SJSU tailback Tyler Ervin appearing to harbor a particular and personal antipathy for opposing ground defenses. He recorded a perfect 300 rushing yards versus Fresno State last weekend and will take the field on the Plains facing a team allowing opponents 5.31 yards per carry. This Week in Why? We’re still, as a society, apparently letting Missouri play football after what happened against Connecticut. Same goes for South Carolina after what happened in every single one of its games this season, which goes to show that if anything, we don’t have ENOUGH governmental red tape in this great nation. (Gamecocks at Tigers, noon, SECN.) This Week in Why Not? Arkansas at Tennessee (7 p.m., ESPN2), because haven’t you always wanted to put a homemade science project volcano in the crockpot? Thursday: Miami at Cincinnati (7:30 p.m., ESPN). I was fully prepared to call for a boycott of this game in protest of the Canes doing away with their cuneiform unis, but what, like you’re gonna watch Ravens-Steelers? Friday: Three games, none of which looks particularly competitive on paper, beginning with Temple at Charlotte (7 p.m., CBSSN) and Memphis at South Florida (7 p.m., ESPN2), then ending with UConn at BYU (10:15 p.m., ESPN2). Saturday: Call this a chalk weekend, with maybe just a little too much going on to do more than cursorily glance at your auxiliary rooting interests. The course you set for yourselves will be a simple one; it’s the volume that offers the challenge. No. 23 West Virginia at no. 15 Oklahoma (noon, FS1) is first up, and everybody else in the first flight who’s ranked has an unranked opponent, but of the choices, Texas at no. 4 TCU looks the most like it might offer some events of interest (noon, ABC). In the second flight, our server advises dividing your time between no. 13 Alabama at no. 8 Georgia (3:30 p.m., CBS) and Texas Tech at no. 5 Baylor (3:30 p.m., ABC/ESPN2), with ample peeks at no. 1 Ohio State at Indiana (3:30 p.m., ABC/ESPN2) and K-State at no. 20 OSU (4 p.m., FS1). Taper off slightly for the evening flight with no. 21 Mississippi State at no. 14 Texas A&M (7:30 p.m., SECN), adding in no. 6 Notre Dame at no. 12 Clemson (8 p.m., ABC) after the first quarter or so. Your nightcap: Arizona at no. 18 Stanford (10:30 p.m., P12N). Your lullaby: ",2015-10-01T10:05:24+00:00,College Football,Anderson
13,State of the Bluegrass: When Will Kentucky Football Finally Turn It Around?,"The heat has broken in Lexington; the humidity has not, and there’s just a touch of violence in the air. Toward the end of the season, this kind of day would produce a nasty squall; in mid-September, there is only the sense that the winds and spitting rain could turn furious at any moment, if they could just get blowing in the same direction. The storm holds off, and the afternoon clouds and the walls of the freshly renovated Commonwealth Stadium take on the exact same pale gray cast. A sellout crowd is rolling in for the Kentucky-Florida game, undeterred by the threat of ill weather. There are more than a few basketball jerseys on display — you’d think Rajon Rondo were a former wide receiver — but most notable are the blue-and-white, game-specific GATOR HATER NATION T-shirts. A few years ago they would have felt like an overreach. Now they stand out. Since a 1986 10-3 UK win in Lexington, Kentucky has lost 29 consecutive games to Florida, and any data set that large is bound to contain multitudes. There was the 1993 24-20 game, the year the Bill Curry–coached Cats had the temerity to come within a touchdown of Steve Spurrier’s Gators, which the Head Ball Coach followed up, as has often been his wont, by napalming the Wildcats, 73-7, the following year in Gainesville. This was followed by the worst shutout of the series, 65-0, in the Swamp two years later. And there was last year’s contest, a triple-overtime 36-30 affair featuring a very, very close no-call by the officiating crew. The 2015 meeting will eventually become just another plot point on a long dotted line, almost entirely unremarkable — except for its historical context. This wasn’t the closest loss, but it was a chance to avenge one of the most deeply bitter defeats the Wildcats have suffered courtesy of the Gators. A win this year would’ve been a particularly poetic time to snap that streak. And give the Wildcats this much: For a team fast approaching its third decade of abuse at the hands of a single opponent, victory never appeared to be all that far out of reach. But a 14-9 contest, won by not the best Gators squad to ever take the field, lost by not the worst Wildcats side, will soon be consigned to the particularly roomy dustbin of history that is the nation’s longest active streak of futility. It’s a bitter disappointment, but by Monday morning, head coach Mark Stoops has moved on enough to get a little philosophical. “I think what encouraged us is we didn’t play our best and we were in a one-possession game against Florida. I take nothing away from them; I think they had a lot to do with that, especially defensively. We’re not there yet. We are not good enough to not play our best. Against anyone. We know we have to scratch and claw, or we won’t win.” ??? It is flatly impossible to foresee a time in which Kentucky football will ever enjoy natural advantages in the East. The state isn’t densely populated enough to reliably produce rich harvests of homegrown talent — and must elbow for oxygen with division-mates (Florida and Georgia) that can cultivate their own native blue-chip prospects and boast more storied programs with sustained histories of success. Even while weathering a coaching change, the Gators won’t stay down long with all that talent on defense, and Tennessee’s entire roster won’t stay 19 years old forever. There’s not a great big window here in which Kentucky can clamor for relevance — but with Florida, Missouri, Tennessee, and South Carolina all in various states of upheaval, there is some breathing room. “Big picture, I feel very good about where we’re at,” says Stoops. “Maybe not with wins and losses, but with the environment. Two sellouts in a row. The stadium’s done. We’re building a hundred-thousand-square-foot football complex that we raised the money for. We’ve had two very good recruiting classes. You put all that together and I feel ahead of schedule.” There’s a new Wildcat identity taking shape in Lexington. Having trouble pulling all the kids you need out of the states to the south? Why not look to the north, into the talent-richer lands across the Ohio River? From a recruiting standpoint, the choice of Stoops has seemed like something of a no-brainer since his hiring in November 2012. You can’t buy or manufacture the kind of taproot ties the Stoops family has to Ohio, and with recruiting coordinator and fellow Youngstown native Vince Marrow, the Kentucky roster now holds 21 players from the Buckeye State, most of them underclassmen. Breaking down players by home state is no cure-all, but it feels like something worth noting, because for the first time in a really, really, really long time, there’s something recognizable about Kentucky football. There are key players plucked from SEC territory — sophomore running back Boom Williams, sophomore defensive tackle Regie Meant, redshirt freshman defensive end Denzil Ware — who could conceivably form the bedrock of a team capable of competing in the conference. And there’s no such thing as a cakewalk schedule in this league, but UK does get eight home games this season and a draw out of the West (Auburn and Mississippi State) that could be a lot worse. It’s not fair to expect the Wildcats to be all that ready to seize divisional power, but it’s also very fair to say that this year gives them the best possible shot to jump up a couple rungs in the standings. Because the current state of the SEC East, which might charitably be called “kinda assy,” could work to the Wildcats’ advantage. Since Florida’s last national title season in 2008, the West has taken every SEC championship game, alternating wins between Alabama and Auburn, with LSU helpfully putting in a 2011 appearance to break up the monotony. It is the West, now, that devours itself alive, while the East simmers in the background. Andy Lyons/Getty Images Patrick Towles of the Wildcats passes the ball against the Florida Gators. But since the league split in ’92, UK has enjoyed the double disservice of (a) playing a conference schedule that’s usually somewhat front-loaded, with Florida always coming early, and (b) not being very good most of the time. If the question is, “What’s the closest Kentucky has ever come to winning an SEC East title?” the answer is, “Probably 1993 or ’99.” If, however, the question is, “Has Kentucky ever been a factor in the SEC East race into November?” the answer is, “Unless you were seriously entertaining the possibility of some kind of superflu or other targeted bioweapon taking out Athens, Knoxville, Gainesville, and both Columbias simultaneously, while in the process sparing Lexington, no.” That could change with concentration, execution, recruiting, and luck — or that window could slam shut again, for who knows how long this time. ??? Stoops himself will hear none of this hopeful talk. He doesn’t want to discuss this season’s chances at reaching a bowl game for the first time since 2010, nor does he want to consider next season and watching his first recruiting class of significance hit its junior year. “The challenge comes in when you’ve got to play on such an edge all the time,” he says. “We’ve got to find that balance of being able to go out and play with that hair-on-fire mentality, but also a calmness about us. We won some games in our first two years playing on energy alone, and that’s just not going to get it done consistently.” Stoops won’t even go so far as to set a “would be nice” benchmark for the 2015 win-loss column. “I’ve really been reluctant to put an number on that,” says Stoops. “Because if I say a realistic goal is six games, then what am I telling my team? That I’m conceding six games? We’re good enough to beat most teams on our schedule, if not all. But we’re not good enough to not play well and beat anybody.” Just a handful of beaten somebodies would do, for a start. So far this season in the SEC East, only Georgia appears to be fielding a quorum of working parts of a football team. Florida made its own share of misfires against Kentucky. Two-time defending division champ Missouri currently boasts one of the worst offenses in the country. South Carolina is already two conference games in the hole, edged out by the Wildcats in Columbia and outright thrashed in Athens — and September’s not even over yet. Tennessee is studiously trying to recall what winning signature games feels like; and it is best, as customary, not to speak of Vanderbilt. So. Who all feels like racing the Bulldogs for the next couple years to grab that ring? It’s an open question. And we’ll know whether the answer is “Kentucky” all too soon.",2015-09-25T09:38:45+00:00,College Football,Anderson
14,College Football Week 3 Wrap: 10 Takeaways From the Weekend That Was,"First, a formal apology for the recommendation that you skip the early games this past weekend in favor of human contact, errands, and the marquee games later in the day. If this suggestion caused anybody to miss out on the runaway mine-cart ride that was UConn-Missouri, you probably had a little less fun than your wire-to-wire-watching pals, but you’ll also probably live longer. Fair trade-off? Because fans who began their Saturdays with the nooners and hung in for the end of Pac-12 play are lucky to be able to process human language on a screen today. The piñata of college football1 broke wide open in Week 3, a slate so overstuffed with action that even the undercard results could fill their own highlight reel. There’s a lollipop here (Colorado knocking off Colorado State in Denver!), some gummy worms over there (Kansas State being taken to triple overtime by Louisiana Tech!), a stray candy bar underfoot (whatever the hell got into Miami late against Nebraska!). And will you look at that? An apple just bounced off a crimson helmet and right into your hands, and it broke open, and it’s full of spiders.  Anyway: You shot 90 pounds of football this weekend, but are able to carry only 40 back to the wagon. Below, a lovingly crafted batch of topics to mull as we head into the final round of September games. There really was a 5-min span where Iowa hit a 57-yard FG, Texas missed a game-tying PAT, and Ole Miss hit the flukiest no-no-YES TD ever. — Bill Connelly (@SBN_BillC) September 20, 2015  1. One, Mississippi. There are plenty of chances between now and December for Ole Miss to be laid low. It is fair to be curious how their offense will bear up against the Gators’ defensive front in a couple of weeks. It is fair to wonder how the ground game will look if the Rebels are forced to run for significant chunks of a contest. It is fair2 to speculate whether their quarterback is being pursued by international agencies in connection with an underground wildlife circus that stages fights featuring endangered owls. But here, at this very moment, the Rebels are the class of the SEC West. They beat Alabama in Oxford a year ago only to watch the Tide make the playoff anyway after three regular-season losses knocked the Rebs out of contention — but nothing can take away Ole Miss’s first win in Tuscaloosa since 1988 and its first back-to-back wins against Alabama in program history, or erase the memory of this unassailable play-of-the-year front-runner: Isn’t it fun when it looks like the football is also having fun? The Tide had earned the right, over the years, to feel like they should win this game — and they had some poor luck to go along with their poor execution this weekend. But this is why they play the games, and nights like Saturday night are why we stay awake for all of them. 2. Don’t look now, but Notre Dame looks like it has zombie strength. The Baader-Meinhof phenomenon is the sensation of “frequency illusion,” in which once something has caught your attention, you start to notice it everywhere. On the one hand, season-ending injuries are a sad and constant reality of this sport. On the other, it feels like we’re noticing blows to the Fighting Irish roster because they’re happening all the time. Notre Dame was down five starters before welcoming Georgia Tech for what was supposed to be a hard-fought game, put on a remarkable show to beat the Yellow Jackets in South Bend, and in the process lost a starting safety to an ACL tear sustained while celebrating a defended pass. And it doesn’t get remotely easier from here: After a brief respite at home against UMass in Week 4, the Irish embark on an October schedule that involves trips to Clemson and Temple and visits from Navy and USC. 3-4. The Pac-12 North looks pretty open; the South, not so much. For those of you scoring at home, Stanford has a win over USC, and USC — ranked no. 6 in Week 3 — has what could be a long, long season in front of it, including road games at Arizona State, Notre Dame, Oregon, and … Cal. Right. Cal! The Golden Bears were happy to benefit from Week 3’s second-most-soul-eviscerating finish. New quarterback Jerrod Heard of Texas personally recorded 527 yards of offense, culminating in a 45-yard scoring run that was capped off thusly:  So it was that the fourth quarter in Austin began 45-24, and ended 45-44, and so began our irresponsible speculation on the possibility of a North champion other than the Ducks or Cardinal. It’s way too early to discount Oregon, which has just one loss to what looks like a rugged Michigan State team. And given the stats Stanford put up against the Wildcats and Trojans, it’s hard to know what to make of the team from Palo Alto this early. But it’s starting to feel like a three-team race for the 2015 division title is at least plausible, right? Or at least fun to think about? Meanwhile, in the South: Why, yes, that was 2014 Triangle All-Star Myles Jack snapping Tanner Mangum’s game-breaking touchdown streak. Jack’s heroics followed a rally by the Bruins’ ground game to edge out BYU, one that made UCLA look very much like a team capable of supporting its still-fledgling freshman quarterback even when he acts like a guy playing his first season of college ball. 5. Auburn’s magic is GONE. Whatever trickster god gifted the viewing public with the Prayer at Jordan-Hare and the Kick-Six game has not been given enough baby goats’ blood, and it’s starting to show. It feels mildly disrespectful to even make the Auburn Tigers the protagonists of this section, when the LSU Tigers they were playing on Saturday were fielding Leonard Fournette. Everything that happened in Baton Rouge feels like it should be discussed relative to wherever Fournette was while it was happening. This is our new heliocentrism, and this Bayou Bengal is the surly sun:  If and when this Will Muschamp defense jells to the point where it can handle youth and injuries, we may look back at this moment with more kindness, but you don’t often see guys running this way even against a lower-division team. Overmatched competition is one thing, but Fournette’s out there atomizing defenders. That kind of thing doesn’t just happen in a vacuum, although tackling him appears to be as futile as trying to breathe in deep space. LEONARD FOURNETTE ????????????????????????????????????????????? — Andrew Sharp (@andrewsharp) September 19, 2015  (Because you’re about to go and look: LSU plays at Ole Miss the week before Thanksgiving, November 21.) 6. Georgia, at least, appears to have its feet set. While the SEC West was off ravaging itself, the Bulldogs were setting an NCAA accuracy record with their much-maligned transfer quarterback. Sure, why not? And doing it against Steve Spurrier’s South Carolina team, a team he has used in the past as his proxy in the continuation of the Cocktail Party rivalry, to Georgia’s frequent dismay? Why not! 7. It could get so much worse for Arkansas before it gets the tiniest bit better. Call this Spiteration Saturday, when Kliff Kingsbury will see your disdain for Texas spread teams and raise you a strip of your own hide. If the Red Raiders’ head coach had a mane, he would’ve tossed it here. If he had a crest of feathers, they’d be standing straight up and rustling. Oh, and Arkansas goes into Texas next week, to play A&M in Arlington. Jerry Jones is gonna put scorpions in all the visiting lockers and it won’t do him a dang bit of good. Just a note, Bert: if Kliff's mad, Kevin's mad. — Mark Passwaters (@mbpRivals) September 20, 2015  8. The American gets more and more exciting every week. To the previously lauded efforts of Temple and Memphis, let’s add two offshoots of the Stephenville High coaching tree: Chad Morris’s SMU, who hung better against TCU than the Mustangs did against Baylor in their opener, and Philip Montgomery’s Tulsa Golden Hurricane, who never stopped chasing Oklahoma. Could you imagine, back in August, being this excited for AAC league play to get underway in earnest? 9. This can’t pass without another mention. The time has come for a robust national discussion regarding WHAT IN THE HELL, MISSOURI AND CONNECTICUT. Have you ever seen a 9-6 game that took this kind of circuitous route to get there? ""is he covered? Is he still covered? Is he stilllll covered? Alright let's do this."" pic.twitter.com/u1QFzdcvDC — OHB (@ohholybutt) September 19, 2015  Have you ever been more sure, after witnessing a deadly interception, that the team committing that turnover was going to go on to win its division for some outlandish reason that human calculating can’t even conceive of yet? Missouri to Atlanta. We’ll figure out why in December. 10. We are all of us in for something marvelous. September college football and November college football are entirely different breeds of fun. In November it’s all about stakes, but in September it’s mostly about mistakes, teams learning who they are and what they’re capable of, and serving as an especially potent reminder of what sets this sport apart from the NFL: It’s so much more human. Not having the foggiest clue what form a given team might take isn’t frustrating at all, as long as you’re not making your living as an oddsmaker. Rather, it frees you to imagine anything, without tangible floors or ceilings for any team. Alabama doesn’t have a quarterback and September’s almost over! Ohio State has three of the best on its roster and turned the ball over five times against Northern Illinois! Three weeks in, it looks like we’re headed for the very best kind of year there is in the game: The one when absolutely everybody looks beatable. But time enough for that next week. Get ready to kick the hell out of this anthill again in a week or so. For now, the mission is threefold: rehab, vengeance, and what have you. ",2015-09-21T09:27:35+00:00,College Football,Anderson
15,Volunteer Work: Tennessee Football and the Devils You Know,"No. 19 Oklahoma 31, no. 23 Tennessee 24. Seems appropriate, doesn’t it? And it is. If you were taking a casual glance across the Week 2 scoreboard, it would scan without a hiccup. The 19th-best team in the country visited the 23rd, played a close game, and pulled out a win in double overtime. All very tidy. In Knoxville, however, where there’s always one weary eye on the past and one wary eye on the future when it comes to the football program, the result of the Volunteers’ tilt with the Sooners is fraught with meaning. Another young Tennessee squad, hacking its way through another front-loaded schedule, fell short of putting together 60 minutes of coherent football. A team that has seemed by turns snakebit and inordinately fond of wading around in snake pits now must absorb another stinging loss. OU 31, UT 24 is just the latest variation on a well-worn theme of what if. What if the Vols hadn’t sat quite so stolidly on that 17-0 lead they built in the first half? What if they’d been more adept at on-field adjustments? What if their penalty discipline, which served them so well in 2014, hadn’t collapsed? None of these are new laments. But even by Tennessee’s stratospheric standards for close-call heartbreak, this one had to smart. Allowing the biggest comeback at home in school history will do that. ??? Jackson Laizure/Getty Images Wide receiver Sterling Shepard of the Oklahoma Sooners jumps over safety Brian Randolph of the Tennessee Volunteers. To hear longtimers tell it, Neyland Stadium was louder on the evening of September 12 than it had been in years, the jovial rancor of more than a hundred thousand hollering throats vibrating skulls. For a half or so of football, it had reason to be. Baker Mayfield’s first pass for Oklahoma fell incomplete, closely defended by Brian Randolph. Samaje Perine broke off an 11-yard run on second down; Mayfield hit Dede Westbrook with a 16-yard pass, and the Sooners were bounding down the field — and that’s right about the time Mayfield’s next pass bounced into the hands of Tennessee’s Todd Kelly Jr. and the noise went supernova. And then, three minutes after that, the first what-if: On third-and-goal, inside the 1-yard line, the Vols ran diminutive tailback Alvin Kamara for no gain, then backed up and kicked a field goal — and the crowd recoiled, just a little. It was impossible to help wondering whether that decision to forgo trying for six points might not be important later on. And, of course, it was. In his postgame press conference, Vols coach Butch Jones defended his decision. “Football’s a game of momentum. … You don’t want all-or-nothing plays at the beginning of the game. We just felt we needed to get on the board, get some confidence, and get some points.” While nobody knows Jones’s team better than he does, it’s hard to imagine what more momentum and confidence a team could wish for, with an opening-drive turnover and a rapid march into enemy territory, and 102,000 or so clamoring fans behind them. On Monday, Jones expounded on his initial explanation, saying, “We do everything based on analytics, so nothing is taken by chance. Probably about four or five hours went into that single decision. … You can always second guess, but I don’t second guess because a lot of diligence and effort went into that decision.”1 Jones also pointed out that had the Vols made a game-saving stop late, or scored just one more time, nobody would be talking about the first-quarter field goal. And that’s true enough: Tennessee did, for a stretch, hold that 17-0 lead. In the second half, however, the youth of the Volunteers reasserted itself. 2014’s sixth-least-penalized team in the country would end up flagged 10 times for a loss of 80 yards. The offense took on the plodding quality of a kicked mule. The defense had few answers for the late-game highlight-reel heroics of Mayfield and receiver Sterling Shepard. Oklahoma kicked and scratched and bit with increasing furor the longer Tennessee tried to drown it in a puddle; on one emblematic play in the fourth quarter, at least five orange jerseys missed Mayfield in the backfield on a play on which Tennessee’s defense was also penalized 10 yards. It was dispiriting all around. “I told them,” said Jones on Saturday night, “‘Don’t ever lose this feeling. When there’s a day you don’t feel like coming to practice or you don’t feel like working hard, think about how you feel right now.’” It’s advice the staff would do well to absorb. We speak and think of players and coaches both as institutions. They’re set up by their schools, their fans, and the media as avatars of the program, until it’s almost cognitively dissonant to see them act like people. They’re praised or pilloried in the abstract, to a point where it’s easy to forget that, no, there’s no such thing as just deciding not to be affected by adverse circumstances. But the team won’t believe it’s out of the well dug by late-stage Phillip Fulmer, Lane Kiffin, and Derek Dooley until it’s in full daylight. To do that, it needs to get wins. To do that, some boldness will be called for. And it’d help if they had some luck. There is a way forward here: The SEC East is in flux, and it hasn’t produced a conference champion since 2008. The two biggest games on Tennessee’s schedule, at home versus no. 7 Georgia and away at no. 2 Alabama, sit squarely in the middle of October, separated by a bye week. Between here and there is a trip to see a Florida team that’s breaking in a new head coach and a home game against an Arkansas squad that just lost to Toledo. The pieces of this program are still so young, still erratic, but what might they look like with some actual win-loss momentum behind them? Last season’s bunch, overrun with 18-year-olds, found the going slow and painful in Norman. This season’s iteration, replete with 19-year-olds, has made a clear stride. Good enough to roar early, if not enough to endure late. It’s not a bad plateau to be on, but it’s also not an acceptable destination, not in this town, not in this league. Since the signing of Jones’s splashy 2014 class, 2016 has been pointed to as the year to look out for, the year that the bumper crop of blue-chippers enters its junior season. But if they can’t figure out how to win games they ought to — and games they ought not — as sophomores, it might not even matter. Because here’s the thing: The closer the Vols get to contending, the more these losses are going to hurt. There has to be a chance for it to hurt this bad. Tennessee football, when Jones was hired as its fourth head coach in six years, had what amounted to a third-degree burn of a program — charred and extensively damaged, but at least it didn’t feel anything. Healing itches. It stings. And the losses are going to rankle, worse and worse, until the Vols can turn that feeling around on somebody else’s team.",2015-09-16T13:35:22+00:00,College Football,Anderson
16,"College Football Week 2 Preview: Angry Ducks, Boots With Bees, and a Hawaiian Nightmare","Wasn’t that fun? Nice little opening week, with a high entertainment yield for such a bland-looking slate. Keep that in mind when perusing the schedule for Week 2, still overrun with FBS teams laying waste to smaller in-state programs, thrashing around like toddler hydras not yet big and strong enough to cross borders. Plus: triple the volume of top-25 tilts as last week! Brothers and sisters, let’s dance. (All times Eastern.) Top 25 Matchups: Three; two nonconference Power 5 rematches and one early division rivalry game. No. 7 Oregon at no. 5 Michigan State is the headliner (8 p.m. Saturday, Pac-12), picking up from last season in Eugene, where the Spartans gave the Ducks hell for a half but didn’t adjust to keep up later in the game. No. 14 LSU at no. 25 Mississippi State (9:15 p.m. Saturday, ESPN) offers this season’s first substantial look at the Bayou Bengals, following last week’s rained-out game against McNeese State, and since the Bulldogs played Southern Miss last week, probably your first look at Dak Prescott this season, as well. No. 19 Oklahoma at no. 23 Tennessee (6 p.m. Saturday, ESPN) is the back half of a home-and-home series1 matching up the country’s two most readily weaponized fight songs. How High Are the Week 2 Stakes? About as high as a toddler ascending a bookcase while its guardian’s back is turned for no more than two minutes. The silence should’ve warned you something was happening. Rivalry Games of the Week: It’s the Schnelly Bowl! Miami plays Florida Atlantic in Boca Raton on Friday night (8 p.m., FS1), and Howard Schnellenberger, coach of the 1983 national champion Hurricanes and first coach of the Owls, will be on hand for the coin flip and hundreds of photogenic moments. Also on Friday night, in Salt Lake City, Utah State and no. 24 Regular Utah will meet in what’s currently the last scheduled installment of the Battle of the Brothers rivalry. This is a troubling development due to its potential to deteriorate the Beehive Boot rivalry, an old shoe passed around among Utah football teams that may or may not be filled with live bees.2 And in Ames, the Iowa–Iowa State Cy-Hawk Series resumes; nowhere else in Week 2 will you find this many plush costumes of birds featuring beaks inexplicably filled with human teeth (4:45 p.m. Saturday, Fox). Once and Future Grudge Matches: Kentucky and South Carolina (7:30 p.m. Saturday, SECN) are division rivals that, like most SEC East combatants, never seem to register too high on the hate barometer, but after the Wildcats’ upset performance last year in Lexington, is it too much to hope for some vintage visor-flinging from Steve Spurrier? And if you’re Georgia Southern’s Willie Fritz, and your team’s still dusting itself off from a Morgantown faceplant, how not enthused are you to see a Western Michigan team that played Michigan State tough in Week 1 rolling into town? WMU coach and noted madman P.J. Fleck could annex the student section by halftime and declare it a sovereign colony of Kalamazoo. You never know what that guy’s gonna be capable of. This Week in Why? That 11:30 a.m. kickoff for USF and no. 11 FSU (ESPN) is assuming so, so much about the collective abilities of college students in general, and Tampa and Tallahassee residents in particular, to not be hungover and to be anywhere before noon on a Saturday. And did anybody notice this curious symmetry later in the day? RichRod and Jim-El Mora are running guns across the border to Canada. That’s the only acceptable explanation for these road trips. You laugh all you want. They’d be GREAT at it. Potential Upset with Bizarrely Compelling Consequences: Florida International travels to Indiana on Saturday (8 p.m., BTN) for a game in which the Hoosiers are favored by about a touchdown. Consider this scenario: What if the moxie the Golden Panthers picked up by beating Central Florida last week and the doldrums lingering around Bloomington from an agonizingly close call versus Southern Illinois combine in such a way as to create a ripe atmosphere for a second consecutive FIU victory over a much larger opponent? And if you wanna get real, real sick, what if Louisiana Tech upsets Kansas State in Week 3, setting up a clash between UNDEFEATED RON TURNER and UNDEFEATED SKIP HOLTZ in Week 4? This is the prognostication equivalent of scratching at a scab that is in no way ready to come off the skin, and about as advisable, and just as hard to stop doing. Ronald Martinez/Getty Images Thursday: For the grisly scenario above to unfold as planned, the Bulldogs first have to get past the Hilltoppers. Louisiana Tech at Western Kentucky is your only nationally televised game on offer this evening (8 p.m., FS1). Friday: Alternate between the Schnellymania on FS1 (Miami at FAU, 8 p.m.) and Chuckie Keeton3 on ESPN2 (Utah State at no. 24 Utah, 9 p.m.). Saturday: There’s a modest but appealing spread of early games that aren’t headliners but could get interesting in some specific way, which should be more than enough to tide you over until all three top-25 games kick off in the evening. In the first flight: Kansas State travels to the Alamodome to face UTSA without its starting quarterback (noon, FS1); a Bowling Green team stinging from a hard-fought loss to Tennessee romps into Maryland (noon, BTN); and freshly minted head coach Tom Herman takes Houston to Louisville (noon, ESPN3). In the most ludicrously lengthy road trip you’re likely to see all year, Hawaii kicks off the midafternoon series with a visit to no. 1 Ohio State (3:30 p.m., BTN), while two programs striving for big breakthroughs meet in Fort Collins (Minnesota at Colorado State, 3:30 p.m., CBSSN). For aforementioned fight-song and zany-coach reasons, start the evening set by alternating between no. 19 Oklahoma at no. 23 Tennessee (6 p.m., ESPN) and Western Michigan at Georgia Southern (6 p.m., ESPN3), and add in Kentucky at South Carolina around halftime (7:30 p.m., SECN). The real fireworks get under way on ABC at 8 p.m., with no. 7 Oregon at no. 5 Michigan State. No. 14 LSU at no. 25 Mississippi State is staggered a little bit later for ample viewing of both games (9:15 p.m., ESPN), and our suggested nightcap is a potential sleeper hit matchup of no. 20 Boise State gunning for a potential playoff spot versus a BYU team that’s lost Taysom Hill, but brings in his place a sudden hero of Week 1 in Tanner Mangum (10:15 p.m., ESPN2).",2015-09-10T10:42:47+00:00,College Football,Anderson
17,Here There Be Dragons: The Return of UAB Football,"There’s a digital clock on the wall on the left going down the steps into the UAB football offices, done up like a miniature scoreboard, green and white with the team’s dragon-head insignia. It reads BLAZER FOOTBALL COUNTDOWN and has spaces for ticking off the remaining days, hours, minutes, and seconds until the next University of Alabama at Birmingham football game, and right now, it’s dark. The Blazers don’t live here, not the way they once did. Not since December, when the university clumsily disbanded the team. UAB reinstated football in the summer, after most of the athletes and all but a few of the staff had situated themselves in new schools, and while the program shudders back to life, the hallways remain mostly empty. Administrative assistant and team den mother Shannon Ritch says she still isn’t used to the absence of sound that follows a slamming door in the building. Each bang used to herald a parade of players, hooting and hollering and tumbling all over one another like packs of puppies walking upright. Now, the absence is palpable. Into the midst of this quiet afternoon bounds head coach Bill Clark on a literal ray of sunshine, calling goodbyes back over his shoulder to whomever he’s been talking to in the parking lot for the past half-hour. Removed from the doldrums of a lost offseason, Clark’s faintly maniacal grin is once again permanently affixed to his face. “You would never know,” says one of his players,1 “that we don’t have a game this weekend.” It is go-go-go-go-go time, for him and for what’s left of the Blazers, and they will worry about whether they have enough destinations to fill out the itinerary later. UAB football is not yet back to being UAB football, but Bill Clark is back to being Bill Clark, perpetually ebullient in the face of ridiculous odds. You kind of have to be to do something like join Joey Jones’s nascent South Alabama staff in Mobile and help spin a program out of nothingness.2 To leave your alma mater, Jacksonville State, to take over the left-for-dead Blazers. After UAB lost to Marshall 23-18 in the next-to-last week of the 2014 season, dropping the team to 5-6 and almost out of reach of bowl eligibility, Clark stopped me on the way out of his postgame interview sessions. “When you write your story,” he said, “make sure you mention we were about to come back.” On November 29, in the final game of Clark’s first year as head coach, UAB defeated Southern Miss 45-24 to become eligible for a bowl invitation, and was the first squad since the 2004 season not to post a losing record. But on December 2, the university announced it was cutting the football program, citing the unsustainable costs of competing in major-college athletics. The players and coaches scattered to new opportunities, to graduation, to the NFL. Clark, still under contract, stuck around. For one thing, he had his retirement plan to think of. He also wasn’t entirely convinced his program was dead. He occupied himself with family time, speaking engagements, trips to clinics and to observe coaching staffs whose work he admired, and trying to remain convinced he was doing anything other than treading water. Fending off a sense of professional whiplash didn’t come easily. “I tried to keep myself busy,” says Clark, “but when you’re used to working a hundred hours a week, what all can you do? There were days in there, waking up at 4:30 in the morning and going What just happened? But I think we all have those. It wasn’t like I was ruined. And things kept happening to tell me, ‘We are supposed to be here.’” The public outcry and bitter invective that accompanied the program’s axing, aimed chiefly at university president Ray Watts and the University of Alabama System’s Board of Trustees,3 didn’t go unnoticed. In April, an independently commissioned study found that the football program hadn’t been a money loser. Local business interests got involved. The city of Birmingham pledged monetary support. On June 1, UAB announced the football program, along with the folded bowling and rifle teams, would be reinstated, and Clark went back to, if not his once-habitual 100-hour weeks, something close enough to warp speed for his liking. He’d lost half a year of recruiting and relationship-building, and there wasn’t a moment to squander. “I’ve got to sell shovels in the ground,” he says. “We’ve got a great school, a great community, and we know football is important here. That’s what I was selling last year. But now it’s a different day. We’ve gotta build a whole program.” He fantasizes about forging new research partnerships between the athletic department and UAB’s well-regarded medical school. “I’m an old training guy. I want this to be the place you come to train. I want to see UAB sports science on the cutting edge, whether it’s concussions or optometry or nutrition.” And in the meantime, he’s got to build himself a football team. Like, almost an entire football team. In July, he signed his first player, Tyler Jones, a transfer from Memphis. In August, the remnants of last year’s Blazers reassembled on campus for workouts. Clark estimates he had 120 guys on the roster last December, and 33 now, about 20 of whom are walk-ons. It’s a near total rebuild, a concept not unfamiliar to a veteran of South Alabama. The UAB staff has its team working out on a schedule that closely resembles what would be spring ball in any other year. Clark could run regular practices, but he doesn’t want to. For one thing, he doesn’t have a quarterback. For another, with the Blazers not scheduled to resume play until 2017, what’s the point? The team is focused, for now, on purifying the raw materials it has on hand, and as someone who’s fond of calling himself “just an old strength-and-speed guy,” Clark is here in his element. “I’m proud of having them,” he says of his ragtag roster. “It’s kind of emotional. Here they are back, to be part of this. To be back, saying, ‘I believe.’” His three remaining assistants — Clark plans to hire back a full staff this December — are currently all fanned out on the road, selling that South Alabama pitch of immediate playing time and the idea of being first at something, or in this case, first back at it. “Maybe I was a good recruiter before,” says Clark, “now I need to be a great one. But I’ve got guys in the NFL right now that played for me last year, so I think I’ve got a little different message this time. And the fact that we’re playing big-boy football in ’17, it’s gonna be here before we know it.” The fight for UAB football is far from over, and not just on the roster. Clark, still operating under his initial three-year agreement, will need a new contract to even be able to see the next Blazers football team play its first game. The program hit its first major fundraising milestone ahead of schedule, but more hurdles loom. Legion Field, a dismal experience on a good day, is not a permanent solution. New facilities bring in more players, which leads to more wins, which leads to more money, which leads to facility upgrades. For months now, schematic drawings of future Blazers football facilities have piled up and spilled off of a coffee table in the corner of Clark’s office. And of course, there is the business with the board of trustees to contend with. There’s a vaguely Southern Gothic history in play here, between the university and its governors, and for all we know this is all part of the board’s grand design. The board’s history of thwarting attempts to improve the UAB football program is well documented; the real endgame here might be setting the Blazers up for more failure in order to demoralize university and civic support of the program for good, a plan much more insidious and roundabout than the spiking of Jimbo Fisher’s hiring or torpedoing plans for a new stadium outright. Don’t tell Clark that. He speaks of UAB football’s future as though it’s a foregone conclusion. “We’re still entertainment. So when we put a good product out there, the city will want to be part of it. And if we’re putting a good product out there under the circumstances we were in last year, what if they gave us what we needed? That’s been pretty cool, to see more and more people get that. We did pretty good, I like to say, with two hands behind our backs. Untie our hands, and let’s go to work. “We’re just gonna do it. It’s just gonna take a life of its own. Kind of where it’s supposed to have been this whole time.” It all might sound rather grandiose. Maybe it is, a little. But maybe that’s exactly what’s required for a program in UAB’s situation to succeed: a guy who’s made up his mind that the Blazers will succeed just as steadfastly as the powers determining it will not. Wouldn’t it be funny if, at the end of this dumb, dusty road, the board of trustees found that it had accidentally hired the right man for the job?",2015-09-09T09:11:58+00:00,College Football,Anderson
18,What to Watch: A Guide to College Football’s Opening Weekend,"Brothers and sisters, we made it. We’re out of the wilderness. We’re through the weeds. We’re running through tall grass with the blessed season in sight — and the sweetest reward of autumn is upon us, in the form of Florida International at UCF and North Carolina versus South Carolina, both kicking off at 6 p.m. on a Thursday night … Wait. WAIT. Come back! It’s still football! Sort of! It’s a football-like substance! Right, so, Week 1: never a time for the most heartstring-rending slate of games. Major programs are carrying out low-impact workouts against FCS schools. Big-name teams are facing off in the soulless confines of NFL stadiums hundreds of miles from either campus. Two Power 5 outfits are, this very week, traveling to games against directional Michigans. But just as Florida State hosts Texas State in the hopes of spotting any glaring game-plan flaws while in a low-stakes environment, so must you, the viewer, get in some warmup reps to avoid injury down the line. The season is a pot of still water, and you’ve got to turn the heat up slowly to really boil yourself alive in it.  All times Eastern. Top 25 Matchups: One. Adult humans in charge of no. 20 Wisconsin and no. 3 Alabama, two teams with fantastic game-day atmospheres back home and mighty, passionate fan bases, have decided to spend a weekend in the Dallas area in September, on purpose. They’ll meet in the Jerrydome, site of the 2014 national championship game, a 2015 playoff semifinal game, and precious little in between. Maybe that’s it. Maybe this is like a football mission trip, the Tide and Badgers bringing the good word to the downtrodden folk of Arlington. That’s sweet of them.

How High Are the Week 1 Stakes? The height of pole bean vines turning brittle and keeling over on the trellis. The heat of grilled cheese you made and then left sitting on the counter for 10 minutes because you decided you also wanted tomato soup. The potency of a Styrofoam cup of Cheerwine left in the car during an afternoon at the driving range. Destination Game: As long as the season continues to kick off over Labor Day weekend, there’s only ever going to be one best practice, which is to drop everything you’re doing and get to Atlanta for the people-watching event of the year. The annual neutral-site contest in the Georgia Dome brings in Louisville and no. 6 Auburn this season, pitting two of the sport’s most highly regarded offensive minds, Bobby Petrino and Gus Malzahn, against the last two defensive coordinators you’d want to bare-knuckle box, Todd Grantham and Will Muschamp. This game promises great fun in itself, but it’s the combination of ACC-SEC football and everything else happening in Atlanta at the same time that really gets the alchemy working: Dragon Con, Atlanta Black Pride Weekend, whatever happens to be going on at the Speedway (this week: Volkswagen show!), a 10K road race on Labor Day, and usually a Braves game or three thrown in (though mercifully, for everyone’s traffic-related cardiac events, there’s no home baseball this year). When you can walk into any centrally located bar and take a seat between a girl wearing fuzzy tiger ears and a tail arguing pass interference calls with a dude in a painstakingly reproduced Boba Fett outfit, you have to seize that opportunity. Grape Job, Scheduling Edition: One brightly colored “YOU TRIED, PROBABLY” sticker to whoever had the bright idea to bring Georgia Southern to West Virginia (7:30 p.m. Saturday, Fox Sports Go). This could be a very interesting game for unaffiliated viewers, but “interesting” isn’t typically a priority for athletic departments when plotting out their opening-week schedules. Group of 5 teams brought in for visits are expected to lose in spectacular fashion and are paid handsomely for their trouble, and GSU ain’t in the business of losing easily. The Eagles are well-liked around here for their habit of terrorizing bigger programs. They’re also down one starting quarterback for this game and coming into Morgantown at night, so we’ll see, won’t we? Grudge-ish Matches of the Week [TIE]: In a slate low on actual rivalry games that don’t involve in-state FCS teams getting fat checks to lose by 40 points to flagship universities, personnel moves supply the beef: Eastern Washington at no. 7 Oregon (8 p.m. Saturday, P12N) sends current Ducks starting quarterback Vernon Adams’s old team into Autzen, while Regular Washington, current home of Chris Petersen, travels to no. 23 Boise State, former home of Chris Petersen (10:15 p.m. Friday, ESPN). This Week in Why? On one hand, there are plenty of folks who’d like FBS teams to stick within the FBS for their nonconference games, and for those games to be played on the campuses themselves, where the deep, wacky regionalities of college football can be most keenly felt. On the other hand, who exactly went clamoring for Oklahoma State at Central Michigan (7 p.m. Thursday, ESPNU)? The answer has to involve T. Boone Pickens and fracking, surely. This Week in Why Not? No. 5 Michigan State at Western Michigan (7 p.m. Friday, ESPNU). This one at least keeps the money in the state economy, and it provides ample opportunity to imagine what it would be like stuck in the backseat between P.J. Fleck and Mark Dantonio on a cross-country road trip. Looming Upset-That-Is-Not: South Dakota State at Kansas (noon Saturday, Fox Sports Go). When North Dakota State beat Kansas State on opening weekend in 2013, that was a surprise. If Regular Kansas can stave off the advances of SDSU, which made it to the second round of last season’s FCS playoffs? That’ll be the upset. FCS-on-FBS Game Actually Worth Watching: Youngstown State at Pitt (1 p.m Saturday, ESPN3), if only for the press conferences and on-field postgame interactions between Bo Pelini and Pat Narduzzi. Youngstown native Pelini’s hot-mic mouth is familiar, but first-time head coach Narduzzi is already proving to be the sound-bite sleeper hit of the season: Pat Narduzzi w/ quite the first impression on the ACC teleconference, sharing a Scott Shafer tale from their URI days pic.twitter.com/Wt28m9GxeE — Matt Fortuna (@Matt_Fortuna) September 2, 2015  Thursday: Don’t rush home from work. Bank those early exits for later in the season, and give yourself until Michigan at Utah kicks off (8:30 p.m., FS1) to settle in. Once no. 2 TCU at Minnesota gets going (9 p.m., ESPN), alternate channels as needed. For a little extra kick, check in on UTSA at no. 22 Arizona (10 p.m., P12N) every now and then; the Roadrunners played the Wildcats within a field goal last year. True sickos or those with a four-day weekend already booked can stay up for a Colorado at Hawaii game that’s late even by Warriors standards (1 a.m., CBSSN), but don’t sacrifice too much sleep here; you’ll be up late the next three nights running. Friday: There’s a once-and-maybe-future rivalry game lurking here with No. 4 Baylor at SMU (7 p.m., ESPN). These former SWC foes have one additional meeting booked after this year, but if Chad Morris can execute a turnaround job on the Mustangs, more would be welcome. Camp out here for the duration, then stick around to watch Washington at no. 23 Boise State (10:15 p.m., ESPN). Swig your drink every time the camera cuts to Petersen after a big Broncos play. Saturday: Sleep in. There’s nothing in the first flight of games that need concern you if you’re not a fan of a playing team. Soak up some vitamin D outside. Then at 3:30 p.m., start flipping between Louisville vs. no. 6 Auburn (CBS) and BYU at Nebraska (ABC). The evening schedule gets a touch more crowded, but far from unmanageable with no. 15 Arizona State vs. Texas A&M (7 p.m., ESPN), Texas at no. 11 Notre Dame (7:30 p.m., NBC), and no. 20 Wisconsin vs. no. 3 Alabama (8 p.m., ABC). For a nightcap, hop over to Arkansas State at no. 8 USC (11 p.m., P12N) when Badgers-Bama concludes. Sunday: Sleep in again. Sleep all day, maybe. Interact with your family. Acknowledge your pets. Find a lake and jump in it and stay there for a while. You don’t want to see what Marshall does to visiting Purdue. Monday: There’s one game on the schedule, one that carries more than enough intrigue to stand by itself: no. 1 Ohio State at Virginia Tech, the defending national champs against the only team that beat them last year (8 p.m., ESPN).",2015-09-03T10:10:47+00:00,College Football,Anderson

This last bit’s important. College football contains multitudes, and to really live fully within its too-brief seasons, so must you. Even the most legacy-laden, die-hard fan has the emotional bandwidth to follow more than one team — and given that any weekend contains something like 75 games, it’d be unforgivably wasteful not to seize every opportunity to do so. The possibilities of fandom permutations are as limitless as your imagination. Some folks employ what you might call a strafing approach, and while there’s nothing illegal about that, isn’t it just the tiniest bit tacky? Don’t you crave a little curation in your football intake? The Grantland On Your Side Help Line is here for you. You tell us who you are, as well as the aspects you crave in an auxiliary fandom; you’ll then be promptly matched, space permitting, with a program that fits your interests. This marks the second year of this little experiment; a year later, most of those picks hold up pretty well. (This is not something that I, person who had South Carolina down as a playoff team last season, get to say a lot.) To the request line! @HollyAnderson coach who may be a crazy person, live animal mascot, weeknight games. I … look, I know how this is going to sound, but stay with me here: South Carolina. You’ve got Steve Spurrier, whose bonkers bona fides need no further illumination in this space. You’ve got Sir Big Spur, who once drank from a glass of Spurrier-branded wine on national television. And you’ve got the Gamecocks, back in their season-opening Thursday-night slot this very week, hosting North Carolina in Charlotte. This is by far the most common type of appeal sent in during the adoption phase, and it’s not hard to figure out why: Isn’t this, or something very near to this, what we all want out of the sport? A man who might go off-script near a hot mic; a wild animal who can’t be counted on to behave in front of a camera; a team frolicking for our collective enjoyment on a school night? @HollyAnderson I'm a Florida fan who can't feel love anymore, likes the forward pass and silly silly mistakes. The best final score is 55-52 Speaking of Spurrier, his former squad promises once again to be primarily powered by defense in 2015. It’s a 40-hour drive of nearly 2,800 miles from Gainesville to Pullman, Washington, but if you can cast your eyes that far, Washington State might be the move for you. Even without quarterback Connor Halliday, Mike Leach’s Cougars are still a better bet to throw than run on every single offensive play. This contraption may make a lot of noise and emit strangely colored puffs of smoke, but it feels safe to count on a couple of things: that Leach will coax buckets of points out of it, and that his sophomore-led offense will look pretty sophomoric at times. @HollyAnderson First time caller, long time listener, SEC guy stuck in PAC-12 country. What P12 team should I follow for late night ball? @HollyAnderson WM w/facial hair ISO a bad team that will be good next year. Want to have liked them before they were popular. Callers, it appears you both want the same thing, and for an answer, let’s stay out west with the California Golden Bears. With that nine-game Pac-12 schedule plus two home nonconference games, only their Week 3 trip to Texas takes them out of the league footprint, and Matt Hinton has the Bears pegged for a big leap this season. And even in weeks when they’re not part of the conference’s last flight of kickoffs, their games are all but guaranteed to run late into the night thanks to Sonny Dykes and Tony Franklin’s prolific passing tendencies. @HollyAnderson I'm looking for someone who will screw up a contenders season You have asked a question, West Virginia fan, and you may already have the answer in your own backyard. Your Mountaineers will need a hot start to avoid immediately torpedoing their own season — inviting Georgia Southern to Morgantown in Week 1 was whose idea again? — but look at when they play the Big 12’s three presumed front-runners and inhale the brimstone scent of trap games. TCU will be coming off a bye, Baylor coming off a road trip to Kansas, Oklahoma off a bye. This is shaping up to be a strong defensive season for the Eers (I know, right?), and they’re going to catch one of those teams off guard.1 @HollyAnderson I'M LOOKING TO MAXIMIZE SUFFERING. In accordance with Your will, O Caller, look no further than Your very most favored football program,2 Notre Dame. The Irish are ranked, rich at many skill positions, and enjoying a very favorable outlook on the season, which is sometimes where things tend to go all sideways for them. You’ll either be feasting on the lamentations of the Irish themselves or on those of their thirstiest detractors. Take Your pick. @HollyAnderson Weird tradition. Weird fanbase dialect. Antiquated offensive schemes. A team related disaster with its own Wiki. Midtier bowl This is some tall order, but the team that may come closest to fulfilling these myriad requests is Notre Dame’s Week 3 opponent, Georgia Tech. Traditions? Pick one. Dialect? Here’s a glossary full. Disaster? You betcha. And while the 2015 Yellow Jackets are well equipped to mow down their schedule, the odds are not on their side: Add trips to Notre Dame and Clemson, plus their regular-season rivalry with Georgia, plus drawing Florida State out of the Atlantic, and clearing every hurdle seems unlikely. Not that we all wouldn’t love to see Paul Johnson have to do extra press appearances for a playoff game, but a finish just outside the New Year’s Six slots is a better bet. @HollyAnderson Something with a little, 'True Detective Season 1.' If you’re specifically angling for a dispensation to root for LSU, caller, here you go. If not, well, the song remains the same as last year: Really, we could all do well to live a little bit more like LSU fans in our daily lives. @HollyAnderson Thanks for taking my call, I am looking for a long time loser ready to turn it around just enough to disappoint in December. Doesn’t this feel like NC State’s year? It kind of does, if the Wolfpack’s defensive prowess ever catches up to Jacoby Brissett and the ground game on offense! But make sure to place this prediction in its proper context: If it’s going to be NC State’s year, it’s going to unfold in the NC State way, which means that the one thing you can expect is unexpected ruination, the team’s primary association in recent years. Just ask Clemson in 2011. Ask Florida State in 2012.3 Or ask State fans themselves: @HollyAnderson as an nc state fan, the number of times nc state has a ruined nc state's own season is extraordinarily high. so all of them. — Mitch (@dmitchsmith) August 31, 2015  Far be it from me to try to pin the Wolfpack within any sort of predictive matrix, but that’s exactly what I’m here to do, so: Look for NCSU to knock off either Clemson on Halloween or Florida State two weeks later, to follow that up with a late loss to Syracuse, and to end its 2015 run with an even more inexplicable loss in a December bowl. Look, I don’t make the rules. @HollyAnderson high scoring offense w/ a defense that isn't vanilla. Smaller conference preferred. Doesn't have to be a great team. Thanks! If you can allow a little wiggle room when it comes to the “smaller conference” request, caller, a curveball: What about something in a nice Texas Tech, a team high on potential that’ll be happy to see a bowl this season after a 4-8 finish in 2014? Patrick Mahomes is one of the more exciting young quarterbacks you’ll see this year, and on defense, David Gibbs did underrated work as Tony Levine’s DC at Houston, and has now been imported to Lubbock to teach the team his own special game of Hungry Hungry Hippos. @HollyAnderson UVA, but with a functional offense Duke.4 Next! @HollyAnderson it will be nothing but beautifully shot footage of alien sex snakes and incoherent platitudes. It will make $200 million So it turns out that this tweet was in reply to a thread about Ridley Scott’s Prometheus, and was not specifically requesting a football team, but by the time I figured this out I’d already given you Arkansas. I think it tracks pretty well, don’t you?",2015-09-01T08:50:33+00:00,2015 College Football Preview,Anderson
20,The Sun Is Rising in Buffalo,"Jack Eichel is a teenager, and he will remain so for another year and two weeks. His hair is so tightly coiled, his cheeks so easily crimson, that you wonder exactly what sort of industrial operation churns away inside his head. He was taken second overall by the Buffalo Sabres in this summer’s NHL draft, though everyone seemed to agree that in any year without Connor McDavid on the board, Eichel would have been the first pick. Eichel spent last season attending Boston University, having grown up in Massachusetts, and even when he suits up as the Green Bay Packers in a game of Madden, he monkeys with the settings so that they run the New England Patriots’ plays. “You gotta use Belichick’s playbook,” he says, with a deadpan assurance that would no doubt be appreciated by the impassive coaching legend himself. Eichel is at his stall in the Sabres locker room on the morning of a preseason game day in late September, and that is good news for everyone: It means he’s in the lineup tonight. A week earlier, as the Sabres got set for their first home game of the preseason, Eichel wasn’t on the roster. Sabres fans understand that not every player appears in every game during the early stages of training camp, but that didn’t make them any less bummed. “Why isn’t Eichel playing?” kids asked their parents outside the arena. “Ugh, no Eichel tonight,” dudes remarked to dudes inside the expansive (716) Food and Sport. A Sabres beat writer regarded me with mock pity: “Aw, you’re missing Eichel.” The reporter had just returned from Minnesota, a trip he wouldn’t normally make during training camp, but it had been worth it. The game wasn’t televised, so he was lucky to have been there in person to see Eichel’s debut: one goal, one assist. The way everyone talked about the kid made him sound less like an athlete and more like a hot new restaurant or a limited-time-only museum show. You almost wanted to call him the Eichel, as if you were referring to the Marina Abramovic at the MoMA or something. Either way, the name of the exhibit could definitely be the same: “The Artist Is Present.” ??? With all of this attention on the team’s youngest member, it’s easy to forget that he’s far from the only notable new face on Buffalo’s revamped roster. Following two straight seasons of finishing DFL in the NHL, of approaching losing as a legitimate tactical goal rather than an outcome to avoid at all costs, the Sabres are now attempting to make a power turn and start transitioning back up the ice. General manager Tim Murray — a quirky former scout described by the Buffalo News as the “bespectacled brewmaster of this Sabres’ rebuild” — has attempted to make good on an April 2014 promise that the evolution of the franchise would not rely on some goalpost-pushing five-year (or more!) plan. Jaded Buffalo fans, who love hockey so deeply that they can consistently be counted upon to generate top-five TV ratings regardless of whether their team wins (or is even out on the ice), might roll their eyes at this; the Sabres have missed the playoffs in six of the last eight seasons and haven’t advanced past the first round since 2007. But there’s reason to believe that the Sabres finally have a little skip in their skates. Last winter, Buffalo acquired 24-year-old hotshot Evander Kane, who also once made an NHL roster at age 18, and a few years later had racked up a 57-point season. And thanks to some urging by Tyler Ennis, Murray made a draft-day trade in June that yielded Ryan O’Reilly, the sort of faceoff-taking, tough-minutes-swallowing player who gets roundly praised as underrated so often that the label starts to seem impossible by definition. The Sabres also hired head coach Dan Bylsma, formerly of the Pittsburgh Penguins and the U.S. national team. They bought low on defenseman Cody Franson. They traded for Ottawa goalie Robin Lehner. And they made it known that, while they were clearly targeting established NHL talent, they’d also be giving a shot to some of the upsidey youngsters they had accumulated with their recent lottery picks, like 20-year-old defenseman Rasmus Ristolainen and 19-year-old forward Sam Reinhart. This turnover all happened one year after Matt Moulson, who was traded from the Sabres to the Minnesota Wild in March 2014, came back to Buffalo — of his own volition! — when he became a free agent that summer. Choosing to return to such a floundering franchise may have seemed like an oddball career choice, but Moulson liked what he saw: some method to the madness, a general manager unafraid to strike, a promising roster mix of youth and experience, and generous, passionate ownership. “I believed that when I signed back here that they can win a Stanley Cup,” Moulson said. “And they’ve done the right things to go in that direction. We have a lot of work to do, but it’s the right start.” It hasn’t just been the hockey operations side of the business that has signaled a bold willingness to deal. The mentality originates all the way at the top — in this case, with multibillionaire owners Terry and Kim Pegula, who made their vast fortune in natural gas and have been spending it for years now on sports franchises, hockey rinks, urban development projects, and the intersection of all three. ??? Tom Szczerbowski/Getty Images “When we came up here five years ago and Terry told me he wanted to buy the Buffalo Sabres, the truth of it is I tried to talk him out of it,” admitted Cliff Benson, the team’s chief development officer. He was standing in front of a crowd of mostly developers, politicians, and hospitality professionals gathered for a ribbon-cutting ceremony in honor of the three-week-old Marriott behind him. Through a big picture window about six floors up, people on exercise bikes and ellipticals gazed determinedly across cloudy skies, highway overpasses, and the Buffalo River canal. “Number one, I said, why don’t we go to Florida? It’s a little bit warmer. And secondly, I said, if you’re going to own a sports team, you’re getting into a whole different business. Everyone’s going to shoot at you every day. And he said to me, ‘We’re going to Buffalo. We’re going to change that city, and that’s why we’re getting into the sports business: so we have a platform to change the city.’” The Pegulas spent $189 million in February 2011 to purchase the Sabres (as well as the National Lacrosse League’s Buffalo Bandits).1 It wouldn’t be their last purchase of a sports franchise. Last October, one of the Pegula daughters, Jessie, a professional tennis player, finished a workout and tweeted a screenshot of her phone. It showed the weather in Boca Raton, Florida, a vet appointment reminder, and a brief text from Dad: “We own Bills,” it said. The Pegulas had beaten out Donald Trump and a consortium fronted by Jon Bon Jovi with an all-cash, $1.4 billion offer to buy the NFL team from late owner Ralph Wilson’s estate.2 ??? In the beginning, the Pegulas’ willingness to spend money got the Sabres into some trouble. The six-year, $27 million contract the team gave Ville Leino in the summer of 2011 would go down as one of the more egregious displays of wallet-emptying optimism in recent NHL history. (Last summer, the team bought out Leino’s contract, and he currently plays professional hockey in Latvia.) The Sabres failed to reach the playoffs that year and haven’t since, a trend that — depending on whom you ask — reached either its zenith or its logical cold-blooded conclusion last season as Buffalo nakedly maneuvered into last place in the standings. Jack Eichel was part of the reason why. For several years, hockey insiders had been eyeing the trajectories of two young players the way meteorologists project the development and location of faraway tropical storms. In 2012, when he was 15, a good Ontario boy named Connor McDavid signed an endorsement contract with Reebok and was granted exceptional player status to allow him to play major junior hockey despite his young age.3 That same year, Eichel made a verbal commitment to one day suit up for Boston University. With both players eventually eligible for the 2015 NHL draft, their particular class became one of the most anticipated hockey cohorts in some time. The consensus among scouts and other observers was that McDavid would almost certainly be selected first overall but that Eichel was such a lovely consolation prize that it was pretty hard to go wrong either way. The two-headed beast that came to be known as “McEichel,” combined with NHL lottery rules that guaranteed the league’s last-place team would, at worst, pick second in the draft,4 created a set of circumstances that led to one of the more blatant races to the bottom. Some of the moves the Sabres made to best position the team for certain disgrace were remarkably savvy. In February, the Winnipeg Jets decided they’d had enough with Kane, who traveled with the former Atlanta Thrashers up to the team’s new home in Manitoba and in doing so went, not always fairly, from a young hockey sensation to a frequent subject of sensationalist headlines. (One of his more notorious crimes: posing for tacky photos in Vegas.) When the news came out that the frustrated Kane would be getting season-ending shoulder surgery, Murray, the GM, saw a great opportunity: Here was a chance to acquire a truly skilled young player at a reasonable cost, without having to actually play him and risk winning just yet. A Dallas Stars blog summed up the transaction as “the Mona Lisa of tank related masterpieces.” But there were other springtime happenings that were far more awkward. When the basement-dwelling Arizona Coyotes beat the Sabres in overtime in late March, the Buffalo home crowd loudly rejoiced. Eichel started getting text messages from buddies about the phenomenon. “It’s kind of a bizarre thing to think about — that fans are cheering against their team, hoping they lose,” he told the Toronto Star. “But I guess, really, they’re just excited about the future.” ??? In the interim between buying the Sabres and securing the Bills, the Pegulas kept themselves busy with a development project on land adjacent to First Niagara Center, the Sabres’ arena. For years, the building had sat next to an uninspiring hodgepodge of parking lots and waterfront land — “this was a tragedy when we got here,” is how Benson put it; “we had ship parts and dirt” — and when the city sought proposals for how to make use of the area, Pegula put his hat into the ring. Benson warned Pegula that developing a couple of hockey rinks and two levels of parking, their initial idea, would cause him to lose about $30 million out of pocket. Several years later, the project had ballooned into a couple of hockey rinks, five levels of parking, an athlete training center, several retail spaces and some restaurants, and a 200-room Marriott.5 The eventual price tag for what came to be Harborcenter topped $200 million of the Pegulas’ money. Millions of dollars worth of tax abatements, to be repaid from eventual proceeds generated by the new buildings, bolstered the development. Now, with the finished project rising behind them, the town’s movers and shakers preened. Benson quoted the Book of Jeremiah: “If the city prospers, you too will prosper.” Mayor Byron Brown said that images of Buffalo as a place where nothing ever gets done were now fading away. Lance Shaner, an old buddy of the Pegulas who now owns the hotel group that operates the new Marriott, called Terry and Kim “dream-makers.” Pegula himself got up and spoke for a few minutes. He earned serious laughs from the friendly crowd when he referred to his old-timey flip phone as “my handy-dandy here” and reminisced about how far he and Shaner had come. He could remember back when they were two unknowns playing racquetball in Olean, New York, he said, and now Shaner “has got a couple of jets down in State College.” (Somehow, he made this line sound almost folksy.) He compared Buffalo’s potential to Pittsburgh, which went “from a dingy, smelly steel town into what is a pretty impressive city” thanks to the efforts of “a bunch of businesspeople and government getting together.” He said that while a lot of people see him as a Republican, he prefers to consider himself an American. “We could be feeling a little bit better today,” he admitted, referring to the Bills’ loss a day earlier to the New England Patriots. “But on the other side of town it’s still early,” he concluded, “and it’s early here, too.” Staffers hurriedly unpacked sets of giant ceremonial scissors from bespoke giant ceremonial scissor cases and unspooled large swaths of ceremonial red ribbon from bespoke ceremonial red ribbon spools. Smiling for the cameras, the Pegulas and their collaborators stood at the Marriott parking valet station, counted to three, and made declarative snips. They repeated this in various permutations of people, pausing to sub in fresh lengths of ribbon for a good 10 to 15 minutes. ??? Evander Kane was at a waterfront restaurant in Malibu with a hockey buddy and both of their girlfriends this April when the NHL draft lottery rolled around. They asked a bartender to switch on the telecast, left the ladies at the table, and then watched as the Sabres didn’t win. With the league’s worst record, the Sabres had a 20 percent chance of drawing the top pick; the Coyotes were second at 13.5 percent, and the Edmonton Oilers — who in 2010, 2011, and 2012 occupied the no. 1 spot — had an 11.5 percent shot at getting first dibs once again. Thanks in part to geography, Sabres fans had grown particularly enamored of McDavid over the years, many of them making the less than two-hour drive down the shore of Lake Erie to Pennsylvania to see him play for the OHL’s Erie Otters. (Murray was among them: “I watch him too much and I think too much about him,” he admitted to the New York Times in late March. “I wish I could help myself.”) “Yeah, that was surprising,” recalled Kane of watching Edmonton’s name being called, a small smirk playing across his face. Murray hadn’t been smiling, nor did he mince words when speaking to reporters. “I feel for the fans,” he said. “I mean, we went through a tough year, and I think that they were extremely excited about Connor.” Eichel handled the awkward situation gracefully, pointing out that “I have a lot to offer” and asking “Who doesn’t want to be first?” A few months later, when he was brought in to meet with the Sabres at the NHL combine in Buffalo, he told Pegula that his parents had been happy when Buffalo lost the lottery. “Maybe we won the lottery,” one Sabres employee replied. “I think you did,” Eichel said. On the day of the draft, Edmonton selected McDavid with their no. 1 pick. As the Sabres contingent made its way to the podium, Murray caught Eichel’s eye in the crowd and stared him down. Most general managers give a little song and dance before they make their pick, thank the host city, congratulate the Cup winners — Murray did none of that. He had scarcely even gotten to the mic before he leaned in and said just four words: “Buffalo selects Jack Eichel.” ??? Bill Wippert/NHLI via Getty Images Besides drafting Eichel, trading for O’Reilly, hiring Bylsma, getting Lehner, and acquiring Kane (and defenseman Zach Bogosian, his Winnipeg teammate), a Pegula-owned team made another hefty — well, once-hefty — offseason move earlier this year: It got Rex Ryan. The self-described “biggest bandwagon” fan in hockey, Ryan has seemingly never turned down a chance to turn up in a jersey. The first-year Bills coach donned Rangers blue, Devils red, Flyers orange; he’s dropped the puck at an Islanders game in a Billy Smith sweater. He’s changed colors midgame. And yet he actually does have something of a hockey background, having spent much of his youth in the greater Toronto area, where he played street hockey6 and cheered for the Maple Leafs. Ever the showman, Ryan recorded a video welcoming Bylsma to town when the Sabres hired the former Penguins coach, making sure to tie in the “One Buffalo” sports branding that the Pegulas have instituted across their various team holdings. He pointed out Bylsma’s offensive background and said it would mesh well with Ryan’s defensive focus. Bylsma returned the favor after one practice, saying he wanted to talk about a Bills win over Miami, and that he wished he could run hockey preseason like NFL training camp. Several weeks ago, when Ryan walked out for his routine Wednesday press conference, he had hockey on the mind. “So let’s start with the Sabres,” he said. “That Eichel — he’s an impressive kid.” The night before, Eichel — the Eichel — had been on full display. In a preseason game against the Toronto Maple Leafs, Eichel snagged the puck and opened scoring with a shorthanded breakaway goal in which he somehow managed to get exponentially faster with each stride while still barely looking as though he were skating at all. He was still wearing no. 41, not wanting to change into his desired no. 15 because, as he humbly pointed out, he still hadn’t technically made the team. After the game, which Buffalo won 4-0, Eichel was practically giddy, his mouth yapping and his face flushed. “Only questions about Evander Kane!” he shouted as Kane, wrapped in a towel, tried to slide by his stall undetected to hit the showers. (A night earlier, the two had checked out a WWE event at First Niagara Center; Eichel has hit up a Bills game and a Shania Twain concert in the last few weeks as well.) He chatted about his rising comfort level with teammates and about scoring in front of the home crowd. It was easy to see what Moulson, who with his wife and two children is hosting Eichel in his home this season,7 meant when he described his houseguest as “the type of person who likes to always be doing something — he’ll get up out of the blue and start playing with the kids.” When a small media scrum developed around young prospect Evan Rodrigues, Eichel’s former BU teammate who had scored twice that night, Eichel sneaked over and hovered shirtless over the back of the group, blue eyes boring into Rodrigues’s soul as the poor guy tried his best not to laugh. ??? Buffalo fans are grimly conditioned to always prepare for the worst; they’ve lived through Scott Norwood’s “Wide Right” and Brett Hull’s “Skate in the Crease” and have, perhaps most valiantly, weathered endless yuks about their weather. They’ve watched one of their most beloved hockey locals, Patrick Kane, go through a terribly ugly and twisted summer, and seen one of their most exciting hockey newcomers, Ryan O’Reilly, sign with the Sabres and almost immediately get arrested back home for, according to police, drunk-driving an antique pickup truck into a Tim Hortons. And so, when the season began with the team’s already questionable defensive corps banged up even further, and when Robin Lehner played poorly in goal and then promptly injured his ankle so badly that he won’t be playing at all for quite some time, and when the Sabres opened up their season — Ryan’s enthusiasm aside — with a pair of losses, it all felt bleakly familiar. Here we go again, and this time we can’t even tank. But that first loss, to the Ottawa Senators, had silver linings: Eichel scored his first NHL goal, a top-shelf snipe that was as lethal as it was preternaturally poised, and the fans got to hear the hilarious new goal song they’d voted in: DJ Kool’s “Let Me Clear My Throat.” It sounded ridiculous; it felt perfect. Shortly after Eichel opened the scoring, Kane tied the game, but the goal was called back based on a belated video review of an offside skate. Rasmus Ristolainen, the 20-year-old Finnish defenseman whom the Sabres took eighth overall in the 2013 draft and whom Bylsma compares to Ekblad and Olli Maatta, almost added a goal, but it bounced off the post. All of these things were, at the very least, promising. A 4-1 loss to the Tampa Bay Lightning could be more easily written off: They were the reigning Eastern Conference champs, after all. On Monday, in a Columbus Day matinee against the Blue Jackets, it all started coming together. Ristolainen finally netted that goal. O’Reilly also scored, assisted by Moulson and offseason pickup Jamie McGinn. The Blue Jackets narrowed the score to 2-1, and two minutes later Jack Eichel did a Jack Eichel thing. “Eichel steals puck and picks the top corner” is how the NHL chose to title its goal video, but a YouTube account called All Things Buffalo Sabres described it much more succinctly, and much better: “Jack Eichel Sick Goal.” With the puck in Columbus’s zone, Eichel first tried setting up an assist. The puck ricocheted out to the blue line, and he won the race to it, narrowly and calmly keeping it in. He circled back around toward the far side of the faceoff circle, as if this were some casual warm-up drill, and skated wide. He saw Columbus goalie Sergei Bobrovsky go down, so he shot the puck up. Play-by-play guy Rick Jeanneret’s voice wavered and cracked. The fans were beside themselves. “dirty,” tweeted Jessie Pegula. “I watched this at least 15 times in a row #unreal,” added Kelly Pegula, her sister. It was a Broadway performance, it was event viewing, it was a showstopper, it was an exhibit — Eichel’s “latest piece of artwork.” Yeah, yeah, it was the team’s third game, fine. But Sabres fans had gotten their chance to see the Eichel at the First Niagara Center. The artist was finally present. And it was worth every dollar of the hard-earned price of admission.",2015-10-14T15:08:24+00:00,NHL,Baker
21,"Odell Beckham Jr., Ryan Tannehill, and What Happens When NFL Players Get a Little Weird","Of all the judgments levied against Giants wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. following last Sunday’s game against the Bills — that he was a “prima donna,” that he punched safety Duke Williams in the helmet out of frustration, that he plays like a tantrum-throwing “little brother,” that he owed the league nearly $9,000 in fines for his fed-up physical retaliation — the most cutting description may have been the most simple. “He’s weird,” said Bills cornerback Stephon Gilmore after the game, explaining that Beckham seems to take physicality quite personally on the field. Then he said it again: “He’s weird.” It’s one thing, in professional sports, to be a freak of nature; it’s another to just be a freak. We like those otherworldly one-handed catches to come at us like slabs of meat at an à la carte steakhouse, unadorned on a “careful, this is hot” platter. We’re less enthralled when there are all sorts of other distracting froufrou on the plate. And for good reason: In the wrong hands, that parsnip-cauliflower foam ruins everything. Done correctly, though, it sure can be delicious. Think of the person you know who is the least familiar with football: They’re almost certainly aware of Beckham’s glorious touchdown reception from last season. It wasn’t a sports highlight, it was a cultural event. But for as mainstream as that catch became, it was the sort of success that took root on the fringes. That one-handed grab was never just about sheer physical ability and swagger and Madden covers and all-expenses-paid trips to Hawaii, even if that was the narrative the league was so thrilled to present. It was also the product of compulsive obsession, of a life lived very differently from yours and mine, and of a human probably being, for quite some time now, pretty weird.  Late last month, a press release went out announcing a new media company whose sole equity holder, according to Bloomberg, is the NFL Players Association. Called ACE Media, which stands for “Athlete Content & Entertainment,” the business will produce “compelling sports-lifestyle content focused on athletes, whom fans would otherwise know solely through their statistics and game highlights.” That’s an interesting characterization of fans, who are well aware of much more about the lives of their favorite (and most-hated) athletes than what they see on SportsCenter. Plenty of this supplemental knowledge is mundane — you have to see only a few days’ worth of bland “rise and grind” tweets from some protein-powder-shilling doofus to get the sense there actually might not be much more there there — but much of it is a delight, for reasons ranging from the wholesome to the nefarious. (Instagram followers of former Giants safety Stevie Brown know that he’s happiest in the kitchen; those with Google Alerts for his old teammate Victor Cruz are chuckling these days about his comfort level with a different room in the house.) It’s not even just social media stalking that gets us there, though. Good old-fashioned beat reporting serves up stories like this week’s news that Ryan Tannehill lost it during Dolphins practice and berated the scout team heroes who were forcing turnovers against his first-string offense. “Enjoy your practice squad paycheck,” he reportedly scoffed in the direction of some suntanned Rudy Ruettigers. “Enjoy your practice squad trophy.” Hilariously, Tannehill’s reaction to the report was to claim he was being slandered: Fine, he may have said the part about trophies, but he never mentioned paychecks, so there! This is such benign stuff; imagine Kobe Bryant or Michael Jordan reading it and having a hearty, evil laugh. In the wake of Greg Hardy’s recent gross scrum, it also seems utterly pointless to even contemplate. But the fact that it blew up at all says a lot about how carefully managed the league tries to remain. Yes, it makes Tannehill seem kind of jerky and lame — ideally you’d want your quarterback to hammer his chest and take on all comers, just like Tom Brady, although it’s unclear whether the scout squad guys were deviating from their hired roles — but maybe that’s a good thing? I suddenly find myself wanting to know much more about the guy than I ever did before. After all, it was only recently that Marcus Mariota was being compared to Tannehill as two “great athletes with quiet personalities,” and as we know, in this league, Mariota’s lack of red flags was itself a red flag. The NFL is like that famous Apple commercial: What it really wants are the crazy ones, the misfits, the rebels. But in contrast to Apple, the league will never own up to that. Its quirkiest show of personality is carefully dished up in the form of a different set of commercials, those omnipresent DirecTV yuks. Chris Trotman/Getty Images ACE Media has the potential to move beyond this — to give us fewer softballs and more Hard Knocks — but will it? The operation that comes up again and again by point of comparison is The Players’ Tribune, a site that has certainly featured some interesting content from perspectives we wouldn’t otherwise get, but remains defined by the meticulously managed personality profile of founder Derek Jeter. The stated mission of ACE Media, meanwhile, is “to showcase athletes in ‘genuine, gritty and interesting’ programs that will transcend the jersey-wearing audience,” as Ahmad Nassar, the president of NFL Players Inc., the union’s licensing and marketing operation, told Bloomberg’s Scott Soshnick. Nassar then provided Soshnick with a representative example of what he meant: 10 players appearing on an episode of Family Feud. So, let’s play: What might the survey say about Odell Beckham Jr.? At the start of last season, probably not all that much; this time a year ago, he was getting set to play only his second NFL game. Fast-forward a bit and you’d get descriptions like “Offensive Rookie of the Year” and “naked on the cover of ESPN The Magazine’s Body Issue” and “the New York Giants’ future.” This sort of ascent has got to be unbelievably overwhelming, a total shock to the system. It’s not a good look to see him getting so easily riled up on the field, but it’s not surprising either: He went from being just another on-field target to having the bull’s-eye squarely on his back. You don’t have to be a “prima donna” or consider yourself a “golden boy” to overreact by lashing out with a frustrated helmet smack. (Sports fans prefer more deliberate shows of aggression, such as carefully shadowboxing Gatorade coolers.) But prima donna and golden boy are easily digestible archetypes in the acceptable arc of a player’s career; they make sense, and they stick, and the Family Feud survey would probably include them today. “Weird,” though — weird is tougher. Weird shows up at your door toting baggage like context and asks if it can crash for a while. Weird fanatically practices one-handed catches in the backyard for an uncomfortable amount of time while you and your buddies crack open some beers. Weird seems pretty cool, actually, until weird does something to make everyone just a leeeettle weirded out. Weird’s a good dude at heart, though. Keep ODB Weird. Weird is what the NFL needs.",2015-10-09T13:33:04+00:00,NFL,Baker
22,The Patrick Kane Situation Takes a Dark Turn in Buffalo,"UPDATE: Late Thursday evening, Attorney Thomas Eoannou abruptly called a press conference. He said his firm had spoken with the district attorney and continued to do its own investigation into the paper bag that was purported to have contained the rape kit. Based on new information he had received about the alleged victim’s mother’s acquisition of the evidence, Eoannou said that he felt “misrepresentations were made to me” and announced that “because I no longer have confidence in the story given to me, I’m withdrawing from the case.”  Shortly after noon on a sunny Wednesday in downtown Buffalo, a collection of reporters and cameramen milled around in front of a white French Renaissance Revival building, speculating idly about why they were there. A few stood near a sign identifying the place as Cornell Mansion — built in the late 19th century for a lead baron “reported to be the best-looking gentleman in the City of Buffalo” — while others sat beneath a statue of Lady Justice, with her scales and her double-edged sword reminding visitors that law offices now lived inside. What did criminal attorney Tom Eoannou, who the night before had called for this press conference, want to announce? In early August, Eoannou’s client, a 21-year-old woman, had been out on a Saturday night just a few blocks away at the rooftop dance club SkyBar, up above a ground-level Irish pub called D’Arcy McGee’s. Buffalo-area native Patrick Kane, who was planning to bring the Stanley Cup to the venue a few nights later to celebrate his third championship in six seasons, wound up there too. Later, both of them, along with a couple of their friends, reportedly left to go hang out late night at Kane’s lakefront home, everyone chauffeured there by an off-duty local cop who has been employed by the Chicago Blackhawks star for the past five years. The number of people who know what happened next can be counted on one hand. By the time the sun rose, Eoannou’s client had turned up at an area hospital to submit samples and evidence for a rape kit. Kane has since been investigated for, though not charged with, a crime. Some of the people loitering outside the Cornell Mansion — a mix of sports, crime, and local news reporters — suggested that there was an outside chance Eoannou might be announcing an end to the investigation. Over the last few days, there had been leaked reports that Kane’s DNA had been found on the accuser’s shoulder and beneath her fingernails, but nowhere below her waist. Others felt it more likely that he wanted to publicly denounce these leaks, to accuse his opponents of dirty dealings through the media. The press was let into a conference room that seemed to have been hastily thrown together by a set designer for a legal TV drama, all dark wood, gilded ceilings, and lots and lots of glass: a glass light fixture hanging from a gold chain, stained glass above the door, glass-front bookshelves holding volumes of West’s McKinney’s Forms, double old-fashioned glasses etched with “Crown Royal” next to a water pitcher. TV crews fiddled with their connections; photographers snapped test shots. “Who’s gonna tweet for us?” someone asked a colleague. “Does he know how to tweet?” A woman with the law firm came in and handed a stack of glossy blown-up photos to a reporter in shirtsleeves, telling him to pass them around. He peered at them through his reading glasses. “They’re pictures of … paper bags,” he said, as others scrambled to look. “Are these evidence bags?” someone asked, and the woman nodded. People took pictures of them and tried to make sense of what they meant. Eoannou walked in, sat down, and delivered prepared remarks. He sounded calm but pissed. “It was never my intention to comment or try this case in the media,” he began. “However, during the course of this investigation, multiple leaks to the media have occurred … [they] have all been troublesome, to say the least.” So that was it: He was here to shake his head at the other side, to take the next logical step in a battle that has so far played out not only publicly, but with a grim predictability. First had come the accusations, then the dissection of their worth. Next came the interviews with peripheral characters advancing disparate agendas. After that, the leaks. Now this would be the condemnation. But then he kept speaking: “We have encountered a far more troublesome situation,” he said. “This concerns the integrity of that evidence. Yesterday the rape kit evidence bag was anonymously delivered to the home of my client’s mother.” The room was filled with camera shutter clicks and flashes as he held up a clear Ziploc containing a crumpled, ripped, and empty paper bag, one about the size you’d get at a grocery store. Even the unflappable crime reporters sitting in their reserved leather chairs appeared caught off-guard. “In my 30-years-plus of being both a prosecutor and a defense attorney,” he said, “I have never seen an evidence bag outside a police lab, a prosecutor’s office, or a courtroom — let alone find one in the doorway of a rape victim’s mother’s home.” He explained that the bag was empty, but that his team had determined — based on identifying labels, discussions with hospital workers, and consultations with former district attorneys — that it had once held the results of the rape kit administered to his client. This was something that was supposed to have remained intact, he said, with a clear paper trail denoting its chain of custody. Its very presence in this room today, therefore, brought into question the sanctity of the physical evidence that had been collected and preserved within. Eoannou painted an almost cinematic picture: The bag, folded several times, had been left wedged between the house’s storm door and its front door. It was discovered when the accuser’s mother came home for lunch on Tuesday afternoon. He thanked the person who had left it there. “I’m sorry, you’d like to thank them for doing this?” someone interjected. Yes, and also to ask them to please come forward, Eoannou replied. ??? AP Photo/Gary Wiepert The Chicago Blackhawks’ Patrick Kane on the first day of training camp. As with everything that has unfolded here in Buffalo and in the nearby town of Hamburg since August 1, there are multiple prisms through which to view each piece of information, and Eoannou’s implication — that a “good Samaritan” dropped off the bag to alert the accuser’s family that something shady might be happening behind the scenes — is just one possible conclusion to be drawn from an action open to wild interpretation. And it’s just the latest twist in an inquiry that has transfixed and disturbed a city, a community, and an entire sport. Over the past weeks, dueling developments have ricocheted back and forth through the press, each one proving both everything and nothing, depending on whom you ask. First, the SkyBar owner, Mark Croce, told the Buffalo News that a woman had hovered near and hung “all over” Kane that night — “I noticed it and kind of laughed about it,” he said. His comments were variously interpreted as gross victim-shaming, as opportunistic kissing-up to a valuable customer — and as she-wanted-it evidence that Kane couldn’t have done anything wrong. Friends of the accuser would later counter that she was not even the same woman Croce described. It was pointed out that in 2009, after bar-hopping around the same neighborhood where SkyBar is located, Kane was arrested after police said he punched a cab driver over a dispute about spare change. We were reminded that in 2012, he passed out at a Wisconsin bar while wearing a shirt with his own inebriated image printed on it. To some, this indicated a history of drunken, even violent behavior. To others, it just painted him as a vulnerable target. A grand jury was scheduled, then indefinitely postponed. Many NHL fans were outraged when Kane showed up to Blackhawks training camp as usual and then sat alongside his coach, general manager, and team president for an uncomfortable press conference in which he repeated the line “I appreciate the question” again and again — though he didn’t appreciate them enough to answer them, apparently. Others argued that sidelining him would set a really tricky precedent: He had not been charged with anything, so why shouldn’t he be allowed to play? This is a particularly high-profile situation, to be sure; most rape and sexual assault cases aren’t reported on the daily news. But early on, the arguments and prejudices and frustrations and privileges and details involved are ones that have grown depressingly familiar. Lots of alcohol. Statistics about the tiny percentages of falsely reported rapes countered with examples of the highly publicized occasions in which rapes have been falsely reported. Ever-evolving understandings about consent and about what constitutes a criminal offense. (“I came to understand that what passed for a ‘bad hookup’ when I was in college is today what we would rightly call rape,” Sarah Ellison wrote in a Vanity Fair article about the recent UVa. debacle.) When Eoannou held up that brown paper bag, though, what was once an almost rote, if awfully dismal, investigation blew up into an unsettling and beastly Rorschach print. What did it all mean? Who was involved? It could be, as Eoannou suggested, a whistle-blower concerned with mishandling of evidence, sure. Or it could be quite the opposite: an attempt at intimidation, a sort of you don’t wanna know what will show up at your doorstep next. It is impossible not to conjure a mental image — multiple mental images — of the person creeping up to a suburban Buffalo set of front doors, opening one of them, and making the drop. It’s hard not to extrapolate all kinds of things from there. Then you stop yourself: This isn’t Gone Girl or a John Grisham novel or Law & Order, this is real people’s unraveling lives. Eoannou’s press conference was not the whole of yesterday’s developments but just the start. The conflicting stories started stacking up, turning a he-said, she-said into a he-said, he-said, he-said. First, Patrick Kane’s lawyer Paul Cambria called a hastily assembled meeting of his own. “First of all, the victim has not been determined in this case, yet,” he said. “I think my client’s a victim of this case.” Sitting in front of a bookshelf holding a conspicuous commemorative 40th-anniversary Hustler mug — Cambria has famously represented Larry Flynt — the attorney (who recently argued with folks on Facebook about the case) was brash in his remarks. Responding to Eoannou’s comment that “if you’re looking for a surefire way to scuttle the prosecution, you may tamper with the evidence,” Cambria said: “To me, if you don’t like the results, then you start the smoke.” While Eoannou had called this week’s DNA leaks “a classic example of why rape victims don’t come forward” and deemed it “the worst case of victim-blaming I’ve ever seen,” Cambria reiterated that a “mixture” of DNA not belonging to Kane was found on the accuser and characterized this not as victim bashing — but as just the facts. During his earlier press conference, Eoannou had shot down questions about the potential for a monetary settlement, saying that he’s never been a part of one and that he’s the last person in town the accuser would hire if that’s what she were after. Cambria openly mused about whether Eoannou’s aggressive announcement had been prudent. “It’ll be interesting to see how this plays out and whether it’s a tremendous backfire,” he said. By the end of the day, everything grew murkier. Both the Hamburg Police Department and Erie County Central Police Services released statements insisting that the rape kit had been collected, stored, and transported in an “unassailable” manner, and that what they consider to be the original evidence bag remains in the possession of law enforcement. (Eoannou has not backed down on his allegation that the bag delivered to his client’s mother’s home is authentic.) Erie County’s district attorney announced an investigation into everyone’s confounding stories. Everywhere I went in Buffalo yesterday — the bar for lunch, the cab to get back to my hotel, even the hotel’s front desk — people were chatting about the day’s events. Some had stories about encounters they’d had over the years with Kane himself; others had loud theories about the fragile psyches of women generally. Nearly all eventually defaulted to one of two safe, true-but-meaningless assessments of what’s going on: “It’s just so weird” and “It’s such a shame.” NHL deputy commissioner Bill Daly said that the crazy day had no effect on Kane’s status from the league’s standpoint. Kane didn’t travel with the Blackhawks to Detroit, but that wasn’t unusual: During preseason, not every player dresses for every game. He has been cheered throughout Chicago’s public training camp. This is not going away anytime soon. The NHL will start its season with its biggest American star on its most successful franchise in the epicenter of a story whose reverberations grow stronger and more destructive by the day. “It’s a circus sideshow,” you keep hearing, but it has become more like a depressing carnival ride. The nauseating ups and downs and upside-downs. The ominous loopiness and shady operators. The getting off, newly disoriented, right back at the same dirty, dingy place where you just got on. This post has been updated to remove an erroneous reference to Slava Voynov’s suspension by the NHL, which occurred after his arrest on domestic violence charges.  ",2015-09-24T15:41:23+00:00,NHL,Baker
23,Celebrating the Holy Marriage of Hockey and Doughnuts,"If you’re wondering why there are two off days between Games 1 and 2 of the Stanley Cup final, the rationale is simple. Clearly — and completely understandably — the league didn’t want to steal the spotlight from one of the most important days on the calendar: National Doughnut Day. Lest you think this is some newfangled celebration of #brands or a scheme cooked up by stealth Instagram lobbyists, National Doughnut Day dates back to 1938 and was created by the Salvation Army as a way to honor World War I veterans. (I like that Wikipedia throws deadpan shade on several competing doughnut holidays immediately before transitioning into a story about a POW camp in North Vietnam.) You may not know this, but hockey and doughnuts have a long and glorious history. Here’s a countdown of 10 of the most important hockey-doughnut crossovers in this crazy trip we call life. During the Los Angeles Kings’ run to their second Stanley Cup last season, “Los Angeles institution” Randy’s Donuts turned the “giant iconic donut that sits on the roof of the shop” into a large hockey puck. Ice girls handed out the confection to drivers-by, the Kings won the Cup, and … “the champion L.A. Kings did not stop in Inglewood during their victory parade through the South Bay.” … Oh. If the team never makes the playoffs again, you know what to blame for the curse. This little spiel about whether the discs of your spine better resemble a jelly doughnut or a hockey puck is best imagined being given by the doctors from either 30 Rock or Silicon Valley. Inspired by the treats he and his buddy used to get after hockey practice, Princeton graduate and former NHL journeyman Jeff Halpern is expanding his fried-chicken-’n’-doughnut food truck empire with a second physical outpost in Falls Church, Virginia, this summer. The Food Network deems it “pretty awesome,” while one blog commenter calls the offerings “freaking amazing … directly responsible for multiple food comas in my office.” We’re just going to work the former Boston Bruin and current Harvard men’s coach’s sorta-“doughnut”-sounding last name into this so that we have an excuse to link to this photo of Joe Thornton. Thanks to the fine men at something called Dude Perfect, we are treated to this footage of Tyler Seguin gettin’ dangly with a glazed doughnut. (That is not a euphamism, Cosmo be damned.) Style points for taking a chomp, although that’s also kinda gross.  It wouldn’t be a proper Lake Placid establishment without an important 1980 pun. I hope its offerings include Glazedruzione and Jelly Craig and the head chef is Bill Baker. Martin Brodeur is the NHL’s all-time leader in doughnuts, recording shutouts in 125 career games. (The next highest, Terry Sawchuk, had 103.) But none of them came in the infamous 2008 Rangers-Devils playoff series in which New York’s Sean Avery was so creatively annoying in front of Brodeur’s net that the NHL was moved to make a rules change in his (dis)honor. The bad blood between the two players continues to this day; when Brodeur called Avery’s short-lived appearance on Dancing With the Stars an embarrassment, Avery unleashed a Twitter tirade that began with calling Brodeur a fatso and concluded with a tweeted photo of a coffee and, yes, doughnut. (Like Avery’s career, the doughnut tweet is sadly no longer with us.)  Of course the biggest fast food chain (née doughnut purveyor) in Canada would be founded and named after a hockey player, the bruising defenseman Miles Gilbert “Tim” Horton. (Not sure how you get Tim from Miles Gilbert, but we’ll go with it.) Horton won four Stanley Cups with the Maple Leafs — that’s how you know it was a long time ago — was a seven-time All-Star, and at one point held the record for consecutive games by a defenseman. He died in a car crash in 1974, and the chain was bought out by his business partner. It is now owned by Burger King, with an assist from Warren Buffett. Recently, a decision by the store to stop running ads for an oilsands shipping company drew ire in “oil-friendly Alberta.” Oh, Canada. A play off Tim Hortons, Stan Mikita’s Donuts was Wayne’s World’s version of the Max — the cool diner where everything went down, from Wayne’s confrontation with pyscho hosebeast Stacy (are you mental?) to Garth’s Mister Donut Head Man death scene. (The scene features a policeman named Officer Koharski — but more on that in a bit.) Stan Mikita himself made a cameo in the film, but garnered less attention than did the 12-foot likeness of him that rotated atop the eponymous venue. Shortly after the film wrapped, Mikita got a phone call from Richard Dean Anderson, a.k.a. MacGyver, who said he’d seen the giant Stan at Paramount Studios and wished to own it. “I found out later that he brings it outside and plays street hockey with it,” Mikita said.  Wayne’s World’s Officer Koharski was an amazing reference to one of the most widely known officials in hockey lore, a man who was perched smack dab in the jelly center of the hockey-doughnut Venn diagram. Grantland’s Sean McIndoe has already done a perfect job of outlining the outlandish events of May 6, 1988, and thereafter, so we’ll just summarize it here. But, basically: Embittered New Jersey Devils coach Jim Schoenfeld jostles referee Don Koharski in an arena hallway following a bad Devils loss to the Bruins. Koharski delivers a verbal lifetime suspension. Schoenfeld, now an assistant GM with the Rangers, responds with the magical phrase “ya fell, ya fat pig” and the repeated exhortation, in a gorgeus Canadian accent, to “have another doughnut.” The drama continues with an impromptu referee walkout in the next game; the words “court injunction” and “Lou Lamoriello”; replacement refs that put the NFL’s fiasco to shame; and coaches threateningly wielding sticks. Schoenfeld later lamented that he “used English” in his passionate remarks — “if I had just said what most coaches would say, cursing, it would have all been deleted and unprintable and we wouldn’t be talking about it today,” he told the Hartford Courant for a 2004 article headlined “This Line Sticks Like Glaze.” But what would National Doughnut Day be if he hadn’t?! Like Sean, it both upsets me and calms me that this all went down in a land before Twitter. Someone should stage a full-scale reenactment sometime. This year’s playoffs are so lame.

24,"Pierre le Fou: The Giants, Jason Pierre-Paul, and Where We Are Now","Sunday night’s Giants-Cowboys game was riddled with shifting fortunes, uncertain outcomes, wastes of money, and idiotic, should-have-known-better, what-were-you-even-thinking mistakes. While it was painful for New York fans to watch a win slip bizarrely from their grasp, though, they really ought to be used to it by now: It’s something the franchise has been dealing with since the Fourth of July weekend. “Jason Pierre Paul rented out a whole uhal van full of fireworks and I’m currently scared for my houses safety,” tweeted a Floridian named Melissa on Independence Day, attaching a photo of boxes, marked with explosive symbols, stacked up haphazardly behind the window-stenciled words “Need a Van?” Her house remained ostensibly untouched, but the star Giants defensive end was not: Reports with phrases like “flesh missing” and “nerve damage” began trickling in the next day about a fireworks accident suffered by Pierre-Paul. “Early indications are, hand injury is not career threatening,” tweeted Adam Schefter on July 5. Three days later, though, he was posting a screenshot of a leaked medical record featuring the word “AMPUTATION.” The New York Giants knew that Pierre-Paul would be making a lot of headlines this offseason, but the team had assumed that most of them would revolve around the decision about whether to place the franchise tag on the 26-year-old pass-rusher, who racked up 12.5 sacks last season. While the decision wasn’t clear-cut, the Giants ultimately extended a reported $60 million long-term contract offer that Pierre-Paul coolly left on the table for months. In mid-June, he skipped minicamp workouts in an attempt to hold out for more money. “Skipping the workouts also helps him to avoid an injury,” explained the Associated Press’s Tom Canavan on June 16, “which would put a long-term contract at risk.” Man, those were the days. The accident itself was odd enough — the franchise’s deals with the devil may have brought the Giants two epic Super Bowl wins, but the cost has apparently been a gunshot to the leg and an explosion to the hand — but the ongoing drama has been even more strange. With the contractual relationship between Pierre-Paul and the Giants solidly in “It’s Complicated” status, the interactions between the two parties have become about as mind-fucky and opaque as those text messages we’ve all exchanged with that one on-again-off-again-on-again-off-again flame. Early on, with Pierre-Paul still laid up in the hospital, the Giants sent a peace- (and information-) seeking delegation down to Florida consisting of a trainer and former Giants linebacker and current “special assistant/consultant” Jessie Armstead. The pair hung around for two days, with Pierre-Paul refusing to see them, before giving up and heading back to New Jersey. Several weeks later, in a wide-ranging Q&A between Tom Coughlin and Sports Illustrated’s Jenny Vrentas, the Giants head coach — whose “How can I help you?” text to JPP the day after the accident was never answered — expressed frustration with the impasse. “I don’t know what they think they are hiding,” he said of Pierre-Paul’s camp. “It only makes us, me personally, think the worst.” Even after finally speaking with Pierre-Paul in early August, Coughlin didn’t gain much insight into the situation. “Do I know anything more than I did before?” he asked. “No.” It’s now mid-September, and we can make roughly the same assessment now as Coughlin did then. Last week, fleetingly optimistic reports that Pierre-Paul was hoping to take the field for Week 1 gave way to dark rumblings that he won’t be back this season whatsoever. According to Fox Sports’s Jay Glazer, Pierre-Paul felt he could play if outfitted with a club cast — like the one Green Bay linebacker Clay Matthews sported in 2013 — while the Giants took one look at his mangled paw (“worse than they were led to believe,” according to ESPN’s Dan Graziano) and sent him back to Florida to work out and gain weight, telling him to come back in six weeks. Round and round it goes, endless fodder for horrible puns and lulzy tailgate shenanigans. But despite the WTFness of it all, there’s a bleak method to everyone’s madness. With Pierre-Paul’s contract status as yet unsettled, his camp has had an incentive all summer to remain strategically vague. Information gleaned from the July hospital visit could have been used against him. The more recent stalling was likely a tactic to help Pierre-Paul avoid official relegation to the non-football injury list, which would carry with it strict deadlines and procedures that have to be followed. As for the Giants, they appear not yet ready to cut ties completely and risk losing a player who, even in his depleted state, still might turn out to be better than any of their other existing options.1 The Giants beat themselves up offensively Sunday in their horrifying 27-26 loss to the Cowboys, but in addition to all the dumb playmaking decisions and dropped passes, there was one constant, defensively, throughout the game: Tony Romo had all the time in the world. There were no uncaged beasts flying toward him, no threatening arms (or club hands) in his face, no hilarious GIFs of him being laid out helplessly on his rear end. Pierre-Paul’s absence had its own presence. Coughlin characterized Dallas’s final game-winning drive as “like a hot knife through butter” (hey, at least New York covered the spread?), but it remains sorta unclear whether to stick a fork in Pierre-Paul. We’ll have to wait at least another month, as we’ve been doing since July, for more information about whether he’s really, truly done. It’s safe to say, however, that this strange saga isn’t.",2015-09-15T09:02:37+00:00,NFL,Baker
25,Urban Renewal: The Return of David Wright,"Recently the food and restaurant website Eater featured a punishing yet courteous retrospective of Morimoto and Buddakan, two ostentatious expense-account-’n’-bachelor-party monstrosities that “were born in a different era,” having opened in 2006, “when New York was riding the tail end of its Second Gilded Age.” The city was turbo-charged back then; everyone just wanted in: to Meatpacking nightclubs, to at-capacity quantitative hedge funds, to preschools with panache, to Shea Stadium for the postseason.  Those playoffs represented the almost-culmination of a charmed season, of an era of superlatives. Earlier that year, in May, the New York Times’s Frank Bruni had declared Buddakan “the apotheosis, at least for the next 60 seconds, of a distinct genre: the post-millennial urban mess hall as supersize cocktail lounge with superstylized dishes.” Later that month, Sports Illustrated was similarly breathless in declaring 23-year-old Mets third baseman David Wright the Prince of the City: “a combination of talent, poise and personality that hasn’t been seen in a homegrown Met since Tom Seaver’s heyday in the 1970s.”  The article quoted a former coach of Wright as saying that “if you were going to start from scratch and design the perfect New York ballplayer, David is the kid you’d come up with.” It quoted a Mets chat room enthusiast describing him as “pure Eros and moonbeams,” which sounds like something cribbed from a pre-recession restaurant review.  ??? It’s nearly a decade later, and the New York Mets are trying to get back into the playoffs for the first time since that fall of 2006. On the one hand, if you’d told any Mets fan before this season that the team would hold first place in the NL East in the dog days of August, they’d eagerly take it: This was predicted to be a year of angling, of getting pieces in place, of letting Matt Harvey rediscover his form following Tommy John surgery and building thoughtfully from there. On the other hand, Mets supporters have grown conditioned to be wary of their franchise’s recent success. After the 2006 season, after all, came 2007, when the team blew a seven-game cushion in 17 games to miss the postseason — as it would for the next seven years. Still, the Mets’ play of late has been marked by a whimsical allure that has brought joy to even the most Eeyoresque of Amazin’ observers. Harvey has been supplemented and at times borderline supplanted by Jacob deGrom and Noah Syndergaard and their flowing, luscious locks. The trade deadline went from humiliating to holy shit with the tearful retention of Wilmer Flores and the rub-your-eyes pickup of Yoenis Cespedes. Even a recent slump failed to get anyone too down, coinciding as it did with a string of losses by the neck-and-neck Washington Nationals. The Mets, who earlier this season failed repeatedly to muster even a small bit of offense to support their pitching staff, have now scored 55 runs in their past five games. And perhaps the most significant of them all came off the bat of captain David Wright, a sentence that just a few months ago seemed unlikely to ever be uttered again. Wright hadn’t suited up for the Mets since being put on the DL with an increasingly mysterious injury in mid-April, and it seemed highly ominous when the Wall Street Journal’s Jared Diamond tweeted on June 2 that manager Terry Collins, Wright, and GM Sandy Alderson would address the media that evening. “Read what you will,” Diamond wrote, and it was hard not to read the worst. Wright’s diagnosis had shifted from a hamstring problem into spinal stenosis, a chilling pair of words that famously haunted guys like Don Mattingly and Lenny Dykstra and, last summer, ended the promising football career of then-23-year-old New York Giants running back David Wilson. But when the three men finally did speak on June 2, it was with decent news: While no timetable had been set for his return, Wright was expected to be back sometime this season. The return finally took place Monday, with the Mets in Philadelphia to play the lousy Phillies. In September 2013, Wright had come back (from another hamstring injury) at Citizens Bank Park to knock in a two-run homer in his first at-bat. And Monday, there was more where that came from. Before the seconds arrived, there was dessert. When the Mets got to their hotel for the Philly series, Wright was waiting, in full uniform, for everyone with a spread of locally baked cookies. (He said he considered wearing even his spikes for the presentation, but decided against it.) On Tuesday, the TV broadcast team noted that most players availed themselves of Wright’s offerings, but that deGrom opted for a room-service burger instead — a burger that ultimately “didn’t sit well with him.” The moral of the story: Always trust content, and confections, from David Wright. ??? Perhaps queasy from his meal, deGrom struggled uncharacteristically early in Monday’s game, and by the time Wright came to the plate to bat cleanup in the second inning, the Mets were already trailing 3-0. Wright proceeded to connect so squarely with the 1-1 pitch that if you were just arriving at the stadium you would be forgiven for assuming you were catching batting practice. The ball landed in the upper decks for a solo home run, and the roar inside the park from infiltrating South Jersey Mets fans made the place sound like a New York home game. By the end of the night, the Mets had set a new franchise record with eight single-game home runs and Wright had gone 2-for-5 with three runs scored. “I almost pulled a Wilmer Flores out there,” Wright later said of the emotional moment. It wasn’t a wholly perfect evening by any means for the captain, who in contrast to his offensive fireworks committed two errors at third base. (On Tuesday night, in another Mets comeback win over the Phillies, he looked shaky at third once more.) But it was beautiful nonetheless, one more lasting moment created by a guy who is the only real link to the last time the Mets did anything memorable. New York was a different city then — but then again, New York always is. Four years ago, Mets owner and Bernie Madoff money-loser Fred Wilpon sat with New Yorker writer Jeffrey Toobin and ran his mouth while taking in a game at Citi Field. “A really good kid,” he said of Wright, as the increasingly embattled third baseman came up to the plate. “A very good player. Not a superstar.” (In classic Wright fashion, he replied to the slight by saying that his parents had texted him that he would always be their superstar.)  Wilpon’s comment had some truth, but it created a minor firestorm; after all, this was before Wright opted to re-sign his lease. Ultimately, though, he agreed to a $138 million, eight-year deal through 2020 with the Mets, trusting that the team he’d grown up with would evolve for the better, would develop those blighted areas, would rebound once again. There are 37 games left, plenty of time for the Mets to blow it once more. Maybe they will, but if they do, it will feel out of character for this cast. Wright will never be the player he seemed likely to be in 2006, when everything within and around him was marked by limitless potential. But he’s the one player the team’s got who can remind everyone of that silly, giddy Second Gilded Age. There’s nothing more New York, after all, than the guy who has been there and done that, than the tenant who stubbornly refuses to budge.",2015-08-26T12:18:30+00:00,MLB,Baker
26,Say Good Night to the Bad Guys: An Appreciation of Late-Career A-Rod and Tiger Woods,"Imagine if sports fans ever turned our judgmental gazes inward. We drone on about concepts like sanctity and integrity like we’re Jesuit headmasters delivering a convocation, war stripes painted on our cheeks all the while. We tut-tut about greed and loyalty while browsing LinkedIn and Monster.com. We throw around the notion of “class” in so many permutations — he’s all class, you stay classy — that we’ve rendered it as meaningless as “hipster” or “troll.” If we ever held our own sports-related behavior to the same impossible standard that we do a general manager or a point guard, polite society would melt down. “You’re a bum!” we’d scream at ourselves in the mirror. We’d demand we be traded, maybe even hit with a lifetime ban. Everyone has booed a draft pick they later liked, or tiptoed onto a bandwagon and hoped no one would notice. Just like the coaches we rage against, we play weird favorites. If I took an unflinching self-inventory, if I catalogued my own shortcomings with the same rigor I’d use for complaining about Isiah Thomas or Lawrence Tynes, there’s an obvious weakness that would rise to the top. And it’s this: Outside the goes-without-saying elation of seeing my favorite teams win their respective championships, there are few things I can think of that would make me happier than Alex Rodriguez belting a game-winning homer late in October, or Tiger Woods sinking a putt on 18 to win one more major. (Though let’s be real, I’d gladly take even the Subprime-Mortgage-Backed-Security Open Presented by Fossil for the poor guy at this point.) Yes, in spite of their past shady dealings, notwithstanding their multimillions, I wish nothing but glad tidings and future glories upon A-Roid and the Lion Cheetah. I am more attached to their play than I am to the careers of bright, young up-and-comers, of genuine good guys. Maybe I’m just kinda classless that way. You should probably trade me. I’m a bum. ??? Remember when Tiger was a fresh-faced phenom from Stanford? He turns 40 in just a few months. A-Rod celebrated the big 4-0 with a home run last week against the Texas Rangers, the team that discarded him in 2004. He always did seem like the kind of guy who would splurge on a gift for himself. Both of these dudes have arrived at the life stage in which they are basically the rueful middle-aged pirate in the Jimmy Buffett song: I’ve done a bit of smugglin’ / I’ve run my share of grass / Made enough money to buy Miami / but I pissed it away so fast. They still possess plenty of that plunder, sure. But sports, just like maritime robbery, is an industry reliant on reputation, on bluster, on striking fear into hearts. Instead, A-Rod and Tiger, in recent years, have been the ones walking the plank. Consider A-Rod. If there’s any athlete who has recently come closest to a Cersei Lannister–style “Shame! Shame! Shame! [clang]” perp walk, it’s him. His reckoning has been very public, very prolonged — and very much his own fault. Like other players, A-Rod ingested forbidden potions and dabbled in certain dark arts. But he also associated with the sort of seedy lowlifes who proudly hang out at South Florida tanning salons — not quite the world’s most discreet demographic. (Though when you consider some of the photo shoots A-Rod has been involved in over the years, getting involved with these folks was probably as close as he’s ever gotten to truly finding his tribe.) It’s no wonder everything blew up, and in his case it did so spectacularly: an explosion of pure, uncut UV rays. The story of A-Rod’s last decade is the story of pretty much anything, a grab bag of drama. There were years of rumors and innuendos about PEDs; high-profile girlfriends hand-feeding popcorn; sociopathic interviews with Katie Couric and Mike Francesa; “a yellowish envelope” stuffed with cash; nicey-nice Goldman Sachs interventions; auxiliary characters like “Bobby from Boca”; enough high-powered lawyers to bat around the order; and, as the cherry on top, a suspension for the entirety of the 2014 season. The man is a tabloid editor’s wildest dream. Most human beings would wilt under the glare of any one of these subplots, and for a long time it felt like perhaps A-Rod was collapsing under all of their cumulative weight. He played only 44 games in the 2013 season, one marred by injury and such deteriorating and hostile relations with the Yankees that GM Brian Cashman was moved to tell ESPN New York that “Alex should just shut the fuck up.” In many ways it has actually helped A-Rod’s image that his greatest nemesis is his own organization, the one that re-upped him on a 10-year contract in 2007 and has frantically combed through it for loopholes ever since. There’s something pretty delicious about seeing the Yankees — a franchise that prides itself on its staid pinstriped perfection, that looks everyone in the eye and asks them solemnly why can’t they be more like Derek Jeter — reduced to being a Costanza-era caricature of itself. There were the accusations that the team Twitter feed froze A-Rod out during spring training. There was the infighting over milestone-linked contractual bonuses that made the Yankees look petty, regardless of whether they had a point. There was the sickeningly sweet resolution, which included the gritted-teeth glorification of one dipshit fan. There’s always something, and I can’t get enough. It sustains me. If I could somehow inject it into my bloodstream, I could go out there and belt a home run. I root for A-Rod because I root for the rare holy trinity of hilarity, comeuppance, and spite that wafts around him like a cloud of cologne. I could not agree more with every brilliant word of Grant Brisbee’s prescient ode to the man from the beginning of this year: If he were a wrestler, he’d be Oblivious Ted DiBiase, and he’d take an extra moment to preen and soak up the boos, but he can’t quite pull that off. He isn’t cartoonish enough; there’s just enough humanity and need to be loved to make him something a little too real, even as he’s made up of intentionally artificial everything-else. Baseball functions just fine without this sort of player, but isn’t there just a little extra excitement when the Yankees come to town? Yes, there is. And there’s a lot of extra excitement for actual Yankees fans, too: The team is somehow doing well, and A-Rod and his 24 home runs are an undisputed part of its success. He hit three homers in a three-run win a couple of weeks ago, then another on the night he turned 40 last week. A few nights after that he went out to dinner and the whole restaurant serenaded him. All was right with the world. ??? A-Rod’s 2015 season is nothing but gravy, really. If he were having a bad year, or even a nondescript one, I wouldn’t be particularly upset. I’m a fair-weather A-Rod enthusiast, one in it as much for the sideshow as for the main event. When it comes to Tiger Woods, though, that is unfortunately not the case. It’s not even that I was some “get in the hole!”-screaming superfan during Tiger’s increasingly distant prime. I appreciated his greatness just fine; I loved that one Nike commercial in which he juggled the ball on the face of his club, black pants billowing in the breeze. Watching him play, I probably made more frequent note of the enormousness of his pecs and biceps than I did the artistry of his shots. I took it for granted that he’d just keep making ’em, that he’d set all the records, that the fists would pump on pumpin’ on. I have super-fond memories of that first Masters when he won by a dozen strokes in that dopey red sweater, but I can’t reminisce offhand, in hushed tones, about particular putts he sank; I never really knew I should be storing them in my mind. That ho-hum innocence is something I’ll never get back. These days I’m far more tuned in, and it’s not good for the soul. When Tiger hits a bad shot — and ugh, he does, all the time — I’m alarmed by how much it harshes my buzz. When he has a bad round — and ugh, when doesn’t he? — it drags on my day, regardless of how well other golfers are playing. It’s not that I watch the sport only for Tiger; far from it. I’ve enjoyed this year’s tournaments (even and especially that bizarro steampunk U.S. Open that was held on what appeared to be a paintball arena designed to resemble the set of Mad Max) as much as I ever have in years past. I’ve been totally charmed by young Jordan Spieth discussing how he and his buddies played the British Open on a golf simulator before he got to Scotland. I could barely stomach Dustin Johnson missing that birdie putt at Chambers Bay as Wayne Gretzky looked on. I can barely stomach Bubba Watson in general. The cast of characters in golf at the moment is as varied and compelling as it’s been in quite some time. And yet Tiger is still the one chewing up all the scenery. It’s difficult to look away from his sad attempts at stringing together 72 mostly good holes, his futile efforts to conquer such a whack-a-mole sport. (Short game under control? Time to miss every fairway. Tee shots looking good? Great, your putting’s a mess.) It’s an enormous bummer to watch. In an essay he wrote last month after Tiger strode into the British Open full of confidence only to slink out in tatters days later, ESPN’s Kevin Van Valkenburg called attention to the willful blindness of Tiger fans, how we parrot the player’s own constant insistence that it’s all coming together, that things are finally falling into place, that he can do it — no, really this time. A 17th place finish at the Masters, or a 32nd place finish at the Greenbrier Classic, is not enough to suggest he’s close to winning. You can delude yourself into believing those tournaments represent real progress, that they’re evidence he’ll reinvent himself and make one more run at Nicklaus, but it’s a fantasy. It’s a testament to how great he truly was that he makes you forget his bad golf so quickly. When he shows up at the PGA Championship in August, people will forget how poorly he played at The Open and convince themselves he can contend, right up to the point where he shoots 78. This weekend, most of the notable players in the golf world are preparing for the Bridgestone Invitational. Not Tiger, who is in the strange position of being just about as notable as they come — while also being ranked 262nd in the world, not high enough to qualify for the event. “Which is kind of interesting,” he remarked Monday during a press conference, “because I’ve won Bridgestone, what, eight times, and I’m not eligible.” During the Q&A Tiger was barraged, as he always is these days, with questions that all got at the same theme: basically, Tough times, eh? Ever think about giving it up? One person asked about all the unsolicited advice he must hear wherever he goes. “Yeah, I’ve had a lot,” he agreed, and laughed as he added that “just like a body part, everyone has an opinion.” He’s heard it all, he said: He should quit, he should retire, he sucks, he needs to swing slower, he needs to make more putts. “I’ve had people at restaurants say, ‘Hey, all you need to do is just eat a little bit better, and you’ll feel better, and that’ll make you play better,’” he said. “I’m like, ‘OK, great, I’m having fish and broccoli. How much better does it get than this?’” ??? The problem is, it basically doesn’t. For A-Rod and Tiger, things have already gotten as good as they’ll get. Even the eff-you satisfaction of a late-stage comeback doesn’t really set anyone free; just recently, David Ortiz said-but-didn’t-say that maybe A-Rod’s doing well these days because he’s cheating again. As these guys contemplate 40, I have reached a strange age myself, at least when it comes to being a fan: Athletes are no longer people I look up to, and that’s not just because of my job. The vast majority of the world’s top physical specimens are now younger — often much younger — than me. Meanwhile, the people who are my contemporaries or a bit older are the ones I feel like I’ve grown up alongside, start to (impending) finish. I remember when Venus, with her bright, clacking beads, was the preeminent Williams sister; I think about a skinny, smiling Kobe Bryant going with Brandy to prom. My understanding of Major League Baseball has always been one in which A-Rod was a prominent and polarizing star. This vantage point provides perspective and also freedom: I’m no longer held under anyone’s spell. I can’t get let down by my idols because I don’t have any. (OK, if Eli Manning revealed a dark secret, I’d be crushed, but that’s it.) It’s sort of like reaching the age when you realize your parents are just a couple of folks giving it their best shot in a challenging world. I’m far more intrigued by the guys who have gone through hell than the golden gods. A-Rod and Tiger, though they’ve both had similar trajectories in many ways, are at the moment very different beasts. A-Rod grabs my attention because he’s so larger than life, such a totally out-of-this-realm cartoon character that he is not entirely to be believed. Every wacky photo of him cracks me up; every successful at-bat is like an old man who has given up on decorum hollering at a cloud, Colonel Ludlow post-stroke slurring “screw ’em!” at the world at large. He’s an aspirational weirdo, a guy who knows nothing of normal. Tiger is the opposite. He’s grown so very small lately, his problems have become so mundane, that watching him play golf can be a little too real, can dovetail a little too nicely with the frustrations of civilian life. The cursing, the disappointed sighs, the overthinking, the missed gimme putts, the shots that you know are bad before the ball has even left your club face. Even his smiles have a sarcastic wariness to them; true delight has become so much more valuable, and also so rare. It’s hard to know what’s worse: that Tiger has become so unrecognizable, or that he’s become so easy to recognize. What makes elite athletes so compelling isn’t usually their best stuff, it’s what happens to them when they can’t rely on that stuff to define them anymore. “Once I stopped believing I could win a major,” Andy Roddick admitted in a raw Q&A with the New York Times in June, “I didn’t want to continue.” I thought about that when I saw something Tiger said Monday: “There comes a point in time in every athlete’s career where you know that your best isn’t good enough anymore, and I’m definitely not at that point yet.” Some observers may raise an eyebrow at that, but I’d like to believe he’s onto something, no really this time. It’s easy to point out that guys like Tiger and A-Rod deserve no one’s sympathy, that they’re classless narcissists who violated sanctity and integrity and deserve to reap what they’ve sown. Maybe so, but really, who isn’t? Just as I can’t really temper my emotions when the Rangers lose a Game 7, another part of being so fascinated by sports and athletes is that oftentimes I’m drawn like a moth to the people who are all up in flames. I’m not proud of it, but as these guys might say: It just is what it is. And honestly? It’s just more fun this way, even when it’s also more grim. It’s all on a case-by-case basis, though, I should note. I don’t lend my mad love to just anyone. Tom Brady, for example? That guy’s a total bum.",2015-08-06T09:44:27+00:00,D-Bags,Baker
27,Praise the Lloyd: Carli and Team USA Put on a Show in Vancouver,"We were barely a sixth of the way through the Women’s World Cup final and we had run out of “is this really happening?” facial expressions. We stared at each other, jaws slack, wondering if the American flag temporary tattoos that were scattered around all the bathroom sinks at Vancouver’s BC Place weren’t laced with something. Sixteen minutes had passed and everything felt altered: The score was 4-0, the air was thick with a smoky haze, and we’d witnessed not only a hat trick, but one that included a goal scored all the way from midfield. More 2015 Women’s World Cup Put Up the Third Star: Six Key Figures From the USWNT’s World Cup Triumph 2-0: The U.S. Women Exorcise Their World Cup Demons in the City of Saints The USWNT Beats Germany: This Team Is Good, and It Should Be Good for a Long Time Canadian Bacon: Watching the U.S. Women Bring Home a Win in Edmonton ‘Did Abby Score?’ The USWNT and the Weight of Expectation at the Women’s World Cup Canada to America and Back Again: Sydney Leroux’s Journey to the World Cup Julie Johnston Is the Most Important Player on the USWNT The USWNT Has More Attacking Talent Than Any Team in the World, and That’s a Good Thing … Right? For the USWNT to Win, This Still Needs to Be Abby Wambach’s World Cup Soccer has always been the guest who arrives right on time, wine in hand — its pregame anthems are brisk and the kickoff takes place precisely when the invitation says it will. But in this U.S.-Japan game, a rematch of both the 2011 World Cup final and the Olympic gold-medal contest a year later, that fastidious punctuality was taken to an extreme. Anyone who had gone to grab a beer in the early going wound up missing the party of the century. The night’s guest of honor was Carli Lloyd, an eccentric South Jersey native whose commitment to distraction-free focus is such that she banned her fiancé from attending the match. Her three goals in the first 16 minutes in front of a heavily American crowd (sample sign: “I LIKE MY SUSHI DEEP-FRIED. #MURICA”) left fans reeling in maniacal disbelief. Lloyd’s first goal was what happens when an unstoppable force meets a movable object. She barreled in from outside 20 yards like a perturbed bull, and the result was something out of Terry Tate, office linebacker, or that recent Vine of a dude being body-slammed out of a canoe. Two minutes later, she scored again, this time off a free kick. And after Lauren Holiday put the U.S. ahead 3-0 when she took advantage of the understandably rattled Azusa Iwashimizu’s ill-advised up-for-grabs header, Lloyd struck a third time, this time in a way that was trippy even for a place with medicinal marijuana dispensaries all over town. It was like watching a video game character already lit up by a “She’s on fire!” flame, enhanced even further with a cheat code. Lloyd didn’t pause to brush dirt off her shoulder, or blow on her fingernails, or coolly pull off a standing backflip, but she didn’t need to. The goal — all three goals — was already all of those things put together. “Audacious,” is how Megan Rapinoe would describe it. “Bodacious” would work, too. For the millions of viewers back in the States watching the game on Fox in bars and living rooms, there were two eternally lasting images of this unpredictable and inexplicable first half: (1) Lloyd’s post-goal primal screams, and (2) an eagle-headed woman in a blue U.S. Soccer kit pumping her fists in the stands and menacingly flapping her American flag wings. Just hours earlier, though, even that aggressive masked eagle had been just like the rest of us: standing at the bar, describing herself as “anxious.” ??? Dennis Grombkowski/Getty Images “When I wear the eagle head, no one notices,” said Rhiannon O’Harra, laughing, several hours before kickoff as she sat at Doolin’s Irish Pub in downtown Vancouver, the official pregame meeting place of the American Outlaws. She and her recent fiancée, Kelly Farrell, were in matching American flag spandex pants, but it was Farrell getting all the attention — her 6-foot-1 height made that giant bald eagle mask highly visible above the packed crowd. “I found it online,” Farrell said. “Just Googled ‘bald eagle mask.’” Also representing the winged kingdom at the gathering was a guy in a similar mask wearing a stars-and-stripes suit and someone dressed up as a turkey standing on a windowsill and boogieing for the benefit of the people standing in line outside. Farrell, who along with O’Harra competes in a Los Angeles roller derby league called the Derby Dolls — Hurt LockHer is her stage name — used to play goalie for Xavier University’s soccer team. She and O’Harra decided more than a year ago to book tickets and flights to Vancouver for the World Cup final, figuring there was a good chance the U.S. team would make it. “We were making a big gamble,” Farrell said. “When we saw the [group round] bracket come out, we were like, well, we hope they make it through!” When I asked if she was nervous about Japan, she thought for a moment and said the better word would be “anxious.” Across the bar, a group of American Outlaws leaders sat at a table hollering chants; one of them, Phoenix chapter vice-president Ryan Shirah, was dressed as George Washington and banging happily on a drum. He showed me photos of him and his girlfriend, Megan, both of whom had gone to a party the night before dressed as Julie Johnston, complete with sky-blue headbands and blonde wigs. Nearby, a group of about six or eight guys, in various states of patriotic dress and face paint, huddled around a table as part of the bachelor party weekend celebration for their buddy Dimitri Perera. They’d come to Vancouver on Thursday night, most of them from Seattle. Last year, after getting into the men’s World Cup frenzy, Perera had looked up the women’s competition, said, “Oh shit, it’s in Canada!” and asked his fiancée, Elizabeth, if she wanted to go to a game. She suggested he make a bachelor party out of it. In the month leading up to the weekend, the trip’s expected epicness levels — and thus Perera’s moods — rose and fell with the performance of the U.S. women. “During the group stage I was super-depressed,” Perera said, referring to the U.S. team’s subpar play early in the tournament, which caused many to assume they’d be knocked out well before the final. During the semifinal game against Germany, he said, he’d been stuck in a meeting, reduced to sneaking peeks at text-message updates from his fiancée’s cousin, NamThien Vu. He pumped his fist silently at the news that Celia Sasic had missed a penalty kick, and as soon as the meeting ended he ran to a bar across the street to catch the final 10 minutes. Now he and his friends were in Vancouver, having a hell of a time, and the match hadn’t even begun. ??? About two hours before kickoff, the bar began clearing out for the 10-block march to BC Place. When I took part in the march in Edmonton before the group of 16 match against Colombia, we were a ragtag crew of misfits that filled one, maybe one and a half subway cars en route to the stadium. This time, it was a cast of thousands that almost entirely shut down a main Vancouver thoroughfare, save for a few intrepid buses that inched their way through. “Our house,” a few marchers hooted, “in the middle of our street.” People on the sidewalk paused to take pictures of the stream of fans, from the women dressed as three gold stars to the parents and their kids conga-line dancing up the block to the gals holding huge hand-markered portraits of various members of the national team with faces contorted into screams. It was like a day-late Fourth of July parade hopped up on Red Bull and amphetamines; what it lacked in a procession of antique cars it made up for in enormous foam cutouts of players’ heads. At the entrance to BC Place, security guards politely asked fans to check their selfie sticks at the gate while protesters held up small signs seeking to “End the Ban on Women in Stadiums in Iran.” Inside the building, the signs were less politically charged: WISH I COULD PLAY LIKE A GIRL, one said. ALEX MORGAN IS BAE, read another. And, most presciently: PRAISE THE LLOYD. ??? Dennis Grombkowski/Getty Images The semifinal game against Germany had been a nail-biting affair; even when the U.S. took the lead, there was the sense that one false move could spell trouble. That’s exactly what had happened in the 2011 World Cup final, when twice the Americans took a step up on Japan, and twice Japan evened the score. When Japan won the championship in penalty kicks, the oh-so-marketable faces of the U.S. team — Alex Morgan, Abby Wambach — were helpless and stricken, their eyes big with the unanswered whys and hows. Last night’s game was bonkers, and madcap, and almost entirely tension free. It’s telling that the scariest moments came when an own goal by Johnston narrowed the U.S. lead to a still-dominant 4-2 — accounting for the first two goals the Americans’ strong defense had given up since the opening game of the tournament — and it’s even more telling that the score remained that way for all of two minutes before Tobin Heath scored to give the U.S. a three-goal lead again. The healthy cushion allowed for some touching theater at the game’s end. Megan Rapinoe was taken out for Kelley O’Hara, and she beamed and clapped at the crowd as she trotted off the field. Abby Wambach went in, and when she did, Lloyd ran up to her, ripped the captain’s armband off her own biceps, and wrapped it onto Wambach with lovely ceremonial deference. (Speaking of which, the small dap between Wambach and Japan’s elder stateswoman, Homare Sawa, playing in her sixth and final World Cup, was the sweetest example of mutual courtesy and respect between two legends that I’ve seen outside a tennis court.) And with a few minutes left, 40-year-old Christie Rampone, the only member of the team to have been on the field the last time the U.S. won the World Cup, in 1999, was put into the match to happy chants and major applause. Much is (properly) made of that 1999 team, with its household names that still endure — when ESPN’s Julie Foudy took her press seat just in front of the section I was sitting in, parents pointed her out to their kids and she was showered with cheers — and its cinematic, shirt-stripping finish. Last night’s game may not have ended in edge-of-your-seat penalty kicks, but it had everyone out of their chairs long before. It was not so much a competition as it was a coronation. ??? Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images At the game’s end, Wambach hugged and kissed her wife as the latter hung happy and limp from the stands. Defenders Becky Sauerbrunn and Meghan Klingenberg did a lap around the stadium with a flag flying between them. Rapinoe engaged in a long group hug with two Japanese players, then stood in line waiting for her medal and totally breaking it down to a song whose lyrics proclaimed, Baby I’m worth it. The only drag was the line of vixens in slinky black dresses on hand to present the medals. There’s still progress to be made, but at last it was clear to everyone who had watched that the game itself was the true eye candy. Ambient smoke from a forest fire outside Vancouver had been clouding the city all day long, and it cast onto one corner of the stadium a late-day golden haze. Things only got more strange as the crowd gleefully booed a cadre of FIFA officials (sans Sepp Blatter, that canny coward) who took the field to hand out the trophies. Alex Morgan pulled on a champions T-shirt and pointed proudly to the third star on the chest. Rampone, to whom the captain’s armband had at some point been transferred by Wambach, brought her daughters up to the podium for photos while a group of players made snow angels with Shannon Boxx’s kid in piles of gold confetti, romping in the glittering riches like ponytailed Scrooge McDucks. Joe and Jill Biden took the field to congratulate players; the big video screen caught the veep exclaiming “Holy mackerel!” to a few of the women. I’m 32 years old, and I grew up in a town whose high school eschewed football in favor of soccer and soccer only. And still, it wasn’t until I was in fifth grade that an all-girls travel team was finally formed; before that, if you were any good, you had to try out to play with the boys. The kids in the stands at BC Place last night, and the ones watching at home, have grown up in a different era, one in which the existence of women’s sports in the U.S. is a baseline assumption and not something innovative and new. The only thing missing for them was recent proof of the system working the way it should. They have that now, and more importantly they have role models, in Lloyd and in her teammates, of women who apologize to no one for who they are and how they do. Slowly, one by one, the U.S. players finally left the field and headed to the locker room. They’d shown up to the party right on time, and now they were leaving with confetti stuck to their butts and the world’s finest goodie bags hanging from their necks — the sign of a pretty baller fiesta. The night was still young, and the real celebration was only beginning.",2015-07-06T14:51:12+00:00,Soccer,Baker
28,2-0: The U.S. Women Exorcise Their World Cup Demons in the City of Saints,"If you’re in the market for discarded chairs and unwanted dressers, I suggest you hurry on up to Montreal. All along the residential side streets just off the various main drags — with their sinful bakeries and efficient, indulgent delis and thankfully omnipresent bureaus de change — garbage bags and pieces of once-loved furniture decorate the sidewalks, slowly rotting in the summer rain. You can see several-story staircases right behind the orphaned items; you can understand the effort that this abandonment required.

For the USWNT to Win, This Still Needs to Be Abby Wambach’s World Cup For most Canadians, July 1 is Canada Day: a day of leisure, of sitting back and watching Bob McKenzie discuss the opening of NHL free agency on TV. But for the citizens of Montreal, July 1 is Moving Day, and the people aren’t just watching athletes uproot their lives for greener pastures; they’re carrying out the process themselves. For reasons once based on practicality that now linger out of a sort of nostalgic stubbornness — yep, sounds like Quebec — July 1 has long been designated in Montreal as a communal day of relocation, of taking inventory of your possessions and sorting what you need from what you don’t and getting the keys to a new apartment or lease on life. And this atmosphere of moving on, of not looking back, sure must be pervasive: Last night, on the eve of this upheaval, its spirit even managed to permeate the Women’s World Cup. ??? Stuart Franklin/FIFA “This is gonna be a lot of sad people later,” remarked one pessimistic U.S. women’s national team diehard as he glanced around the “Fan Zone” set up outside Montreal’s Olympic Stadium in advance of Tuesday night’s semifinal match between the USA, the tournament’s no. 2 team, and Germany, its no. 1. All around us were happy Americans in stars-and-stripes leggings and Alex Morgan jerseys and red-white-and-blue false eyelashes and Uncle Sam hats. They had driven up from Connecticut and flown in from Salt Lake City. If they’d had tails, they would be wagging. We regarded them with gloom. His remark was of a piece with much of the chatter I’d been hearing since I’d arrived in Montreal. The Germans were simply tactically superior, I was informed when, ignorant and chipper, I asked for pregame predictions. The Americans were doomed. USA coach Jill Ellis was too stodgy; her lineups were all wrong. Abby Wambach ruled the roost as a self-interested dictator; the signs were clear. Maybe the score would be 2-1, or maybe it would be 3-0; either way, the Germans would advance, and Team USA would go home, and it would all be indicative of the systemic issues plaguing the women’s U.S. Soccer program. I’m not lying when I say that at one point the word “sheeple” was said to me with a straight face in regard to optimistic fans. One fan told me she was torn: She wanted the U.S. to win, yet she didn’t want its faulty process to be rewarded. It was heavy stuff, a far cry from the upbeat and patriotic marketing that had constituted the bulk of my previous exposure to the team. (The night before the game, I went to U.S. Soccer’s “FanHQ” party, which was basically a nightclub populated by 12-year-olds and their parents. People did the Cupid Shuffle with zero self-consciousness and responded enthusiastically to an “I BELIEVE THAT SHE WILL WIN” prompt by the DJ. Like the $4 cup of water I got at the cash bar, it was both grotesque and refreshing.) It was also the kind of talk that you routinely hear about men’s professional teams and don’t think much of. I decided to consider the second-guessing and the preemptive woe as a sign of progress and true buy-in. An hour before the game, though, the mood lightened: The lineups had been released, and Wambach was on the bench. She hadn’t started in the quarterfinal game against China, either, but most assumed — based in part on Ellis’s suggestion a day earlier that “winning the aerial battle” would be important in Tuesday’s game — that she’d be back, crowding out more dynamic and explosive options. Instead, Ellis’s lineup featured just one true striker, Morgan, and implemented a flexible, midfielder-heavy formation that left even my naysaying pals upbeat. I took my seat inside Olympic Stadium — the blobby, quilted roof and the bright-ass lights combining to make everything feel like a particularly trippy circus — and, surrounded by dads and daughters, finally allowed myself to feel some hope. ??? Steve Bardens/FIFA Being inside a particularly biased arena is like growing up in a particularly biased household: You create your own realities and it’s not entirely your fault. When U.S. defender Julie Johnston was yellow-carded for putting hands on Alexandra Popp in the box about 14 minutes into the still 0-0 second half, the crowd screamed in displeasure and disbelief, and I believed both emotions to be valid and true. The big screen on one end of the field showed zero replays of what had happened, and it had happened far away from me, so for all I knew the ref had botched the call and given a gift to Germany in the form of a surefire penalty kick. Later, when a rare ray of Internet penetrated the Olympic Stadium roof and my Twitter finally updated, I learned that not only was it actually a penalty but that the color of the card should probably have been red. The German team had yet to miss one of these opportunities, and the crowd fell silent. An older Richard Dreyfuss doppelgänger wearing a T-shirt boasting a giant stuck-out tongue painted like an American flag and a hat that said BROOKLYN was pictured on the big screen looking stricken. The United States had mostly dominated play throughout the first half, and arguably should have been leading but for a golden chance by Morgan that was swallowed up by aptly named Deutsch goalie Nadine Angerer. (“She had the entire goal,” a guy behind me who must be fun at youth games lectured to his daughters, “and she did what you guys do: She kicked it right at her.”) And now the ball was at Celia Sasic’s feet — now this. Goalie Hope Solo, with that deliberate, Serena Williams–style nonchalance — so infuriating, so brilliant — took her sweet, sweet time sidling toward the goal, icing the kicker with her glacial pace. Sasic missed the net entirely, raising her hands up to her head in frustration pretty much the moment the ball left her foot. If you were in the concourse buying popcorn, the resulting “thunderclap of noise,” as Philly.com’s Jonathan Tannenwald put it, would have led you to believe the U.S. had scored a goal. About eight minutes later, the U.S. did. Morgan dove over the 18-yard line like a running back striving for a first down, and the whistle blew, and a yellow card was awarded. Carli Lloyd took the line for a penalty kick and the U.S. took the lead. Every time one stands up and sits back down, the seats at Olympic Stadium slam shut and then slam back open. In the first half, that had been the repeated sound effect of anticipation followed by disappointment, thousands of mechanical welps. After the goal, it sounded more like a gladiator arena full of Game of Thrones–size giants clapping in delight. Once again, it was only later that I would see the replays and realize that the inside-the-box spotting of the penalty was at best an iffy call. ??? NICHOLAS KAMM/AFP In the 75th minute, Ellis substituted in Kelley O’Hara for Tobin Heath at midfield, one of many moves on Tuesday night that earned a curt nod of approval from even her harshest critics. Nine minutes later, a gorgeous pass from Lloyd across the goalmouth was knocked in with a flying karate kick by O’Hara for an insurance strike, and despite a few late efforts by the Germans, the game was effectively sealed. Adjacent to Olympic Stadium is Montreal’s botanical garden. This time of year the stunning, fragrant lilacs have all dried up, but the acres of roses are in full bloom. At the whistle, Megan Rapinoe ran on the field and picked up Becky Sauerbrunn, the unsung defender whose steady vision and calm presence is what allows a looser cannon like Johnston to do her thing, like a tree that prospers in the shelter of another. Morgan Brian and Johnston hugged and held each other at arm’s length, two of the team’s young and promising difference-makers screaming into each other’s faces, while behind them fans with flags (including a couple of rainbows) draped their happy bodies so far over the restraining wall that it’s a wonder they didn’t plummet. Wambach, who had finally been subbed in at the game’s 80th minute, ran rampant through her teammates like a mama bear, tousling heads and shaking shoulders. It’s a role for which she’s simply best suited at this late stage of her undeniably incredible career. And somewhere out there in the surrounding city, on the night before Moving Day, people surveyed the scenes in their apartments. They made the tough decisions about what to pack and what to haul out to the curb to be scavenged by thrifty students or spirited away in garbage trucks as U.S. Soccer fans packed their bags for the final in Vancouver. There’s always something next. “Does this spark joy?” is what trendy Japanese organizational expert Marie Kondo says to ask yourself about each item in your home. If the answer is “not really,” you’re supposed to thank it sincerely for its service and walk away without ever turning back. It is nothing personal, truly: That sofa on the sidewalk lived a good life, that bedside table was a trusty and entirely nonjudgmental longtime companion. It will be hard and weird to live without them, but it will be better, too. It was time for them to go, because life goes on.",2015-07-01T12:37:19+00:00,2015 Women's World Cup,Baker
29,We Went There: The Darkness of Defeat in the Tampa Bay Locker Room,"Whether it’s a college roommate’s stereo or the adjacent room in a hotel, no one ever wants to listen to someone else’s loudly muffled music playing through a shared wall. But those late-night annoyances are trivial compared to the heartbreak of sitting stricken in a visitor’s locker room at an arena, having just lost the Stanley Cup, and hearing the unmistakeable on-and-on-and-on-and-onnnnn of “We Are the Champions” being blasted for someone else. More 2015 NHL Playoffs All our coverage right here! “I feel like we could be on that ice right now celebrating,” remarked Ben Bishop, the Tampa Bay Lightning goaltender who had just made 30 saves in a 2-0 defeat by the Chicago Blackhawks in Game 6. Playing through a partially torn groin, Bishop regularly stretched his long legs sideways for pad saves that made you wince in secondhand discomfort last night. When he went down to the ice, he needed to use his arms to stand back up. He didn’t let in any goals through 37 minutes, not until Chicago’s Duncan Keith jumped on his own rebound and gave the Blackhawks a 1-0 lead. A season after a Vezina Trophy nomination, and a playoff run that left the Lightning two wins away from their wildest dreams, had ended in physical and emotional pain. “It’s been fun,” Bishop said, his normally bright eyes vacant. “But it’s not that fun right now.” Across the room, circled by camera crews and writers with pained expressions, Lightning captain Steven Stamkos was similarly blunt. His eyes were ringed and red, and they watered. His voice was thin. “It makes you sick to your stomach,” he said. “We played, what, 26 [playoff games]? That’s a lot of hockey. It almost feels like it’s for nothing. I know it’s not, but that’s what it feels like. You’re playing through so many different things, guys on the team sacrificing … people don’t even have a clue what some guys are playing through and it seems like all for naught.” Stamkos, who didn’t score a goal in the final, kept repeating that he’d been feeling great that night. He kept returning to all the chances that hadn’t been converted to a championship. That evening alone he’d hit a post and been stuffed on a breakaway by Corey Crawford. His coach, Jon Cooper, said he felt sick for the guy. “I know he’s going to put a bunch of weight on his shoulders of why we didn’t score,” Cooper said. “Nobody scored. It wasn’t just Stammer.” Jonathan Drouin wept into a Gatorade towel, then balled it up and gnawed on it; he declined through tears to speak to the press. Anton Stralman took off his shirt but stopped there, stunned, his lower pads still on. Bishop put his head in his hands and stayed like that for a long time. Victor Hedman shuffled around the room embracing anyone he encountered, from teammates to lost-in-thought equipment staff. Cedric Paquette sat down on a folding chair, was quiet for a moment, then took off his hat and spiked it on the floor. Most of the Lightning players stayed in the showers, where the water might drown out the nearby sounds of Chicago’s whooping celebration, their third in six years, an embarrassment of riches that frankly seemed unfair. Out there, the Blackhawks were posing for photos and setting squirmy babies into the bowl of the iconic trophy for moments the kids would never remember but their parents would always have.1 ",2015-06-16T11:27:44+00:00,NHL,Baker
30,How to Sell a Stadium in Six Easy Steps: Calgary Gets the High-Pressure Pitch,"Two weeks ago, as the New York Times published a feature about how the new (and stadium-seeking) owners of the Milwaukee Bucks were “a case study in all that is wrong with our arena-shakedown age,” the folks behind Calgary Sports and Entertainment Corporation were putting the finishing touches on a grand new stadium proposal of their own. On August 18, CSEC CEO and Calgary Flames president Ken King and his associates announced their vision for a project dubbed CalgaryNEXT, a multibuilding, multiuse facility that would replace Calgary’s current aging athletic infrastructure and serve as a home to four local hockey, football, and lacrosse franchises. The announcement was fortuitously timed: This spring the Calgary Flames, buoyed by a corps of young, dynamic players (and a lot of luck), fought their way into the Stanley Cup playoffs and upset the Vancouver Canucks in the first round. The Calgary Stampeders of the Canadian Football League entered this season as the reigning Grey Cup champions. With excitement about last season breeding anticipation for this coming one, it was an opportune moment for CSEC to lay out its plans. In this rancher city of just over a million people, a place known for its annual Stampede rodeo and its NHL arena called the Saddledome, CalgaryNEXT has the makings of a wild horse that won’t be tamed. That’s how these new arena imaginings typically tend to go, anyway, and this one seems no different so far. Pretty architectural renderings that likely bear little similarity to what might actually take shape? Check. A small upfront private investment that is but a drop in the multiple buckets of suggested public funding? Check. A name with precious syntax? Check. (Edmonton, another Albertan city to Calgary’s north, currently leads the pack on this front, having recently released marketing materials banning the use of the word “the” in conjunction with its planned Ice District.) Ecological snafus and the word “retractable” and overly optimistic salesmen and a predictable paucity of parking? Check, check, check, and check. The Times article on the Bucks noted that the recent moves made by the team’s owners “were right out of the professional sports owner handbook.” Little did they know that there kind of is such a document. In 1998, Neil deMause and Joanna Cagan published the book Field of Schemes: How the Great Stadium Swindle Turns Public Money Into Private Profit, a compendium of the never-ending arms races between sports owners and municipal politicians, between pro leagues and their fans. DeMause and Cagan had plenty of material, from the Colts’ move from Baltimore to Indianapolis in 1984 to the impending demise of Tiger Stadium in 1999. But so much more has gone down since their book was published in the late ’90s — the relocation of the Montreal Expos to Washington, D.C., the spate of new stadiums in the New York metropolitan area, the battle over Fenway Park, and on and on — that in 2008 the authors released a revised and expanded edition that covered many of the ventures fueled by new “innovations” in municipal finance. But both versions of Field of Schemes feature an early chapter called “The Art of the Steal,” which outlines the six steps that most owners and developers seem to follow when they agitate for the athletic ideals of faster, higher, stronger to be poured in concrete form. How has CalgaryNEXT done, at this early stage, in sticking to this playbook? Let’s take a look. Derek Leung/Getty Images The exterior of Scotiabank Saddledome. “The first step is usually the obsolescence claim — alleging that your old stadium is obsolete, insufficient to cater to the demands of modern fans, or even on the verge of physical collapse.”
—Field of Schemes, page 64 The Saddledome was built in 1983 as part of Calgary’s successful bid to host the 1988 Winter Olympics; at the time, it “made its debut to oohs and aahs, an architectural wonder that became an instant icon on the city’s skyline.” How quickly things change. After a major 2013 summer flood filled the Saddledome with 10 feet of water, director of building operations Robert Blanchard said that his goal in cleaning up the building was one of maintaining the status quo rather than upgrading it. “If we did major upgrades … we’re still left with a concourse that doesn’t function properly,” he told reporters. “All sorts of other areas in the building are just 30 years old and obsolete and don’t work for us.” Last year, Flames president of hockey operations Brian Burke referred to the arena, with his characteristic bluntness, as “embarrassing … the finest state-of-the-art 1988 building in the league.” During last season, Gary Bettman paid a visit to Calgary and remarked that “I think everyone knows the issue with respect to the facility … this is a building that needs to be replaced.” In hindsight, it was only a matter of time before something like CalgaryNEXT was announced. “Successfully threatening to pick up and move a sports franchise to another city is an art form unto itself, one that you need to perform well if you’re to achieve your goal.”
—Field of Schemes, page 68 You have to give Ken King credit on this front: In a recent appearance on Bob McCown and Elliotte Friedman’s Fan 590 radio show, he was asked whether the team would be pulling the ol’ “we’re moving to Seattle!” maneuver anytime soon. “That’s not on the table,” he assured the skeptical hosts, even going so far as to call such a threat “a clumsy negotiating tactic.” It’s not unusual for the game to start out this way, though; Field of Schemes points out that it’s a delicate dance, that “those who are too direct about the threat risk getting slapped down by angry local politicians and columnists.” Still, things have a way of deteriorating. Take the Edmonton Oilers, who are years ahead of Calgary in the new-arena life cycle. (The path taken by Oilers ownership in its quest to get Rogers Place approved was described in a 2012 article as “four years of fuzzy numbers, shifting statements, apologies, bluster, brinkmanship, and revisionist history” — par for the course in these matters.) It was only a few years back that the Oilers brass and Wayne Gretzky just happened to be spotted in a luxury box at a Seattle Seahawks game. Now, the skeleton of their new building has risen in downtown Edmonton — sorry, in Ice District — and is expected to open next year. For Calgary, it’s still too early to be pushing these sorts of threats; nothing has descended that far into chaos and seeing-other-people subterfuge. Yet. “The mere threat of a team’s falling into second-class status has been enough to strike fear into the hearts of politicians and fans alike.”
—Field of Schemes, page 73 It’s cringe-worthy to contemplate how quickly a once-upscale building becomes an also-ran, but the Saddledome is the fourth-oldest building in the NHL. The three older are Madison Square Garden, which just underwent a billion dollars’ worth of refurbishing; Detroit’s Joe Louis Arena, which is not long for this world; and Edmonton’s Rexall Place. With Edmonton having already committed to its outsize new project, Calgary faces the implicit rivalry of keeping up with its biggest local rival, not to mention the NHL’s other teams. But these insecurities aren’t just on the ice. Often, this step of the process plays not only on a fan’s fears that his or her team might be left behind while others modernize and uplevel and lure free agents. It preys upon an entire city’s sense of self. One of the sharpest tools in the arena-escalation toolbox is the blanket appeal to civic pride with statements like this one, from local developer Michael Brown: “People can live anywhere. They don’t have to be here, which is why it’s important to have amenities that will attract and keep people in your city.” (Bonus points: This article includes the obligatory scare-tactic argument of “Calgary risks becoming a city like Buffalo.”) The people behind CalgaryNEXT have repeatedly stressed that this wouldn’t just be a new sports arena: It would be a community center, one that could revitalize an entire blighted neighborhood (more on that shortly) and include, among other things, a multiuse, semipublic field house that the city has sought to build for years. This field house is important: It’s the stated link to public funding for the entire project, a sort of sly “well, if you’re already going to the store, would you mind picking up a lifetime of groceries for me?” infiltration. “The numbers themselves here almost don’t matter. Predictions of economic benefit, in fact, are all over the map — which should come as no surprise, given that they all amount to little more than guesswork.”
—Field of Schemes, page 76 Even though Gary Bettman swore during the NHL lockout that he would not “negotiate in public,” he did let slip an interesting remark in a Q&A with the Winnipeg Free Press’s Gary Lawless. Asked whether the NHL’s “aggressive” first offer to the players had been a mistake, Bettman said: “I think the view some have of our first offer is fairly naive as it relates to collective bargaining. A sophisticated negotiator would have looked at it and said, ‘Obviously they want a 50-50 split.’ If we’re at 57 [percent of revenue to the league] and they propose 43, they must be telegraphing where they want to end.” I thought of this while reading something King had said to the Calgary Sun on Monday. Asked whether the financial stake from the ownership — a stated $200 million outright, just a small percentage of the total estimated funding of $890 million — is negotiable, King said: “If I said they were starting points, I’d be the dumbest negotiator.” It’s important to remember, as longtime Flames blogger Kent Wilson pointed out in his thoughtful summary of “How to Think Critically” about this deal, that everything outlined in the CalgaryNEXT proposal is merely an opening salvo, a moon shot, a way to anchor biases and frame negotiations. As Field of Schemes put it, “the numbers themselves here almost don’t matter.” What will ultimately unfold will likely look wildly different from anything we’re parsing now. (This goes for the actual buildings, too. The CalgaryNEXT team stresses that all the fancy renderings are just early-stage spaghetti thrown against the wall. It’s reminiscent of a quote in Field of Schemes from an architect about early Barclays Center plans in Brooklyn: “Don’t worry about the funny shapes at this point. These are just blocks. We’ll make something out of it as we go.”) Still, the existing numbers are as follows: The team says it will put up $200 million of private money. OK. Another $250 million would be reimbursed with a cut of future ticket sales, although it’s unclear exactly who would be up-fronting all of this dough. Two hundred million dollars would be straight public funding, and the CalgaryNEXT developers take great pains to stress that this amount is already earmarked by the city for that field house, which would be built regardless. But Mayor Naheed Nenshi has said that city funds have been allocated through 2018, and this project is not currently in the works. And then there is $240 million worth of a “community revitalization levy” — essentially a speculative source of funding in which debt is repaid by future taxes on local developments in the planned arena district that are, as yet, nothing but a gleam in entrepreneurs’ eyes. That sure is a lot of public funding for a project whose future revenues will, you can assume, almost entirely accumulate to the private side. “Proclaim that the window of opportunity on a new stadium will remain open only for so long, leaving unstated what disaster will befall the city if the window should be allowed to slam shut. [Frank] Rashid [cofounder of the Tiger Stadium Fan Club] calls it the ‘used car salesman’ approach: Buy now because this offer won’t be good for long.”
—Field of Schemes, page 77 The good news: We’re still too early in the process to be flooded with meaningless deadlines and eleventh-hour posturing. (Speaking of eleventh hours, one of my favorite parentheticals in Field of Schemes, about the 1988 battle over Comiskey Park, recalls that “Governor Jim Thompson had the clock turned off at 11:59 to avoid hitting a midnight deadline.”) The bad news: According to King, when it comes to CalgaryNEXT there is no Plan B. This is how it starts. “Cost overruns are a certainty, especially if you have plans for technological novelties like a state-of-the-art retractable roof.”
—Field of Schemes, page 78 A retractable roof may not be in the current plans for CalgaryNEXT, but the project does feature retractable seats. And that’s not all: According to the development’s FAQ, “We are exploring an option for a translucent roof for the Fieldhouse Stadium.” Cha-ching! But these sorts of potential fancy overruns don’t compare to the two biggest omissions in the CalgaryNEXT plans. One is any logistical consideration about the cost of roads and access to the new buildings. The other is the fact that the proposed site of development — an area called the West Village, which currently houses a Greyhound terminal and a bunch of car dealerships — is the site of major creosote contamination. A now-defunct plant that decades ago treated railway ties and telephone poles has left the land borderline unusable; any significant development in the area would first require a massive environmental cleanup. Estimates of the cost of that job have climbed as high as $300 million and isn’t included anywhere in the math about how much CalgaryNEXT would cost. The developers argue that cleanup would have to take place regardless, and that it therefore isn’t part of their project costs, per se. But no one is forcing them to develop on this particular parcel of barren land, and this is all pretty much the definition of keeping the goalposts out of reach. Speaking of moving the goalposts, there are those who believe that all of this is just the first step in what ultimately could become a bid for the 2026 Winter Olympics; that what we’re seeing is just the pump being primed. It makes sense: The original Saddledome, after all, was built that way. Never mind that, in 2011, sports economist Andrew Zimbalist remarked that “the signature venue in Calgary, the Saddledome, [was] viewed as obsolete and in need of replacing less than twenty years after the end of the Games.” Could CalgaryNEXT be … next? ??? Derek Leung/Getty Images View of the interior of Scotiabank Saddledome before a game between the Calgary Flames and the Columbus Blue Jackets. It’s one thing to convince locals that Calgary needs a new sports complex or two; besides the Saddledome, Calgary’s other major stadium, where the CFL’s Stampeders play, was built in 1960 and could use an update. But it’s another to cajole them into believing they should be the ones who foot the bill. That doesn’t mean the Calgary Sports and Entertainment folks won’t try, or that they aren’t canny in doing so. “Owners aren’t crazy for demanding local money to help build a stadium,” noted Andrew Sharp about the Milwaukee Bucks. “They’d be crazy not to do it.” The current CalgaryNEXT proposal ticks off nearly all the boxes that team owners, local developers, and major leagues have learned make for the best approach to maximizing profits while saddling — no pun intended! — others with the risks. “In this new Gilded Age,” wrote Charlie Pierce, “nothing should surprise us anymore.” Nothing should, but that doesn’t mean it isn’t still startling. Like any city, Calgary is a place where budgetary constraints are constantly reshaping priorities and causing tough decisions; over the last decade, a cancer center, for example, has been proposed and delayed and downsized and passed around. Summer floods and winter snow removal must constantly be managed. Alberta, as a province, is always subject to the ultra-boom-bust cycle of the oil industry. There are so many places in need of municipal funding. Should a new arena be among them, particularly when the taxpayers don’t directly share in the upside that they are asked to support? This is not a Calgary-specific question; it’s one that plays out, year after year, all around North America, and more often than not the team owners and their chosen developers follow the well-worn steps to get their way. A few years back, in a Sloan Sports Analytics conference on negotiation, the Flames’ Brian Burke (then with the Maple Leafs) explained that “my theory is, make the first meeting as short and unpleasant as possible. Sometimes it’s better to just punch the guy in the face.” But in the case of CalgaryNEXT, you get the sense that there is more unpleasantness yet to come. Once the balls get rolling, everything has a tendency to go downhill. This post has been updated to correct the year Field of Schemes was originally published.",2015-09-02T09:20:39+00:00,NHL,Baker
31,Cross-Examination: Jon Cooper Blinks in the NHL Spotlight,"Jon Cooper prefers to commence his press conferences with tiny zingers. He squints into the spotlight and feigns blindness. He invents issues with the microphone placed before him, as if he’s never encountered one before. He slides his water bottle a few inches to the left or right and then turns and asks an NHL rep if that’s in keeping with the league’s sponsorship and branding agreements. When media availabilities are held in small, cramped quarters, he comments on the stench inside the room. The other day, he looked around, declared things “musty,” and posited that everyone must have been out and about in Tampa the night before. Before Game 7 against Detroit, he noted that “it smells really bad in here,” adding “no offense.” None was taken: If there’s one thing sportswriters will lap up every time with hearty chuckles, it’s a good, solid neg. More 2015 NHL Playoffs All our coverage right here! Even following a frustrating outcome, such as the Lightning’s 2-1 Saturday loss to Chicago in a contest that left players injured and egos bruised, Cooper aims to disarm. He appeared weary, but still he quipped as he sat down that he’d at least be up there longer than he had been the last time. (It was a reference to earlier that morning, when his press conference had lasted 30 seconds, the only question being the inevitable and unanswerable one about whether an ailing Ben Bishop would start in net.) He was going for his usual lightness, but it landed a bit more heavily this time. The Lightning hadn’t just lost, they’d been defeated. Nikita Kucherov, the celebrated Triplets line’s scariest member, had been injured in a headfirst collision with a goalpost and never returned to the game. Bishop strayed from the net and collided with teammate Victor Hedman in no-man’s-land in what looked like a scene from an early Mighty Ducks blooper montage.  Late in the game, with the Blackhawks up 2-1, Lightning fans raged and neutral observers puzzled over a number of tactical decisions. Why was the plodding Brenden Morrow, bless his old grizzled heart, on the ice with the Lightning down a goal with five minutes to play? Why was Steven Stamkos parked on the bench for upward of two minutes at a time? Why was no timeout taken? WTF regarding that too-many-men call against Tampa Bay with 8.8 seconds left? In the locker room after the Chicago win, Stamkos betrayed a rare glimmer of vexation with what had happened. “I mean, I’m not the coach,” he said. “You’ll have to ask him that.” He added diplomatically that the team had won with its depth all season and that everyone always gave their all, but the point remained. Expectations were high for Cooper’s presser — even the typically docile Sports Illustrated NHL Twitter account said Cooper “deserved to be roasted” — but it passed mostly uneventfully. Still: It was the first time that anyone can remember that Cooper’s seat felt truly hot. ??? Mike Carlson/Getty Images By now, the story of Jon Cooper has been well told: his former career as a defense attorney and his subsequent step-by-step ascension through the hockey ranks. It’s a journey that included character-molding moments like hammering nails into boards in hockey hotbeds like Texarkana. He has won championships at nearly every level and is oh-so-close to winning one in the NHL, a league that he reminds his players — and, you have to imagine, occasionally himself — is “big boy hockey.” It was fitting that at a press conference early in the series, his mom and dad stood against the wall, beaming proudly at their son.1 One of Cooper’s players told NHL.com that two of the coach’s rules for the team come from Wedding Crashers. Rule 76: No excuses, play like a champion. Rule 113: Don’t look for opportunities, make them. Such thoughtful irreverence is classic Cooper. But when a reporter asked him about a recent dinner out in Chicago, for which Blackhawks fan Vince Vaughn, dining nearby, picked up the tab, Cooper sensed it was better not to make it a big deal. “Just random,” he said of the night, seeming almost embarrassed by the question. “We’ve gone out as a staff together in every single series. Maybe there’s just a little more notoriety because we’re in the finals. Those are all just staff dinners.” Watching Cooper navigate the novelty of the Stanley Cup final alongside his players has been fascinating. As he pointed out, Tampa Bay began the playoffs as the team with relative inexperience, a lovable bunch of young up-and-comers learning on the go. The same can be said for their coach. (Before games at Amalie Arena, the Jumbotron displays adoring footage of Cooper as if he’s just another one of the boys.) But there have been little stumbles here and there — mostly born of his lawyerly ability to pick his words precisely and still butt heads with the hockey world’s predilection for revealing little to the press. Bishop’s shady injury has brought this tension to the forefront: Cooper tried to deflect requests for information that he has no intention of providing with his trademark humor. (Invoking the ghost of the famously reticent former Lightning head coach John Tortorella, as Cooper has done on more than one occasion, is always good for a press-distracting laugh.) But he occasionally runs the risk of being perceived as disingenuous, of his jokes seeming less folksy and more shtick. The hockey world is comfortable with coaches who speak in sentence fragments and dole out nuggets of information with the generosity of Soviet bread-line functionaries.2 It’s just not quite used to assessing the agendas of smoother talkers. As the stakes have been raised with each postseason contest, there’s been a learning curve for everyone both on and off the ice. As Cooper said after Game 5, “I guess we’ve gone from an inexperienced playoff team to an experienced playoff team.” There’s truth in that. The happy-go-lucky Lightning struggled early in the first round, then went into Detroit down 3-2 and roundly beat the Red Wings on the road. After winning a tense Game 7, they mostly made a mockery of Montreal in the second round. In the conference finals, the Lightning absorbed a couple of blowout losses to the Rangers and rebounded to shut them out in Games 5 and 7 in Madison Square Garden. They crowed that Henrik Lundqvist wasn’t all that, that they weren’t scared of his “aura.” They were cocky, and they were also right.  But this isn’t the first round, or the conference finals, or even Game 1 of the championship. This is Game 6, the first evening The Cup Is In The Building, as you’ll be reminded ad infinitum. And it ain’t there to welcome Tampa Bay to the Windy City or pick up anyone’s dinner tabs. For all of the Lightning’s in-season experience, they’re now facing a Blackhawks team that has won two Cups since 2010 and will be buoyed by rabid fans eager to see the first championship won at home since the 1930s; this time, Tampa Bay can’t necessarily charm its way out of a jam. In a media availability yesterday, both Cooper and his players seemed more relaxed than they had been in the aftermath of Game 5; Stamkos even said that he found the talk about his ice time “overblown.” Cooper answered questions about timeout strategy and lack of star player production with none of the prickliness that had been on display Saturday night. It’s quite possible that Tampa Bay could take Game 6 and put the pressure on Chicago. But for now, it’s squarely on the Lightning’s backs — and particularly on the back of its coach. And that’s why this is interesting. Before his first season with the Lightning, Cooper said a GM had advised him that “the NHL can be toxic and negative,” and that Cooper didn’t have that in him, and that he should make sure it stayed that way. “Don’t lose that,” the GM warned. Cooper hasn’t lost it. But it does seem like he has hardened just a teensy bit, not unlike a player who has been there, done that, and come out on the other side just a tad more battle weary, just a smidgen less naive. For those who love Cooper’s boyish forthrightness, this can be a sad thing, though it’s certainly not a bad thing. This is big-boy hockey, as Coop would say. Sometimes, after all, a chip on someone’s shoulder just makes for better, stronger padding.",2015-06-15T14:13:05+00:00,NHL,Baker
32,Stanley Cup Game 4 Wrap: When Your Best Isn’t What’s Best for You,"Really, the weakest part of Brandon Saad’s Game 4–winning power move on Wednesday night was the shot itself. With the game tied, as usual, in the third period in front of a nerve-racked and monochrome United Center crowd, Saad skated toward the boards after a faceoff, snagged control of the puck, and strong-armed past a pair of defenders at the crease like LeBron James driving the lane. Then, for a second, the play died. Tampa Bay Lightning goaltender Andrei Vasilevskiy, a 20-year-old from the oil capital of Siberia who was tapped on game day to replace an ailing Ben Bishop, reached out and disrupted Saad’s progress, poking the puck free. But Saad got a skate on it, kind of, then his stick on it, sort of. He whacked a semi-whiff of a backhand in the direction of the net, and the puck rolled through the emptiness between Vasilevskiy’s pads. The United Center erupted, all of those red jerseys going from latent magma to hot lava. “What is he, 21 years old?” asked Blackhawks forward Patrick Sharp after the game. (Saad is 22, thankyouverymuch.) “He looks like a grown man out there. Takes the puck, tells everybody what he’s going to do with it, just bulls people over and gets to that net.”  Hockey’s funny — had Saad, who said he just “tried to drive and create some chaos,” gotten the perfect full-speed shot off, had he lifted the puck off the ice, Vasilevskiy may well have been positioned to make the save. Sometimes your best isn’t good enough, but other times your best isn’t what’s best for you. Just ask Steven Stamkos. More 2015 NHL Playoffs All our coverage right here! In a flurry of action in the game’s final minutes that undoubtedly felt like a lifetime to Chicago supporters, the trailing Lightning got off shot after shot, including two Grade-A chances square off the stick of Tampa Bay’s biggest star. One of them seemed so surefire that it caused defenseman Victor Hedman, who had as good of a vantage point as anyone in the arena, to raise his arms in celebration. (Save by Corey Crawford.) Another was heading toward a gaping expanse of open net until it suddenly wasn’t. (Block by Brent Seabrook.) “I don’t know how one of those didn’t go in,” Tampa Bay coach Jon Cooper said afterward. “I’m sure there were 22,000 nervous people in the stands when we were zipping it around there.”  ??? If the fans in Chicago were nervous — and they sure were — it was a function of a few things. For one, the Blackhawks have developed a worrisome tendency to lose their grasp on leads throughout this playoff run. Ten times in the postseason the Blackhawks got a goal and then, within two minutes, gave one up — the latest being Ondrej Palat’s Game 3 goal that came so soon after a Chicago score that the public address system was still announcing details. (An Uber driver in a Hawks jersey who attended Game 3 said he’d been in the middle of chugging a customary celebratory beer when Palat’s goal went in.) And then there was the series of excruciating almosts in Game 4 that suggested this might not be the Blackhawks’ night: goalposts loudly denied Marcus Kruger and Sharp in the first period with the score tied 0-0; a crossbar did the same to Kimmo Timonen at 1-1 in the third. If Saad was aiming to create chaos, Jonathan Toews sought to control it. A scramble in front of the net in the first period led to a rebound that found the captain’s stick, and he swept the puck in for a 1-0 lead. It was a relief in more ways than one: An emerging story line in this series, and one that players and coaches are growing visibly tired of discussing, has been the dearth of scoring from the Toews-Kane-Stamkos trio. Toews’s goal didn’t put an end to the discussion, but it was a start.  Midway through the first period, Alex Killorn converted a beautiful behind-the-net pass from Valtteri Filppula, sending the puck back from whence it came and catching Crawford sliding in the wrong direction. The play looked a bit like a rally winner in tennis: By the time Crawford reacted, the point was already past. It was a rare misstep in a hell of a game by the Hawks goalie, who did an otherwise fine job of anticipating Tampa Bay’s trademark east-west maneuvers. In contrast to the Chicago takeover of Amalie Arena in Tampa — and Game 5, on Saturday night, ought to play host to another huge number of visitors, ticket policies be damned — there was scarcely a blue sweater in the United Center crowd for Games 3 and 4. Lightning goals resulted in a vacuum of sound, a collective gulp, a great swallowing void. Had Tampa Bay converted on any of those shots in the final minute, it would have sounded as if millions of voices had cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced. But there was to be no great disturbance in the Force. In the basement of the arena after the game, United Center staffers pushing carts of concessions inventory were in happy spirits, talking about Chicago’s two recent Cups — how both had been won on the road, and how maybe this year they’d see the trophy at home. Hockey’s funny: Winner Brad Richards evaluated the night as “probably our worst game in a while, for whatever reason.” Loser Anton Stralman said “we’re playing some good hockey — sometimes you play well and you don’t get the results you want, but that’s OK. That’s hockey.” After four games, the two teams are eerily matched: 107-104 in shots, 9-9 in goals, and 2-2 in wins. ??? On Tuesday, NBC Sports chairman Mark Lazarus remarked that he wished NHL players would lose those defacing playoff beards, and that he had even tried to get the league to ban them. “Let’s get their faces out there,” he said. “Let’s talk about how young and attractive they are … These are the most-watched games and they’re all bearded up.” Players chuckled at this. “I don’t think that’s gonna fly with us,” Tampa Bay’s Andrej Sustr said. Far from rendering them unrecognizable, the facial hair on Wednesday night’s victors gave them a look all their own. Saad and Toews sat on the dais in the press-conference room answering questions, a Game of Thrones swordsman with center-parted hair and sleek, manicured beard alongside an Amish farmer with intense, beady eyes and patchy chinstrap. They smirked at each other’s answers, as the Blackhawks so often do; so many inside jokes were left unsaid. Saad said he’d looked up to the Pittsburgh Penguins while growing up in Pennsylvania, that Mario and Jagr were his first role models, and that he’d loved watching Crosby and Malkin as a promising teen. Toews smiled at this, and you wondered what he was thinking, but in a way you could guess. Those Penguins won a Cup in 2009 and were the toast of the league, the sport’s future, a surefire dynasty just getting its start. Then the Blackhawks won a year later, and then again three years after that, and they are now oh-so-close to a third Cup in six years. They’ve done so despite losing key players and bringing new guys into the fold, despite off-ice distractions and on-ice disarray. (Coach Joel Quenneville’s notorious linemate switcharoos still endure; the Blackhawks debuted some surprise new looks for Game 4 at the same time the Lightning orchestrated some goalie gamesmanship of their own.) Still, hockey’s funny: For all of Chicago’s success, the Lightning have been right there with them. Either team could conceivably have won all four games. Toews said the last few minutes last night seemed to go on forever. “I guess when you’re protecting a lead, especially against a team like this,” he said, “they’re always a lot longer than you’d think.” Neither team has the lead at the moment, and neither team should. It’s been a rollicking, tense, fast Cup final, one filled with youngsters and breakouts and marketable stars, beards notwithstanding. We’re guaranteed a game apiece in Tampa and Chicago — and it’s safe to venture a guess it will last beyond that, even longer than anyone thinks.",2015-06-11T14:21:24+00:00,2015 NHL Playoffs,Baker
33,Unlucky Seven: Watching the Rangers and the Ducks Squander Their Stanley Cup Chances,"Marc Staal wore his New York Rangers hat pulled down so low it was hard to see his eyes. Henrik Lundqvist’s peepers were almost feral in their stunned desperation. A “pissed off” Rick Nash lamented that this had been “our best chance to get a championship, and we lost.” But his quiet words were mostly drowned out by Martin St. Louis pulling tape off his equipment at an adjacent Madison Square Garden locker — the slow rip of an endless Band-Aid, the sound of a season unraveling. One night later and about 3,000 miles away, a similar scene played out in Anaheim. Patrick Maroon sat in one corner of the Ducks locker room with an empty expression and a bushy playoff beard. The door to a players’ lounge swung open every now and then, revealing Ryan Kesler staring at nothing, fingers interlocked behind wet hair. Cam Fowler, camera lights trained on his face, blinked back tiny ocean swells of regret. In a pair of conference final seventh games that determined which teams would sally forth to this week’s Stanley Cup final and which would slog through the swamps of hindsight and second-guessing, both home teams lost, and lost badly. The Rangers fell 2-0 to the Lightning in front of a grim, moneyed crowd, while the Ducks lost 5-3 in a building overwhelmed by swaggering Blackhawks fans. More 2015 NHL Playoffs All our coverage right here! It wasn’t supposed to be this way. With the NBA playoffs on a weeklong hiatus and the NHL boasting Game 7s in both conference finals for just the second time in league history — on Friday and Saturday nights, no less — excitement was cresting in both cities. In New York, a Rangerstown flag rippled behind a fire truck zooming down Ninth Avenue. A man stood in line for face paint at a pregame fan fest, then presented the back of his bald head as the blank canvas for a Rangers shield once he got to the front. Anaheim wasn’t much different. On Saturday morning, small orange flags flew from Prius windows on the freeway. Two hours before puck drop, a woman in a Ducks jersey at Rubio’s, a taco joint near Honda Center, asked an employee if she could get a different order number placard for her table. “Oh, wait, never mind,” she said, examining it more closely. “It says 38, not 88. I thought you’d given us Patrick Kane’s number! There’s only so much we can take!” Ultimately, though, both host teams performed like children who are so damn charming until they’re saddled with an overeager audience — Come on! Sing that cute song you always do! — and can do nothing but freeze and wilt. The Rangers scored 17 goals in two wins and an overtime loss down in Tampa, but in Games 5 and 7 at Madison Square Garden managed exactly none. Three of the Ducks’ four previous playoff losses didn’t come until overtime, but on Saturday night it took just one period for the game to feel like it was over. “I hate to say it, but I’m getting older and the window might be closing,” lamented Rangers defenseman Dan Girardi on Friday night, giving WFAN callers fodder for a summer’s worth of angst. “I’m not telling you that [the Blackhawks] are a better team than us,” said Ducks captain Ryan Getzlaf, who has been knocked out of the playoffs in a Game 7 at home for three straight years. “I’m telling you that they played better than us tonight. They played good enough to win.” ???  James Devaney/GC Images With two off days leading into Friday’s contest, Tampa Bay had lots of time to be asked about the Rangers’ intimidating record — specifically, Lundqvist’s — in Game 7s at MSG. New York had won six straight, and its goalie’s save percentage and goals-against average were downright gaudy in that span. But throughout the Eastern Conference finals, the Lightning consistently refused to be awestruck. Early on, they spoke of the need to harsh the mellow of Lundqvist’s trippy aura, and then they did, scoring 12 combined goals in Games 2 and 3. By the time they reached Friday morning, that attitude had only hardened. “I respect what the Rangers have done in their elimination games, or whatever you call them,” coach Jon Cooper said. “Well, against us — we’re 0-0.” Steven Stamkos, who became captain of the Lightning last year when the team traded lifer Martin St. Louis to New York, praised Lundqvist to a point. “But he’s never played the Tampa Bay Lightning in a Game 7 before,” he said. And while the Lightning may have lacked the longer-term experience of the Rangers, they had amassed some very recent — and very relevant — résumé-worthy playoff accomplishments themselves. Facing elimination by the Red Wings in the first round, the Lightning entered hostile territory and tied the series with a 5-2 win in Game 6, then outlasted the Wings in a tense Game 7 to advance. And their two wins at MSG were good for more than just internal confidence and coaching pep talks — they had proved the Lightning’s might to increasingly nervous New York fans. You could feel that anxiety in the stands. “This is just like Game 5,” a man with a raspy New York accent wailed between the second and third periods Friday night. Another New York supporter steadied himself miserably against a wall under a “Draft Beer” sign, his head in his hands. “Your hair’s a little grayer than before,” his buddy said. “Oh, it’s so much grayer,” he replied, forlornly going to order two more beers before last call. The score at this point was 0-0. So when Alex Killorn scored about two minutes into the third period on a backhand that slipped softly through traffic and Lundqvist’s legs, the arena was as quiet as a white-noise machine. It really did feel like Game 5: no margin for error, no support for Lundqvist, and definitely zero joy in Mudville.  In a perverse way, Ondrej Palat’s goal nine minutes later was almost a relief — it would have felt wrong for this series to hinge so heavily on that first score. A dynamic Tyler Johnson pass to a streaking Palat, on the other hand? That was the kind of laser beam sequence that had defined this Eastern Conference final all along. The guys on the Lightning bench jumped up and down like schoolkids after the second goal, but they quickly stopped and acted stoic. As the clock and the season ticked away, Lundqvist slumped over on the Rangers bench. But it was Cooper’s face during the final 10 seconds that betrayed so much. Earlier that morning, the second-year NHL coach had dismissed Alain Vigneault’s notion that this was just one more game in a long season of them. “I don’t think it’s just another game,” he said. “This is Game 7. I’m not going to sit here and hide this from our guys, saying, ‘Oh, fellas, this is one of 103 or 104 or whatever we’re playing.’” Now, he made it exactly clear how important this game was. As the seconds slipped off the clock, he broke into a wide and giddy grin. ???  It was never all that quiet at Honda Center, not even after the Chicago Blackhawks took an early 2-0 lead. “Our house, our team,” read a big arched sign above the arena’s main entrance — but even before the puck dropped, you suspected that wasn’t the case. The parking lot was teeming with Blackhawks fans who traveled to the game in their distinctive red jerseys, with a few requisite white “Griswold” sweaters here and there. Both the Ducks and the Blackhawks were sent home last season with Game 7 losses to the eventual Cup-winning Los Angeles Kings. “It’s a long process,” said Chicago coach Joel Quenneville of the road to recovering from that kind of blow. “There were a lot of bumps and curves and challenges.” The Western Conference final had been full of all three for the Blackhawks, from triple-overtime games to a battered defensive corps to an Anaheim team so physically punishing that Kesler bragged, after Game 4, that “no human can withstand that many hits.” But Chicago did withstand it, and won Game 6 at home, 5-2, to force the seventh game. Anaheim coach Bruce Boudreau said that with the stakes at their highest, it would be the highest-level players who would step up. “Everybody that’s a really top-notch player wants it on their shoulders,” he said Saturday morning. “They want to be the difference-makers on both teams.” On Saturday night, that player turned out to be Jonathan Toews. It’s scary to remember that the Chicago captain is only 27; he has the gravitas and the trophy case of a player a decade his senior. Just two and a half minutes into the first period, he buried a rebound to give the Hawks an early lead. On a power play less than 10 minutes later, he netted a long snap shot to go up 2-0.  With the way this series had gone, a 2-0 lead didn’t feel entirely safe; after all, the Ducks had scored three goals in 37 seconds in Game 4. But bounces that had gone Anaheim’s way suddenly evaporated; chances by Maroon and Corey Perry late in the first were shut down by Corey Crawford. Shortly into the second period, Brandon Saad found himself inexplicably all alone at one side of the crease, and he buried a pass from Kane for the 3-0 lead. The dagger came when a puck deflected off Marian Hossa’s skate and into the net, with officials determining after a review that there wasn’t a distinct enough kicking motion to call back the 4-0 goal. Kesler scored with under two minutes left in the second period to give Anaheim a bit of hope, and despite the 4-1 deficit, Ducks fans didn’t seem nearly as despondent as expected on a lap around the concourse during intermission. But Chicago fans were ruling the roost: Let’s go Hawks chants were everywhere; one man unfurled a huge Blackhawks banner and posed for a photo with about a dozen supporters of the visiting team; and a drunken idiot sidled up to a cop and slurred “Blackhawks lives matter,” then repeated the mal mot for effect in case he had not been heard. (The officer, to his great credit, just rolled his eyes.) Perry’s goal midway through the third made it 4-2 and introduced the possibility of an all-time comeback, but a sequence shortly after sealed the game. Fowler passed up a good shot at the point, Hossa took away the puck, Fowler panic-tripped him, and Brent Seabrook scored on the resulting power play. “I made a couple plays I wish I could’ve had back,” Fowler said afterward. “It’s miserable, an awful feeling.” ???  In the hallway outside the visitor’s locker room at Madison Square Garden, two men embraced. One had on a well-tailored suit and a newly minted conference champions hat; the other was Charles Barkley. “We’re gonna have a hell of a party,” the Lightning executive said to the NBA legend, who replied “Yeah we are!” and went off to find and congratulate his buddy Cooper, whom he’d met during a road trip in L.A. last season. Inside the locker room, in front of a whiteboard in the shape of an ice rink upon which someone had scrawled “Just win baby,” a smiley Stamkos said that “for whatever reason, that was probably the most calm Game 7 I’ve ever played in.” Standing nearby, the 5-foot-9 Johnson wore a conference champions T-shirt that still had a hologram sticker near the collar and hung down to mid-thigh. Palat finished giving interviews and then slung his overstuffed hockey bag onto his shoulder and sauntered out into the hall. The Lightning had gone big, and now it was time to go home. The talk surrounding the Rangers (and, to an extent, the Ducks) had been about championship windows closing. But for the Lightning, whose roster had the youngest average age of the remaining playoff teams, it’s all cross breezes and fresh air. “You shine the light bright on our guys,” Cooper said, “and they’ll just put on sunglasses and walk right through it.” The Blackhawks, meanwhile, have treated the playoffs like they’re some high school Romeo with a ladder. This is the third Stanley Cup final appearance they’ve ascended to since 2010. Their locker room had an excited if workmanlike air: This was how things should be, how things should have been last year. Kane shrugged off questions about his early return from a broken clavicle, not allowing anyone to make it into too big of a deal. Brad Richards, now 8-0 in Game 7s, acknowledged it would be cool to play his former squad — a team he won a Cup and a Conn Smythe with in 2004 — in the final. “It’s going to be special,” he said. “But I want to win one. We’ll worry about friendships later.” For Tampa Bay and Chicago, this will be a final featuring fast skating, shifty passing, and a marked departure from the bigger-grittier-stronger mentality made trendy by teams like the Kings and Bruins over the past few years. For New York and Anaheim, it will be painful to even think about, rock salt in a gaping wound, the sting of having to head back down to base camp when the summit is just in sight. Cleaning crews had yet to perform their nightly wizardry outside Madison Square Garden in the wee hours of Saturday morning, and blue and red litter remained scattered everywhere, dozens of would-be celebrations all curdled into trash. But outside Honda Center on that breezy West Coast Saturday evening, the ugly traces of civilization were mostly cleared up as soon as the game let out. The spotlessness somehow felt more bleak: It was as if nothing had ever happened inside that building, on that night or all the others. How quickly it could all be swept away. This piece originally misstated the nature of Patrick Kane’s injury this season. He suffered a broken clavicle, not a separated shoulder.",2015-06-01T14:19:40+00:00,NHL,Baker
34,Win and Go Home: The New York Rangers Push the Lightning to Game 7,"Tampa Bay Lightning coach Jon Cooper has argued professionally in front of courtroom judges, scrambled his way up the hockey ranks at breakneck speed, and guided his team to the brink of a Stanley Cup berth in his second full season behind the bench. But he still hasn’t developed all that great of a poker face. Following a pair of lopsided losses at home to the New York Rangers, one a 5-1 result on Friday night in Game 4 and the other a 7-3 contest last night in Game 6, Cooper seemed visibly frustrated. Asked on Friday how he saw the second period unfold, Cooper answered the question with a question. “I don’t know,” he said with a grimace, “how did you see it play out?” More 2015 NHL Playoffs All our coverage right here! Last night, he went into peeved parrot mode once more. Queried about how he thought his team might respond after a dispiriting Game 6 — another bizarre one in which the Lightning led 16-7 in shots after the first period but trailed 2-1 in goals — he looked as though he might break into maniacal Arya Stark–style laughter. “How do I think we’re going to respond?” he repeated, before finally settling himself down. “We’re going to respond the same way we have every time our backs are against the wall.” In both cases, the outcomes themselves weren’t the only thing that nagged at Cooper. His mood seemed to stem more from various oddities in-game. One of the Rangers goals in Game 4 was “going ten feet wide,” he estimated, before caroming off defenseman Victor Hedman’s leg and into the net. “How often does that happen?” Cooper said. (He has a point: You know something is awry when Tanner Glass is on the ice for a goal.) As for Game 6, the first 40 minutes looked a whole lot like a continuation of Sunday’s Game 5, in which the Lightning won 2-0 at a glum Madison Square Garden and appeared to be well on their way to a spot in the finals. “For five straight periods, we played really, really well,” Cooper said. “We thought we were playing a 2-1 game. Unfortunately, we weren’t winning 2-1.” The Rangers were lucky to have the lead after two periods last night, buoyed in large part by the determined play of Henrik Lundqvist, who had 28 saves going into the third. He stoned Steven Stamkos point-blank to prevent the sniper from tying the game 1-1 late in the first and denied Tyler Johnson early in the second. The only goal he gave up in the game’s early going was to his former teammate Ryan Callahan on a power play breakaway that left Lundqvist looking unusually set in stone.  By the midway point of the third, though, the Rangers had amassed three more goals (one assisted by Glass!), driven Ben Bishop from the net, and built a semi-comfortable lead that all but assured there would be yet another Game 7 etched in the bizarre annals of Rangers postseason history. (I say semi-comfortable because, with lots of time left on the clock and Tampa pressing, it was hard not to think of Game 6 against Washington, in which the Rangers nearly squandered a 4-1 third-period lead.) New York would add another pair of goals by the end of the game — as would Tampa’s Nikita Kucherov, a member of that scary Triplets line that has so often made the Rangers look like a harried, outnumbered mother of multiples. But last night, the finest trio on the ice belonged to New York. Derick Brassard, revved by a coach’s challenge, finished with a hat trick and two helpers, while his linemates Rick Nash and J.T. Miller each put up a goal and three assists. For all the hand-wringing about Nash’s production in the playoffs — and a portion of it, for some time, was entirely fair — the guy jokingly referred to in the Rangers locker room as the “Slim Reaper” now has 14 points in 18 playoff games. His best play last night wasn’t his chippy rebound goal, it was an earlier sequence in which he stole the puck from the 6-foot-8 Andrej Sustr near Tampa’s blue line, used his big body to shield it, and made a pretty little back-pass to Miller. A cross-slot slap pass from Miller to Brassard led to the exact sort of goal with which Tampa has been tormenting New York all series long.  And so we move on to another Game 7 at Madison Square Garden, and another few days of hearing the stats about how the Rangers are 7-0 in these games. (These stats are mind-blowing on the surface, but at their root overblown, considering that every postseason a team has the theoretical potential to win four Game 7s but only lose one.) This has been a schizophrenic series, and it’s hard to guess what kind of matchup we’ll get: another wide-open goal fest? Another hard-checking contest in which two goals is enough? But it can’t be sustainable for the Rangers to once again be outshot and outplayed by the Lightning while seemingly scoring at will — the exact situation that has left the ordinarily happy-go-lucky Cooper at a rare loss for words twice. On the other hand, it doesn’t really have to be. There’s no smaller sample size than a Game 7, after all. You only have to win once.",2015-05-27T11:47:49+00:00,NHL,Baker
35,Lightning Strikes Thrice: How Tyler Johnson’s Killer Trifecta Sank the Rangers,"He recorded the first playoff hat trick in Tampa Bay Lightning history, taming beastly goaltender Henrik Lundqvist short-handed, on the power play, and at even strength. He tightened his grip on the playoff scoring race with his 11th goal, four more than star snipers Corey Perry and Patrick Kane. And yet Tyler Johnson’s most ridiculous play of the night, the one that left Rangers fans raising their eyebrows like ruh-roh, came when the 5-foot-9 whirling dervish didn’t even have a stick in his hands. Late in the second period, Marc Staal was heading toward the puck and out of his defensive zone when Johnson, sans bâton, barreled into the 6-foot-4 defenseman, leaving him spinning. Johnson then “soccered it,” as Mike Emrick exclaimed, to Steven Stamkos for a quality scoring chance. (It was one of the few for the Lightning last night that didn’t wind up in the back of the net.)   In a wild and often crazed Game 2 of the Eastern Conference finals, the Lightning unglued and embarrassed the New York Rangers, 6-2, to tie the series at one game apiece. And it was Johnson who contributed a full half of those goals — one while his team was doubly short-handed, 5-on-3; one on a ballsy precision shot that straight-up bested the world’s best goaltender; and one that found order in a disheveled scrum of sticks and limbs in the Rangers’ crease. More 2015 NHL Playoffs All our coverage right here! After Game 1, which the Rangers won by their customary 2-1 score, Tampa Bay coach Jon Cooper said watching the game tape had made him “want to vomit.” He stressed it would be key for the Lightning to make Lundqvist look human: “The one thing you have to combat is the aura,” he said. On Monday night, it was the Madison Square Garden crowd left feeling nauseated as their goaltender was lit up for six goals on 26 shots, even if a number of them weren’t quite his fault. (As one observer put it, despite the chaos, the game only caused Lundqvist’s sterling save percentage at even strength to “plummet from .948 to .944.”) “You walk into that kid’s house,” Cooper said last night about Johnson, “and you look at his trophy mantle — all you see is trophies. Winning follows that kid.” Like player, like coach. Johnson played for Cooper when both were American Hockey League strivers; they won a Calder Cup in 2012 and found full-time employment in the big leagues at roughly the same time. Just as Cooper’s own ascent to the Eastern Conference finals came after successful stops at every rung of the ladder, from a Michigan high school parochial league to junior hockey to the minors, Johnson’s climb was both methodical and mystical, based on hard work, yes, but also benefiting from a healthy helping of luck. He could have wound up on a number of NHL teams, but he went with the Lightning, an organization that in hindsight was well-positioned to take advantage of young and semi-proven prospects like himself.  Johnson won a Memorial Cup in 2008 and a gold medal at the World Junior Championship in 2010, skating alongside and against players like P.K. Subban, Taylor Hall, Derek Stepan, and Chris Kreider. He endeared himself to the fans of his hometown junior hockey team near the Washington-Idaho border, the Spokane Chiefs of the rough-and-tumble Western Hockey League. But as a 20-year-old contemplating the future of his hockey career late in 2010, one thing stuck in his mind: He didn’t want to wind up as That Guy on some college campus. “When I was 20 years old, right before I went back to juniors in Spokane, I almost didn’t know if I even wanted to go back,” Johnson told Tampa Bay Lightning reporter Bryan Burns in January, shortly before he took part in his first NHL All-Star Game. “I didn’t want to be a 20-year-old freshman in college somewhere. I thought maybe I should just start my life and start my career somewhere.” Johnson had always hoped his career would involve hockey, but after being cut from his USHL team and later passed over in the NHL draft for three years running, mostly because of fears about his small and unchangeable frame, he couldn’t help but start mentally venturing down other roads. Med school, perhaps. Doctors don’t have to be tall. Instead, he trudged back to junior for one more year, earned a slew of awards, and caught the eye of some NHL scouts who were sifting through refuse, panning for gold. One of them was Al Murray, a Hockey Canada scout who came to the Lightning in the fall of 2010 and was part of the franchise’s decision to take a flier on Johnson the following spring. Four years later, Johnson is part of a team built largely from within, with a few key free-agent signings — notably steady defenseman Anton Stralman, who was picked up from the Rangers — bolstering a homegrown roster. Last season, both Johnson and his linemate Ondrej Palat were finalists for the Calder Trophy, given to the league’s top rookie. (Nathan MacKinnon, the NHL’s first overall pick before that season began, ultimately won the award.) In the AHL, Johnson and Palat had been part of a unit called the “Top Gun Line.” This year, the two of them and Nikita Kucherov have been such a solid trio that Cooper mused in November, “It’s weird, because they all seem to be on the same wavelength. It’s like they’re triplets. It seems those three guys are almost thinking for each other, and it’s pretty sweet to watch.” The name stuck: They’ve been known as the Triplets ever since.  Just as Johnson’s been both lucky and good over the last several seasons, the Lightning were both in Game 2. While the Rangers botched a number of odd-man rushes, the Lightning capitalized on theirs. While Ben Bishop was frequently sprawled far outside his net, he managed to keep most pucks far outside too. It’s unlikely there will be another game this series — hell, even this postseason — with as many penalties and bank shots and net-crashing goals as this one had; it’s safe to say Lundqvist won’t let six go by again anytime soon. (The last time he did so was in his first playoff game nearly a decade ago.) But on a team that features Stamkos, one of the few bona fide superstars in a mostly egalitarian league, it is instead Johnson who has earned front-runner status for the Conn Smythe Trophy, given to the most valuable player in the postseason. Of course, this presupposes that Tampa Bay wins the Cup, or gets tantalizingly close; they’re not there yet. But Johnson has built his career off of getting there. Med school is just going to have to wait.",2015-05-19T15:15:25+00:00,NHL,Baker
36,The Ultimate Beast: Witnessing the Rangers’ Pants-Wettingly Intense Game 7 Overtime Victory,"J.T. Miller rolled up his gym shorts, twisted around, and tried to check out a rising red welt on the back of his thigh. He showed it off to his buddy Chris Kreider. “I’ve got one too,” Kreider said. Across the locker room, Kevin Hayes, dried blood still on his lip, described his game-tying score. “A goal’s a goal,” he said several times, either at a loss for words or simply too tired, after the Rangers’ 2-1 Game 7 overtime win over the Washington Capitals, to be creative with them. A crowded scrum around Henrik Lundqvist finally dissipated, with a handful of smiling Swedish media lingering. When they wandered away, a lucky kid who’d been hanging around the locker room came and stood next to Lundqvist, his body about the same size as one of the Rangers goalie’s leg pads. Shy and awestruck, he made what had to have been one of the tougher inquiries of the night. “Were you ready when they scored?” His little voice made the question an actual chirp. “Was I ready?” Lundqvist repeated, laughing, not quite knowing whether to be charmed or affronted. “Well, it was a really good shot.” More 2015 NHL Playoffs All our coverage right here! It seems impossible that anyone could ever really be ready for the razor’s-edge uncertainty and fist-gnawing tension of an overtime Game 7, one of the wildest scenarios in the wide world of sports. Yet when it came to this Rangers-Capitals series, it felt as though everyone had secretly been preparing for this to go down for the better part of two weeks. This was the fifth time the two teams had met in the playoffs in the past seven seasons, and the fourth time the series extended to seven games. And this year, all seven — from the Capitals’ last-microsecond winner in Game 1, to the Rangers’ from-the-dead comeback in Game 5, to Sunday night’s gangbusters 4-3 game — were decided by just one goal. Never mind that the Capitals had at one point led the series three games to one before losing three straight. Overtime in Game 7 was the only plausible way this could end. “Going into this series I [was] listening to all you experts,” Capitals coach Barry Trotz told the media with a smile after Washington’s practice on Tuesday. “And everyone was saying it’s going to be a long, seven-game series. So you got what you wanted.”  ??? With two off days between Games 6 and 7, there was plenty of time for the spotlight to land on each team’s finest player, tracking their every comment, describing their every stretch. For the Rangers, the focus was on Lundqvist, the once-in-a-generation goaltender who returned in late March from a two-month absence after being nailed in the throat with a puck and hardly looked any worse for the wear. While he gave up three goals in Game 6, he also made some of the biggest stops of the season to hold off a frenzied Washington team, and his performance in prior Game 7s was fit for a king.  For the Capitals, as ever, the specimen under the microscope was Alex Ovechkin, a raging bull of a player who led the league in scoring during the regular season, tore the Rangers to shreds early in the series, and remarked after Game 6 that his team would face the winner of Tampa and Montreal in the Eastern Conference final. His quiet confidence was branded a “cocky” guarantee; from the way it was discussed, you’d think that he had scaled the Chrysler Building with a bullhorn and a copy of the May 25, 1994, New York Post. “I just said we’re going to New York and finish up the series,” he reiterated on Tuesday, “so that’s what I mean.” With 7:10 to play in the first period Wednesday night, the Capitals won a faceoff in front of the Rangers net, and Ovechkin won a puck battle along the boards. He dished the puck to a teammate, took off across the slot, received a perfect pass from Marcus Johansson, and beat Lundqvist with a shot to the high glove corner that gave Washington a 1-0 lead. (The showdown reminded me of the way Packers cornerback Sam Shields once approvingly described his game-long battle with the Cowboys’ Dez Bryant during the playoffs. “That was good on good,” was how he put it.) Madison Square Garden reacted with such swallowing silence to the 1-0 deficit that Ovechkin’s barbaric yawps were just about all that could be heard on TV.  ??? During Friday night’s Game 5, the Garden crowd had been so nervous and silent as it faced the prospect of elimination that after the game, Rangers radio analyst (and former blue-jeaned Blueshirt) Dave Maloney took it upon himself to implore everyone to put some pep in their step for Game 7. For all the mystique ascribed to the “World’s Most Famous Arena,” its fans — particularly the high-paying ones who populate the place during the playoffs — are sometimes as roundly flat as the Garden’s iconic roof. Much of it is a supply-and-demand issue: The folks who can afford the skyscraper-high StubHub prices sometimes act like the absentee tenants of fancy midtown high-rises: They’re there to see and be seen, but not always to fully engage.1 And when they do, they can get real antsy, real fast. Last night, though, it was hard to blame the natives for getting restless, as the Rangers, down a goal, neglected to take advantage of a series of three second-period power plays. With about 10 ticks left on the second of back-to-back penalties to Capitals defenseman Mike Green and fans making their frustration felt, Miller dished a beautiful diagonal pass to an open Hayes on the left side. Hayes tipped the puck past Braden Holtby’s outstretched pad to tie the game 1-1. It was his second goal of the playoffs — he also won Game 4 against Pittsburgh in overtime in the first round — and the first time a Rangers rookie had scored in Game 7 since 1939. (You know a stat is old-timey when it involves a player named “Muzz.”) The sequence was also a promising glimpse into the Rangers’ future: Miller is 22 years old; Hayes is 23.2  Later, as the two teams came out for the third period, the MSG speakers blared “Right Now.” Don’t wanna wait till tomorrow/ Why put it off another day? But this was Rangers-Capitals, and any outcome would have to wait at least another period. After a scoreless third, everyone got what they had to have known would be coming: sudden-death overtime, the Capitals seeking to outrun their recent history and the Rangers looking to repeat theirs.3 Winner moves on. Loser goes home. Next goal wins. Good on good. ???  Julie Jacobson/AP As the two teams retreated to the locker rooms, it was hard not to think about those Van Halen lyrics. Miss the beat, you lose the rhythm
And nothing falls into place, no
Only missed by a fraction
Slipped a little off your pace, oh At the Capitals practice on Tuesday, Joel Ward got into a compelling and borderline existential discussion with Washington Post columnist Dan Steinberg about the folly of trying to extrapolate meaning from a sport so defined by near misses, tiny fractions, greasy slips, and lucky bounces. “Things happen,” explained Ward, who has won two Game 7s for the Capitals over the past several years but rejected the notion that he had some sort of clutch capability. “You make a pass, it banks off the boards differently, it goes off a guy’s skate, bounces over there. There’s a lot of variables that go into it. … Hockey is the ultimate beast, man. It’s a crazy sport.” The Rangers, who ended their season in overtime to the Devils in the Eastern Conference final in 2012 and lost in the Stanley Cup final last year to the Kings in a double-OT game, seem to have internalized this concept themselves. It’s why they remained confident even after falling behind 3-1 in the series: They knew every game had been oh-so-close, that the score was more a function of luck than a referendum on skill. “When we were down 3-1,” Marc Staal said afterward, “It was kinda, ya know … it really wasn’t that bad. You know, we thought we were right there. A bounce here, and the games change.” He said the locker room before Game 7 overtime was mostly business, with the players more focused on hydrating than hyping. (Ryan McDonagh added that the message was simple. “Let’s make this building erupt,” he said.) In the first few minutes of overtime, it was mostly the Capitals erupting. The line of Ward, Evgeny Kuznetsov, and Jason Chimera put enormous pressure on Lundqvist and the Rangers’ scrambling defensemen; that they didn’t manage to end the game and the series right there seemed to prove Ward’s earlier point. Instead, a routine faceoff in the Rangers’ offensive zone following a Capitals icing midway through the overtime period was what ultimately finished the night. A shot from the point by Dan Girardi ricocheted directly to Derek Stepan, positioned almost exactly where Hayes had been in the second period, and Stepan calmly gathered the fortuitously placed puck, took the shot, and won the game.  Keith Yandle didn’t even see it go in. The towel-waving euphoria from the tense Garden crowd told him everything he needed to know. Ovechkin, stone-faced on the bench, silently unstrapped his helmet. Henrik Lundqvist sprinted up the ice so quickly he nearly tripped.4 For the Capitals, it was one more brutal loss in a long series of them, no matter how hard Trotz insisted that this time was different, that defeat should be “not your undertaker, it should be your teacher.” The Rangers, meanwhile, will now face the Tampa Bay Lightning — a.k.a. Rangers South, given the number of guys on the roster who came from New York. It will be a matchup between two young, speedy, up-and-down teams, one of them trying to return to the Stanley Cup final for the first time since winning it in 2004 and the other hoping to make up for a five-game loss just last season. In the Rangers locker room, above all the bumps and bruises and smiles and sweat, hangs a blank silhouette of the Stanley Cup. After each win, a player tacks up one-sixteenth of the puzzle. Last night, the big broad base of the trophy was complete. That’s only the half of it, though. The cup itself — the part from which everyone longs to sip — remains blank, an empty vessel still waiting to be filled.",2015-05-14T12:37:27+00:00,2015 NHL Playoffs,Baker
37,NHL Playoffs Report: Where the Wild Things Are (It’s Not Pretty) and How the Flames Roasted the Ducks,"Pity the Minnesota Wild fans who bought tickets to Game 3. I can imagine it now: the frustration of the weekend’s 4-1 loss at Game 2 in Chicago; the tiny glimmer of optimism as fans convinced themselves of the potential of a Tuesday-night win; the endless early workweek anticipation, everyone feigning smiles throughout two grueling days of “May the Fourth be with you” and Cinco de Mayo elevator jokes. Surely it would all be worth the distraction and expense; surely the Wild, a 100-point regular-season team that had pretty handily knocked off the St. Louis Blues in Round 1, would get this game and cut the Blackhawks’ 2-0 series lead in half. Surely, at the very least, the fans would get to be inside a loud and proud building for a fun and festive hockey game. Instead, the Wild faithful were force-fed the most unpalatable of outcomes: a slow-drip 1-0 loss, a game that edged the team right up against postseason elimination. Not once did the crowd get to so much as sample the sweet satisfaction of going batshit bonkers for a goal. Instead they gulped as Patrick Kane did Patrick Kane things, scoring from the left faceoff dot late in the first period and celebrating along the boards, right up in their sad faces, his arms spread showtime-wide. (It was Kane’s 11th point this postseason and his 50th in 51 games over the last three years.)  Instead they groaned as several second-period chances passed them by: a fruitless breakaway by Mikael Granlund, a save on Nino Niederreiter, Jason Pominville missing the net completely. As the third period ticked slowly down, they wished they had hockey sticks so they could slam them against the ice or boards in anger. (That’s how the players were coping, anyway.) Everyone unaffiliated with the Blackhawks, from Zach Parise to all the poor souls in the background of this photo, left the arena full of disappointment and existential dread. It was enough to convince a person to just stay home next time around. ??? Gerry Thomas/NHLI But envy the Calgary Flames fans who bought tickets to Game 3! After a 6-1 shellacking in Game 1 at the hands (at the webbed feet?) of the Anaheim Ducks, and a 3-0 shutout in Game 2, the narrative around this matchup was that Anaheim could likely win a second straight series against a Canadian franchise in a clean, no-nonsense sweep. All season long, the Flames had been confounding analysts and onlookers with their inexplicable ability to keep racking up points — to come back from major deficits, to pull things out, to win when all the signs were flashing LOSS in blinking neon script. It finally seemed like the party might be over, that mom and dad had come back early from vacation and were striding up the front walk toward the house. But Brandon Bollig scored two minutes into the game to give Calgary a 1-0 lead and give the Saddledome fans, dressed uniformly in red jerseys (well, mostly), a bit of value for those pricey tickets. The Ducks rallied back to lead 2-1 by the end of the first period, putting the cosmos briefly back in order, and the two teams traded goals in the second. Midway through the third, the Ducks were up 3-2 and appeared to be on their way to a commanding Chicago-like 3-0 series lead. At this point, chaos and disorder began to take hold of the game. Flames rookie Sam Bennett took a shot that Ducks goalie Frederik Andersen kicked away with his pad, but the game was paused so officials could determine whether the puck had actually crossed the goal line. Looking at various camera angles was like gazing into a Magic Eye painting: Depending on how you focused your eyes, different images would appear. From one angle, it seemed incontrovertibly to be a goal; from others, not so much. The NHL determined that due to inconclusive evidence either way, the call on the ice — no goal — would be the one that stood. For some Calgary fans, it felt like a sickening rehash of one of the most infamous moments in Flames lore. For president of hockey operations Brian Burke, it felt like this: GIF Brian Burke reacts pic.twitter.com/OMSu65yHlY — Stephanie Vail (@myregularface) May 6, 2015  Late in the game, a slew of penalties (some procedural, some fishy, some legit) gave Calgary a man advantage in the closing minute. The Flames pulled their goalie so they could skate 5-on-3. Johnny Gaudreau, a 5-foot-9 forward who is one of three finalists for rookie of the year, got the puck and skated into the zone. For a moment, as he reached the hashmarks, he briefly contemplated a pass. Then he took a few more strides and unleashed a Kane-like shot instead, with 20 seconds left to play. Goal; pandemonium; hugs and kisses; fists aloft; tie game. Four minutes and change into overtime, as more controversial calls and non-calls once again piled up, Mikael Backlund — who led all Flames forwards in ice time in the game — took a shot from the high slot that wound up in the Anaheim net for the 4-3 win and a glimmer of hope going forward in the series.  There’s a lot to focus on when you watch the replays: Jiri Hudler’s screen; Gaudreau failing to quite penetrate the celebratory group embrace, like a puppy being squeezed out during a feeding frenzy; Ryan Getzlaf bickering with officials; the rapidly clearing Calgary bench. But what stands out most is the bright red backdrop, the fans who all unwittingly react the exact same way, like one giant, teeming organism. They raise their arms and jump up and down like little children — really, what else is there to do? It’s impossible to know what you’re gonna get when you buy a ticket to a Game 3, but for them, on this night, the getting was good.",2015-05-06T12:38:08+00:00,NHL,Baker
38,This Is Our #Youth: The Kiddie Brigade Breaks Out in the NHL Playoffs,"At the end of Tuesday night’s Inside the NBA, Charles Barkley sneaked in a little hockey talk. He’d just seen the Washington Capitals win in overtime, and he wanted a status update on another game. “Does anybody know what happened to the Blackhawks?” he asked. (They were in the midst of a triple-overtime win as Barkley was staring into the camera.) His cohosts teased him: Shouldn’t he be watching basketball? “I got two eyes, fool!” Barkley fired back. As the show faded out, he had one last off-message. “Come on, Tampa Bay! I ain’t give up on you yet, Coach Coop!” More 2015 NHL Playoffs All our coverage right here! Barkley apparently met Lightning coach Jon Cooper many months ago in Los Angeles, and the two made an impact on one another: Cooper, informed of the shout-out, declared Barkley “one of the greatest guys I’ve ever met” and “a class act.” Midway through last night’s Game 4 in the Tampa Bay–Detroit first-round series, however, it seemed like Barkley’s faith might have been misplaced. The Lightning were down 2-1 in the series, and 2-0 in the game. The Red Wings’ second goal had been the result of a flubbed play by struggling Tampa Bay goalie Ben Bishop. The Detroit fans were giddy: On the television broadcast, you could hear them audibly singing along with the music inside Joe Louis Arena, even after their beloved DJ had cut off a tune. Please tell me whyyyyyyyyyyy, they yelled, a cappella, as if “My Own Worst Enemy” were “The Star-Spangled Banner.” My car is in the front yard, and I …” The second intermission came and went. Fourteen minutes elapsed in the third period, and still Detroit led 2-0. But Tyler Johnson, the undrafted, diminutive Lightning forward who tied with Steven Stamkos for the team scoring lead this regular season, got the puck in the neutral zone, sped over the blue line, cut in toward the Red Wings goal, and went bar-down to give the Lightning life. Just more than a minute later, he made a stunning assist to Ondrej Palat for the game-tying goal.  And two and a half minutes into overtime, Johnson looked just like Stamkos, one-timing the puck into the back of the net from the left side while going down to one knee, both out of exertion and in celebration. Just like that, the Lightning went from left for dead to all tied up 2-2 in the series and heading back home for Game 5. As always: Trust the words of Charles Barkley, particularly when it’s about hockey. ??? John Russell/NHLI At 24 years old, Johnson — who just last season was a finalist for the Calder Trophy, awarded to the league’s best rookie — was actually one of the older players to have a game-changing impact around the NHL last night. With the exception of Daniel Sedin’s game winner to keep the Canucks alive against the Flames, most of the biggest performances came from guys still in their early twenties. In Nashville, the Predators, coming off the rough triple-OT loss in that game Barkley was inquiring about, fought off elimination at the hands of Chicago with a 5-2 win that included a hat trick from 20-year-old Filip Forsberg. It was the first playoff hat trick in Nashville’s history. Sure, one of the goals was an empty-netter. But it was still a bit of a “fuck you” game for Forsberg, and not only toward the Blackhawks: Earlier in the day, when the NHL announced the short list for Calder contention, Forsberg’s name was not called. He’d spent most of the year as a presumptive front-runner, but a late-season slump combined with the ascent of Ottawa’s Mark Stone left the young Swede as the odd man out. What better way to respond to the snub?  If there was any contingent of folks made secretly happy by Forsberg’s Calder omission, it might have been Washington fans: The Capitals drafted him in 2012 but traded him rashly in 2013. More likely, though, Caps supporters had bigger things on their minds, like Evgeny Kuznetsov, the 22-year-old Russian whose two goals and an assist last night led Washington to a 5-1 win and a 3-2 series lead over the Islanders. Kuznetsov batted the puck out of midair; he backhanded it on a breakaway. His enthusiasm was infectious. Kuznetsov captivated Capitals fans long before he even arrived in America. After being drafted in 2010, he was expected to play for a little while in the KHL before coming to D.C. But he remained in Russia for much longer, heightening both the doubt surrounding him and the anticipation. Last spring, he finally joined the team, living with captain Alex Ovechkin and learning the language — Brooks Orpik taught him the phrase “it’s not my first rodeo” — and a new system of play. “When I score I hear loud in the stadium, I feel like crazy and I want to say thanks for all who come in the game,” Kuznetsov said after the game. “More loud than the Islanders game and hope see you next round.” He identified his favorite goal as the one Karl Alzner scored, because it was the game winner.  I can’t say for sure, but I assume Charles Barkley was happy with this particular outcome: Last week, during a radio hit on Mike and Mike, he explained why he was rooting for a Capitals victory. “I’m pulling for Ovechkin,” he said, “so he can get off the list I’m on — never won anything. So I root for Ovechkin.” Barkley wasn’t the only NBA guy with a wandering eye, by the way. “How much fun is the Blackhawk/Predator game?” Phil Jackson tweeted last night. “1/2 period with no stoppage in the 1st after playing over 100 min in OT’s Tues. 1-1 into 3rd.” A few minutes later, with the Predators having grabbed a 4-1 lead, Jackson declared it time for bed. “Look forward to next bout,” he wrote. “#youth#speed.”",2015-04-24T11:10:08+00:00,2015 NHL Playoffs,Baker
39,Requiem for a Dump: Saying Good-bye to the Nassau Coliseum on the Occasion of Rangers-Islanders,"Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum, home of the New York Islanders, is a mosquito trapped in amber. It is a cryogenically frozen head. It is a dead ancient Egyptian ruler impeccably preserved in rags. To step inside the concourse is to enter what seems like a movie set or museum. The floors are dirty and the walls are thickly painted, as if to conceal structural horrors beneath. The roof drips and the seats are stained and mismatched — one fan told me that he jumped out of his chair to cheer a goal once, and the entire thing basically disintegrated beneath him — and the narrow hallway that leads to the ramshackle private suites has the claustrophobic, carpeted ambience of an airport jetway. The food court is in a windowless basement and is as cheery as the lower level of a slated-for-implosion mall. The “beer gardens” have a porta-potty-to-picnic-table ratio of roughly 2-to-1. (A good thing, because the lines for the cramped concourse bathrooms are epic.) The Islanders’ home locker room is smaller than the intentionally cramped visitors’ quarters at most other arenas. All this is why people, most notably WFAN’s Steve Somers, call the place “the Mausoleum.” It’s why Gary Bettman, in 2009, said: “I think it is clear, and I say this perhaps as a matter of observation, and as a matter of fact: There is probably no worse major league facility right now in North America than the Nassau Coliseum.” It is also the most beautiful and perfect sporting arena I have ever been inside. ??? As the forecasts for a “crippling” and “historic” winter apocalypse accumulated on Monday like so many drifts of snow, there seemed to be zero chance that the Islanders and Rangers would be playing Tuesday night. The Coliseum can be tiresome to get to under even the sunniest skies. There’s no easy, one-shot mode of public transportation that deposits you precisely where you want to be — but in the middle of a snowstorm? Fuhgeddaboutit. My own trip out there on Monday afternoon involved two trains, a bus, and a lift from a sympathetic plow driver who spotted me struggling to wheel my suitcase through the Hempstead Turnpike snow. But as school cancellations piled up and Governor Cuomo announced a total shutdown of New York subways and trains, the Islanders and Rangers stubbornly insisted that the show would go on as planned. And how could it not? This is a local hockey rivalry that no one wants to tamper with, especially right now. Rangers-Islanders has always been a noteworthy matchup, but it’s been forever since the two teams have simultaneously been this good. The Rangers, who reached the Stanley Cup final last season, rebounded from a mediocre and injury-slowed start with a 16-5 run between the beginning of December and the All-Star break. The Islanders, meanwhile, have been one of the NHL’s top teams all year, led by a captain so talented that he tied the All-Star Game scoring record last weekend with four goals. (John Tavares somehow didn’t win MVP honors, though that may have been a good thing in terms of preserving family unity.) All this has riled up fans of New York hockey; it’s hard not to daydream about the prospect of a Rangers-Islanders playoff series, which hasn’t taken place in more than 20 years. To look back at the history of the two franchises meeting in the postseason is to get a decent bird’s-eye view of their distant heights. The Islanders beat the Rangers three times in the playoffs in the early ’80s en route to winning three of their four straight Stanley Cups, while the Rangers defeated their Long Island counterparts in their own 1994 championship season. Despite what the marketing departments of the respective teams would like you to believe, all these glories took place a long, long time ago. At Tuesday night’s game, Islanders fans, referring to the two wins they’ve already picked up against the Rangers this year at Madison Square Garden, mocked visiting fans with “You can’t beat us!” A few Blueshirts fans tried to retaliate — “You can’t get a Cup!” — but the taunt died down almost as soon as it began, with everyone remembering that they aren’t exactly ones to talk. ???
 It has been a charmed season for the Islanders. The organization’s false starts and disappointments are legion, from the sale of the team to an outright fraud to the depressing career of former goalie Rick DiPietro to the even more depressing Alexei Yashin trade. But that began to change, albeit slowly, when the Islanders selected John Tavares in 2009 with the draft’s top pick. Tavares was such a standout player that when he turned 14, the Canadian hockey federation granted a special exemption allowing him to be drafted into the Ontario Hockey League a year early. (It was the first case of “exceptional player status,” which has since been granted to three other boys.) A push was made to accelerate him into the NHL draft a year early as well, though that never did pan out. Mike Stobe/NHLI He joined an Islanders team that was clearly ailing but had made several strong draft picks in recent years, from forwards Kyle Okposo and Josh Bailey to defenseman Travis Hamonic. And he made an impact right away, finishing second in rookie scoring and lending a face to a franchise that sorely needed one. Finally in 2011, he made a decisive commitment to the Islanders, inking a six-year, $33 million contract a year before he needed to — despite the complete utter arena chaos and uncertainty then enveloping the team. Owner Charles Wang’s ambitious if overreaching plans to turn the barren, ho-hum landscape surrounding Nassau Coliseum into a major mixed-use development were ultimately no match for the preening and labyrinthine realities of Long Island’s municipal politics. He was unable to push through a number of varying proposals to upgrade the Islanders’ crumbling arena. In the fall of 2012, he announced that the team would finally do what it had been threatened for years: move out of Uniondale, New York, the working-class suburban community that had for so long been the heart of the Islanders’ identity, right down to the team name. The new location: Barclays Center in downtown Brooklyn, home of the Brooklyn Nets and an arena that is so not-optimized for watching hockey that the scoreboard will hang off-center over the ice and a good number of the seats can’t even see one goal. In contrast, you could say that at Nassau Coliseum there really isn’t a bad seat in the house. (Some may argue that’s because they’re all bad, but in all seriousness: Those intimate sight lines can’t be beat.) This is the last season the Islanders will play in their native land, amid their native people, and as with any farewell tour or last hurrah — Teemu Selanne, those last few weeks of college — there’s that desire to delay and deny the end for as long as anyone can. ??? Before Tuesday night’s game, Henrik Lundqvist said that he appreciated the Rangers support he hears when playing in the Coliseum; the stands are always infiltrated by Blueshirts on the occasion of Rangers-Islanders games. But between the snowstorm and the Islanders’ brilliant season, last night’s home team contingent — some of whom could be spotted tailgating over little fires in the icy parking lot — easily drowned out the rowdy Rangers fans. The Islanders had received the nerve-racking news that Okposo, who is second only to Tavares in team scoring and is part of the Isles’ corps (and core) of “homegrown” players, would be out six to eight weeks with an injury. But the current iteration of the Islanders has blended these raised-in-the-system guys with a savvy mix of free agents and additions. Defensemen Johnny Boychuk and Nick Leddy, respective Cup winners in Boston and Chicago, were picked up to solidify the team’s blue line. Goaltender Jaroslav Halak was acquired after excelling in St. Louis. Mike Stobe/NHLI And so it was fitting that Mikhail Grabovski, the oft-maligned yet effective former Maple Leafs (and, briefly, Capitals) forward whom the Islanders acquired this offseason, would make his return from injury by filling in for Okposo. Grabovski’s first-period goal was like a brief capsule of the Islanders’ season: Tavares carried the puck up the ice and into the zone, newcomer Boychuk and 2008 Isles draft pick Bailey played tic-tac-toe, and Grabovski was there to tap it in. Matt Martin extended the lead to 2-0 early in the second period when he netted a rebound past Lundqvist, and the Nassau crowd went bonkers. (My favorite fans, by the way, were a foursome of men from Denmark all wearing no. 51 for their countryman Frans Nielsen.) Ryan Strome was credited for a goal that deflected off Rangers captain Ryan McDonagh’s stick, and by the time Tavares scored his 22nd of the season on the power play to give the Islanders a 4-0 lead, I could see a few Rangers fans being escorted out of the stands by Coliseum security. One had on a Rod Gilbert jersey; the other was wearing a fur trapper hat. Carl Hagelin’s goal with eight seconds left spoiled Halak’s deserving shutout — indeed, it was the Islanders goalie who had largely kept his team in the game, despite the lopsided score — but otherwise, it was a perfect evening for the Islanders fans who braved the roads to fill the building. ??? It’s impossible to hear the roar of the crowd at Nassau1 without trying to imagine what on earth the place must have been like back in the Islanders’ dynasty days of the early 1980s. (With that electric-guitar-heavy goal song they’ve got going on, you don’t have to try too hard.) An usher I spoke with told me that recently some fans in his section were chirped for wearing brand-new jerseys during a Devils game. He said that made him happy: Islanders fans have been waiting forever to be accused of being bandwagon jumpers. That old vehicle’s been languishing in the shop for years. It’s bittersweet, and just so Islanders, that the embattled team’s brightest and most fun season in ages is also, in some respects, its last. Sure, the players will love the cushier digs at Barclays Center, and the fans probably won’t mind having actual options for where to grab a drink before a game. A new generation of Islanders supporters will be born. (Their names might all be Liam and Olivia.) But the number of truly distinct places like Nassau Coliseum in professional sports has long been dwindling down to nothing — in the NHL, only Edmonton and Detroit have rinks of similar feel and vintage, and those aren’t long for the world — and there’s something to be said for the place’s intoxicating cocktail of inertia and proud identity. I’m a Rangers fan, for crying out loud, and I still left the game hoping against hope that the last time the Islanders skate off the ice at Nassau Coliseum, it’s with a Stanley Cup. And as the Islanders gathered at center ice to salute the fans after the game, the song “On to the Next One” blared from the PA system. That will be the case soon enough. Sitting there in my rickety seat, though, it was hard not to feel that it shouldn’t happen just yet.",2015-01-29T09:53:56+00:00,NHL,Baker
40,NFL Week 8 Picks: The Weight of the Interim Label,"The Patriots made short work of Dan Campbell’s Coach of the Year campaign on Thursday night, handing Miami’s interim coach his first defeat with a 36-7 rout in Foxborough. There’s no shame in losing to the undefeated Patriots, of course, and Dolphins fans have to be encouraged with how their team has responded under Campbell after getting off to a sleepy 1-3 start under deposed former coach Joe Philbin. There’s still plenty of time to observe Campbell and figure out whether he’s the right man for the job, but he’s certainly shown enough promise early as an interim coach to engender thoughts about giving him the permanent gig at the end of the season. Is that a good idea? It’s weirdly both somehow fair and unfair to be an interim coach in the NFL. The disadvantages, of course, are obvious. You’re taking over in midseason with limited ability to change schemes and install new concepts. While most interim coaches are already on staff and therefore already familiar and comfortable with the people around them, there’s virtually no way to dramatically change your personnel on or off the field in the way that you can while taking over as a permanent coach during the offseason. You’re also almost always taking over a team that is demoralized, with little hope of competing the rest of the way. The cards are stacked against you. The flip side is that teams that are bad enough to get a coach fired in midseason are often playing so poorly that they’re likely to get better by sheer regression back toward the mean. To some extent that’s true of Campbell in Miami. The Dolphins forced just three takeaways during their first four games, then picked up four in their ensuing win over the Titans during Campbell’s debut. They were dead last in conversion rate on third and fourth downs on offense, including a staggering 1-for-10 figure on fourth down, in the first four games. Stuff like that isn’t likely to recur over any sort of large sample. The soft factors also went Campbell’s way. He started with layups against the Titans and Texans, although Philbin also lost to the Jaguars during his 1-3 start. Campbell also sent out a superior roster after the bye, with top left tackle Branden Albert returning to the fold and star pass-rusher Cameron Wake recovering from a hamstring injury that had badly limited his effectiveness during the start of the season. Wake had zero sacks and a lone quarterback hit before the bye; after Philbin left, he racked up six sacks and four forced fumbles across his next two games. And sadly, Wake may be done: After picking up a sack on Thursday night, he appeared to suffer a third-quarter Achilles injury that could end his season. This happens all the time with interim coaches. They take over a team at rock bottom, preside over a dead cat bounce, and win the full-time job. How do they do after taking over as the full-time coach? Usually, not very well at all. Since 1990, most interim coaches have failed when given the permanent job, with one glaring exception: The successful interim coach is Jeff Fisher, who was promoted in midseason by the Oilers and left 16 years later as the coach of the Titans after winning 142 games and coming within a yard of sending a Super Bowl into overtime. Remove Fisher from the equation and those other coaches were a combined 157-250-1 (.386) with the permanent gig, and the only other coaches who would qualify as remotely successful don’t entirely fit this criteria. Mike Tice was promoted with all of one game to go in the 2001 season, and Jason Garrett was well known as Dallas’s head coach-in-waiting after being given a massive raise to keep him from taking the head job in Baltimore or Atlanta before 2008. It would be unfair to use this to prove that the Dolphins shouldn’t give Campbell the job. The Fisher example counts, of course, and there were a number of successful head coaches who initially won their jobs as interim figures in the ’80s, including Marv Levy, Marty Schottenheimer, and Raymond Berry. The sample of interim coaches isn’t enormous by any means. At the same time, it’s hard to truly prove that Campbell’s the right coach for Miami in the long term, even if the Dolphins have improved since he took over. The argument that he wanted them to be a tougher football team, as if that simply hadn’t occurred to Philbin, is specious. The run-happy approach Campbell espoused had much to do with the positive game situations his teams faced during his 2-0 start. The Dolphins presumably wanted to be just as tough and physical running the football yesterday and still mustered only 15 yards on 13 carries, with an early deficit leading to 49 dropbacks from Ryan Tannehill. That’s the sort of day that got Philbin fired. The truth, sadly, is that we don’t know much at all about whom NFL teams should hire as their head coaches. We don’t learn much about that during interim gigs; hell, we don’t learn much about it from coaches who get jobs for multiple years. Think of the league’s best coaches now; many of them were major question marks earlier in their careers. Bill Belichick was fired by the Browns and treated like a pariah. He took over in New England for Pete Carroll, who was too nice after Bill Parcells’s reign. Bruce Arians was run out of town by the Steelers because his offenses weren’t physical enough. The Bears chose not to renew Ron Rivera’s contract as defensive coordinator, in part because they didn’t want to give him a raise. Campbell could be the next Jeff Fisher or he could just as easily be the next Mike Singletary. We don’t know a lot about whom to hire as a head coach. In the abstract, recent history tells us it’s easier to get fooled by short-term success by an interim coach than it is to find a keeper. ??? Let’s run through the Week 8 picks. I had the Pats last night. As always, these are the consensus lines listed at VegasInsider.com. Home teams are in CAPS. CHIEFS (-4) over Lions (in London) Kansas City’s defense is finally coming around after an ugly start to the season. The Chiefs allowed 30-plus points in three straight games, but given that those performances came against the Broncos, Packers, and Bengals, you can understand why the points were flowing. (The Broncos supplemented their haul with a return touchdown.) Over their past three games, with the likes of Sean Smith (suspension), Dontari Poe (back surgery), and Eric Berry (recovery from chemotherapy) rounding into form, they’ve allowed a total of 47 points to the Bears, Vikings, and Steelers. Opposing offenses scored touchdowns on 11 of their 12 trips to the red zone during that ugly three-game opening stretch; in the three ensuing games, they’ve scored just three touchdowns in eight tries. BEARS (-1) over Vikings The Vikings are 4-2, but advanced metrics aren’t especially impressed. DVOA rates Minnesota out as the fifth-worst team in football, well below a pair of one-win teams in the Ravens (18th) and Titans (22nd). A good chunk of why DVOA is so skeptical: strength of schedule. The Vikings have had the easiest slate of opponents in football this season, having lost to the 6-0 Broncos while otherwise facing teams that are a combined 8-27, including a pair of matchups against the lowly Lions. They were blown out in Week 1 by a 49ers team that has been outscored 177-83 since. A correction is coming: The Vikings play the league’s second-toughest schedule from here on out. The good news, if you’re a Vikings fan or an invested fantasy football participant, is that change isn’t about to show up this week, given that the Bears are one of the four teams in the league below Minnesota in Football Outsiders’s rankings. Chicago has also sported the league’s fourth-worst run defense this season per DVOA, which should make a shrimp-free Adrian Peterson happy. Buccaneers (+7) over FALCONS The Bucs produced one of the worst losses you’ll see in a typical season last Sunday. They led Washington 24-0 in the second quarter before allowing Kirk Cousins to launch a furious comeback, eventually giving away the lead with 24 seconds left. By Chase Stuart’s game scripts methodology, Tampa Bay led this game by 9.3 points and still lost. Depending on your viewpoint, that’s either the worst blown lead of the season or the most impressive comeback of the year. There were good takeaways for Tampa Bay, even in the loss, but what worried me as someone who isn’t at all invested in the Bucs is what went down in terms of penalties. As much as you’ve heard that Rex Ryan is having trouble keeping referees from flagging the Bills, what the Buccaneers did last Sunday was worse. Washington picked up seven first downs by penalties, as the Bucs racked up 16 penalties for 142 yards. It’s one thing to get penalties when you’re playing tight coverage or getting narrowly caught running successful pick plays. That wasn’t the case with the Buccaneers. Tampa Bay picked up four unnecessary roughness penalties, including two from William Gholston, who threw in a roughing-the-passer call for good measure. Another one of the unnecessary roughness calls went on rookie guard Ali Marpet, who committed three different penalties on two consecutive possessions. Marpet was one of five Buccaneers offensive linemen to be flagged during the game; the only Bucs lineman who made it through the game scot-free was center Joe Hawley. The biggest call, an offensive-pass-interference flag on Mike Evans, wiped away the star receiver’s second touchdown of the day. This is a serious problem for the Bucs, and it had been brewing even before Sunday’s disastrous loss. Tampa Bay is actually averaging more penalties per game (12.7) than the Bills (12.6), with nobody else averaging as many as 11 so far this season. And it’s hard to see the problem disappearing anytime soon, given that Tampa Bay was tied with San Francisco as the league’s most-penalized team during Lovie Smith’s debut season in 2014. Good teams can commit a ton of penalties and still succeed — the Patriots and Seahawks were each among the 10 most penalized teams of 2014 — but the Bucs have a much smaller margin for error. SAINTS (-3) over Giants The Saints have a fun new wrinkle: the jumbo package. After acquiring Michael Hoomanawanui from the Patriots earlier this season, the Saints have shifted their personnel and made more use of three-tight-end sets, mixing Hoomanawanui, an excellent blocker, with starter Benjamin Watson and pass-catcher Josh Hill. None of the three tight ends is a star by himself, but the grouping allows the Saints to supplement their subpar offensive line and dictate opposing defensive packages to their liking. It’s also done wonders for their running game. The Saints have been the ninth-best team in football in terms of expected points added per running play in their three-tight-end package; they’re the 10th-worst team in the league in the same category with two or fewer tight ends in the lineup. Over the past three weeks, the Saints have rolled three tight ends out onto the field for a whopping 45 offensive snaps. That’s more than twice as frequently as the second-heaviest user of the tactic over that same time frame, the 49ers (22 snaps). To put it in context, the Saints went with three tight ends just 13 times during the first four weeks of the year, and as recently as 2012, they went with that jumbo package a total of 16 times all season. Teams will adjust to what the Saints are doing, but it’s given what had been somewhat of a staid offense some unlikely new life. RAMS (-8) over 49ers The Rams look like a different offense with Todd Gurley around, as Robert Mays covered on Thursday. They’re about to face the league’s worst defense, with the 49ers 28th in run defense DVOA and dead last against the pass through seven weeks. And that’s before even considering that an offensive line that has been struggling mightily on the interior will be up against Aaron Donald this week:  Cardinals (-6) over BROWNS The surprise package of Cleveland’s season has been tight end Gary Barnidge, who has been unreal after taking a bigger role in the offense in Week 3. Prorate Barnidge’s past five games to a full season and he posts a 93-1,469-16 line. Rob Gronkowski’s past 16 regular-season games, for reference, have combined for a 96-1,429-15 line. At the very least, Barnidge deserves honorary Gronkowski brother status. Doesn’t it seem like Gary would fit right in with Gordie, Chris, Dan, Glenn, and Rob? And is it possible to even fathom what a Gronkowski sister would have turned out like? A CrossFit Amy Schumer? You can imagine her marrying John Cena, actually. It’s fun to see a relatively anonymous NFL veteran like Barnidge step into the limelight with a molten stretch of play, and he has the size and hands to be a meaningful part of Cleveland’s passing attack, but it’s going to be close to impossible to keep putting up Gronk-level numbers for a full season. And Arizona looms as a large obstacle in Barnidge’s way. The Cardinals have the league’s best DVOA against tight ends and have held them to just 40.4 yards per game this season without allowing a single touchdown. No tight end has even managed to top 53 receiving yards against Deone Bucannon, Kevin Minter, and the rest of Arizona’s coverage units so far this season. STEELERS (-1.5) over Bengals Ben Roethlisberger will make his return for the Steelers this week, just in time for what may very well be the most important game played in the AFC North this season. The Steelers went a surprising 3-2 without their star quarterback, including the win they earned against the Rams after Big Ben was injured midgame. They really should have gone 4-1, given that they had Baltimore down to a fraction of a percentage point of win expectancy in the fourth quarter, only for since-released kicker Josh Scobee to miss two critical field goals. Those kicks came in Week 4, which was the peak of the public’s kicker hysteria. Kickers went 60-for-74 (81.1 percent) that week, as some wondered what had gone wrong for the league’s many specialists. Since then? Kickers have quietly gone back to work and performed just as well as we would have expected. They’ve combined to go 150-for-175 from Week 5 on, an 85.7 percent clip that compares favorably to their 84.2 percent success rate from the 2014 season. The lesson, as always: Don’t overreact to one bad week of anything. RAVENS (-3) over Chargers If there were ever a week for the Ravens to get on track on offense — even with Steve Smith Sr. hitting the injury report on Thursday with a knee issue — it would be this week against the Chargers. I wrote about how dreadful San Diego’s defense has looked inside Monday’s Top 25 ballot, and the Chargers aren’t getting any healthier. The Chargers are likely going to be without their best defensive back (Eric Weddle) and their top two coverage linebackers (Manti Te’o and Denzel Perryman), on Sunday, while starting nose tackle Sean Lissemore is a question mark with a hamstring injury. The 30th-ranked Chargers defense wasn’t especially good when everybody was healthy; it has the potential to be truly ugly with its middle sliced to pieces. Titans (+3.5) over TEXANS It’s fair to say that Arian Foster’s season-ending torn Achilles further reduces the ceiling of what Houston’s offense can do. Foster single-handedly carried the offense at times last year, and while DeAndre Hopkins took a step forward last year and has emerged as a star this season, Foster was supposed to be the other piece capable of allowing the Texans to overcome their woes at quarterback. That may be true, but there shouldn’t be a dramatic drop-off between what the Texans do without Foster and how they looked with him in the lineup during the 2015 season, because Foster wasn’t great before the injury. Admittedly, suggesting that the Texans will be just as good on offense as they have been during this dreadful season is the coldest of comforts, but Foster wasn’t helping all that much. The longtime star back rushed back from an offseason groin injury and wasn’t 100 percent. Foster should be applauded for his toughness and was getting better each week, but he had averaged just 2.6 yards per carry on his 63 rush attempts in 2015, fumbling twice in four games. Foster had really been most effective as a safety valve in the passing game, truthfully. Given that Tennessee sports the league’s third-worst run defense this year, the Texans might actually not have a ton of trouble running the ball with Alfred Blue as their primary back this week. RAIDERS (+3) over Jets As impressive as the Oakland offense has looked at times this season, there’s a noticeable relationship between how they’ve performed and the quality of the opposing defense. They dropped a season-high 37 points on the Chargers last week, who are 30th in defensive DVOA. They also put 37 on the Ravens, who are 23rd in DVOA. They got to 27 and 20, respectively, against two low-ranked defenses in Cleveland and Chicago. Derek Carr & Co. have otherwise played two games against above-average defenses so far, and things haven’t gone well. They were shut out for the first three quarters of the season opener against the Bengals before two garbage-time touchdowns got them to 13 points. And then, against the top-ranked Broncos defense in Week 5, the Raiders scored just 10 points. The only defense that’s managed to come close to the Broncos in DVOA so far this season is the one the Raiders are about to face this weekend in Oakland, Todd Bowles’s Jets team. Amari Cooper versus Darrelle Revis will be worth the price of admission on its own. Seahawks (-6) over COWBOYS The Seahawks have feasted on quarterbacks like Matt Cassel over the past three-plus years. Ryan Lindley may actually be buried at CenturyLink Field, which is distressing, because Ryan Lindley is still alive. But two of the best single-game QBRs against the Seahawks during this run have come from also-ran quarterbacks. Mike Glennon posted a 79.2 QBR, the sixth-best figure against the Seahawks in a start since 2012, when he nearly led the Bucs to an upset win against Seattle in 2013. And Austin Davis, of all people, went 17-of-20 for 155 yards and two touchdowns in posting a 97.7 QBR in St. Louis’s 28-26 win over Seattle last year. It’s tempting to just look at the Seattle defense and Matt Cassel and automatically assume that the Seahawks will win by all the points. And a good amount of the time, that logic will check out. Just not every time. Packers (-2.5) over BRONCOS The Packers and Broncos have identical 6-0 records. Not much else about the two teams suggests that they’re very similar at all: DVOA basically has the Broncos in the same space as the 3-4 Bills; the Packers simply have been at another level so far this season. Colts (+7) over PANTHERS It’s not exactly a secret that the weakest spot in Carolina’s excellent pass defense is at safety, where Roman Harper is an inconsistent run-thumper who often gets lost in coverage. And the best way to attack safeties is to throw downfield. A lot. On passes defined by the NFL to be “short,” throws within 15 yards of the line of scrimmage, the Panthers are third in QBR. On those deeper throws, though, the Panthers haven’t been quite as effective, as they’re currently 10th in QBR on passes that travel 16 or more yards in the air. I know that 10th isn’t exactly anything to slouch about, but when you’re trying to poke holes in this defense, you take what you can find. The old Colts would have been able to take advantage of those holes deep in the secondary far more frequently. Andrew Luck posted a sterling 97.2 QBR on throws traveling 16-or-more yards in the air last season, the fourth-best figure in football. Now? A likely injured Luck can’t stay upright and struggles to find his receivers for big gains. He’s posted a 51.9 QBR on those same passes in 2015, the seventh-worst figure in football, with five interceptions across just 48 pass attempts. (Luck threw just two picks on 126 such passes in 2014.) If the Colts want to compete on Monday night, they’ll have to look more like the 2014 Colts in terms of attacking their defensive opposition downfield. Or book a game against the AFC South instead.

41,The NFL Top 25 Rankings,"It’s about time for an NFL Top 25 ballot. I’m jealous of college football, where the nation’s finest coaching assistants and interns submit votes each week on behalf of their institution’s head coaches to generate something resembling a national consensus power rankings. I want it for the professional game, too, if only because it’s fun to watch other people furiously overreact to last week’s games or get angry when power rankings don’t just rank teams by their win-loss record. There’s not enough NFL content is what I’m saying, apparently. So until we get the NFL coaches (or their assistants, or their assistants’ assistants) involved, I guess I’ve just got to file a ballot myself. I’ve run through and pieced together a 25-team ballot. My logic in ranking teams was to sort through what they’ve each done on a cumulative basis over the course of the season, not project what they’ll do over the remainder of the year. These will look different if you revisit them with hindsight after Week 17. Although it’s not necessarily a team’s fault that it struggled through injuries, I’m not giving out any discounts or apologies for injuries that affected teams here. The idea is that every squad ahead of a given team in the rankings would be favored against that team on a neutral field based on what they’ve done over the first seven weeks of the season, while every team below our selected squad would be an underdog. There will naturally be situations where one team that beat a second team will be ranked under that team here, because what that team did over the other five or six games matters, too. The Saints beat the Falcons, but when you include how they each performed over the rest of their respective schedules, New Orleans isn’t better than Atlanta. I’ll also mention a bit about how each team did in Week 7 as warranted. Naturally, with a 32-team league, there were seven teams left out of the assortment. If you like AFC South teams, you’re going to find them here! That group included Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit, Houston, Jacksonville, San Francisco, and Tennessee. The Bucs were blown out by a bad Titans team in Week 1, but since then, they’ve actually been a competent-looking, competitive football team, which is a step up from last season. They were unlucky to lose by two scores to the Panthers in a Week 4 game where Ed Dickson managed to catch and return a fumble on the fly for a 57-yard score. Their schedule has been stunningly easy, but that was clearly going to be the case before the season. It would have been nice for the Bucs to pick up a rare road win at Washington on Sunday, especially given that they had a 97.4 percent win expectancy1 after going up 24-0 in the second quarter. Their defense subsequently collapsed in the red zone, allowing Washington to score four touchdowns and a field goal on its five subsequent trips inside the 20, while penalties and drops held the Bucs to two field goals on their red zone possessions. The Bucs probably could have sealed it on a third-and-goal try from the 1-yard line, only for Charles Sims to be stuffed for a loss of 2 yards. That took away the realistic possibility of trying to convert on fourth down and forced Tampa Bay to kick a field goal to go up six, which then incentivized Jay Gruden to go for a game-winning touchdown instead of a game-tying field goal, and when the Bucs laid off of Washington’s receivers, that’s exactly what Gruden ended up getting. The one promising thing both teams can take away is that this ended up as something resembling a quarterback duel between two very questionable decision-makers. Jameis Winston and Kirk Cousins combined to throw 69 passes without a single interception, and they were each among the top six in QBR; Winston was third, with a career-high QBR of 88.2, while Cousins finished sixth at 78.7 before getting fiery after the game: Kirk Cousins after beating the Eagles vs. Kirk Cousins after beating the Bucs. https://t.co/WoB7bBZPaC — Kelyn Soong (@KelynSoong) October 26, 2015 The season is slipping away for the Chargers, who quietly have one of the worst defenses in all of football. After allowing the Raiders to score on their first seven possessions en route to a 37-29 loss on Sunday, John Pagano’s group has now allowed 24 points or more in each of its first seven contests this year. They’re only the third team in the past 25 years to do that. With Eric Weddle injured, the Chargers again had to turn to Jimmy Wilson for meaningful snaps, and he was dreadful. Even worse, other teams know he’s bad and go after him. Clive Walford beat him for an early touchdown. Amari Cooper stole an interception away from Wilson for a 44-yard reception and then juked him into oblivion on a long touchdown off of a screen. Brandon Flowers, who stabilized the secondary last year, is also struggling. This is a flawed football team right now and when the offense turns the ball over (as it did early on Sunday), it’s not going to beat many teams. It took Landry Jones making his first career start, but the Chiefs finally broke their losing streak with their best defensive performance of the season against Pittsburgh. A defense that had just six takeaways in six games forced three Steelers turnovers, although it’s also fair to say that they rode their luck, given how Eric Berry’s interception was bobbled by Antonio Brown. The Steelers had seven different drives end inside Kansas City territory, and while the Chiefs continued to settle for field goals in the red zone early, they finally came away with a pair of touchdowns late to seal up their second win of the season. After understandably cranky Bills fans spent most of their Sunday morning wishing that they hadn’t woken up early to watch EJ Manuel on Yahoo while complaining about how the team had dealt away Matt Cassel and a seventh-rounder for a fifth-round pick, Cowboys fans who felt hopeless with Brandon Weeden under center must have been excited for the debut of their new quarterback. Well, sometimes the grass is just as brown on the other side, in part because Matt Cassel has scattered passes across its surface. While he made a few nice throws downfield, he continued to make killer mistakes under pressure, including a bizarre arm punt in the third quarter for one of his three picks. Over the past four seasons, Cassel has thrown 28 picks in 629 attempts, a 4.5 percent interception rate. Manuel isn’t good, but even after a brutal two-pick stretch in the first half yesterday, he’s thrown 15 picks on 521 attempts, an interception rate of 2.9 percent. Sunday was the sort of game Mickey Loomis imagined the Saints putting together as he tried to rebuild the team on the fly this offseason. They hassled the embattled Andrew Luck throughout the first half, sacking him twice and knocking him down on four other occasions, eventually finishing with four sacks, 10 knockdowns, and 12 passes defensed. The Saints forced three turnovers during the half, two of which were Luck interceptions, including a pick on a brutally underthrown ball in the red zone to keep the Colts off the scoreboard at halftime. And while the Saints defense allowed three second-half touchdowns in a game that was never in danger, Mark Ingram led the charge on a rushing attack that garnered 183 yards on 36 carries. That’s more than the Saints had mustered across their previous two games combined. They even showed the Colts how to run a fake, with Luke McCown setting up a touchdown with a 25-yard throw on a fake field goal. As for the Colts, well, their saving grace is the AFC South. Sweeping the worst division in football, albeit by a combined 12 points, was probably enough to win Indy the division as long as the Colts don’t entirely implode. They have an 85.2 percent chance of making the playoffs, per ESPN’s Football Power Index, which seems unfair for a team that has never looked good at any point this season. They also travel to Carolina to play the undefeated Panthers next week on Monday Night Football and host the undefeated Broncos before their Week 10 bye. Jim Irsay may be coaching the team by then. Getty Images There’s the makings of a competitive football team here, and the Raiders really embarrassed the Chargers in what amounted to a Raiders home game in San Diego on Sunday afternoon. They’re really controlling the line of scrimmage well, with Reggie McKenzie’s investments on both sides of the football paying off up front. The Raiders were seventh in rush defense DVOA and 17th in total defensive DVOA heading into the Chargers game, and those figures should improve after this week. And I like Bill Musgrave’s game plans for Derek Carr, with a healthy mix of screens with back-shoulder throws playing to both Carr’s arm strength and the physical capabilities of Amari Cooper and Michael Crabtree. Oh, by the way, Michael Crabtree’s back! He’s on pace for an 88-catch, 1,016-yard campaign, which isn’t bad at all for a receiver who could get only $1.3 million guaranteed from the Raiders this offseason. There’s always weird stuff happening here — I don’t know how many other teams would see Washington cut cornerback David Amerson and then essentially immediately insert him into their starting lineup like the Raiders have — but the Raiders are no laughingstock in 2015. It didn’t take one horrific quarter in London for us to realize that EJ Manuel was a disaster. That’s nothing new. Is it time to start wondering whether this Bills defense is going to be as great as it seemed after Week 1? It’s unfair to say that it allowed 34 points to the Jaguars on Sunday, given that Jacksonville took a pair of Manuel errors to the house in the second quarter, but the Bills still allowed 20 points on offense to one of the league’s lesser lights and haven’t been great most of the way. Since Andrew Luck left town, Buffalo has allowed opposing passers to post a 55.3 QBR, which is 16th in the league over that time frame. And given how bad Luck and the Indy offense have been all season, a dominant performance by Buffalo’s defense against Indianapolis doesn’t seem quite as impressive now as it did in September. Buffalo’s run defense was 25th in DVOA heading into the Jags game and then got gashed by T.J. Yeldon, although the Bills did come up with a true four-play goal-line stand when the Jaguars decided to viciously attack the wall socket with a fork and ran Toby Gerhart four times in a row from the 1-yard line. What really would concern me as a Bills fan would be the takeaways drying up, and that’s what has happened. After eight takeaways in their first three games, the Bills have just three in the ensuing four contests. Their only takeaway on Sunday was critical, with Corey Graham taking a horrific Blake Bortles throw to the house for a brief fourth-quarter lead, but Rex Ryan’s defenses need takeaways to live. Every team is better when it gets two takeaways or more in a game, but Rex’s teams thrive. Since 2009, NFL teams not coached by Rex are 1,020-468-1 (.685) when they force two turnovers or more in a given game. Rex’s teams are a combined 33-9 (.786) in those games. I wrote about why Baltimore’s record is misleading last week, and the Ravens still haven’t suited up for Week 7 yet, so there’s not much to add here. And just like the Saints, the Rams played their prototypical game in beating an overmatched AFC team on Sunday, comfortably handling the Browns. The Rams housed Cleveland’s third play from scrimmage on a Taylor Gabriel fumble and subsequently played field position against a team that ran only six plays inside the St. Louis red zone all day. They beat up poor Josh McCown (who didn’t help by apparently Frerotting himself on the sidelines early on), sacking him four times and knocking him down on seven occasions. Most excitingly, of course, they got Nick Foles out of the way and just handed the ball to Todd Gurley, who carried the ball 19 times for 128 yards and scored twice. It was Gurley’s third consecutive big game to start his career, which is pretty remarkable. The only other rookie running backs to pick up 125 rushing yards or more in three consecutive games are Mike Anderson, Franco Harris, Cadillac Williams, and Eric Dickerson. Not only is Gurley now in that group, but he’s done it in his first three NFL starts. What a superstar. He’s no Dan Campbell, though! Miami’s interim head coach has won his first two games by a combined 46 points, as the Dolphins went up 41-0 at halftime on Sunday before eventually settling for a 44-26 blowout of the Texans. The headlines after that game have revolved around Arian Foster’s likely torn Achilles, but plenty of credit should go to Campbell for the return to accountability that has taken place on his watch. A Dolphins team that looked uninterested and overwhelmed under Joe Philbin suddenly looks vicious and dynamic, even if some of that is unquestionably a product of playing the AFC South over the past two weeks. But while Campbell is off to a great start, he shouldn’t get all the credit: The placebo effect of a coaching change isn’t enough to turn Lamar Miller into prime Marshall Faulk. Even more promisingly, the Miami defense has sprung to life. Cameron Wake’s return to health has been an enormous game-changer for the Dolphins; after his game-impacting four-sack performance against the Titans last week, the former CFL star chipped in with two more strip-sacks on Sunday. Ndamukong Suh also chipped in with his first two sacks as a Dolphins player. If Miami had fallen on even one of the four fumbles during Sunday’s game, it might have built an even bigger lead. We’ll see how much impact Campbell’s really had during their upcoming three-game road trip, when the Dolphins face the Patriots, Bills, and Eagles. Speaking of the devil, those Eagles laid an egg on offense Sunday night, as the Panthers held them to 16 points even though Philly’s impressive defense picked off Cam Newton three times. An offensive line that lost star left tackle Jason Peters to back spasms during the first half was overmatched all night, allowing five sacks and nine quarterback knockdowns on 54 dropbacks. Philly did run the ball 30 times for 177 yards, but much of that success came on a beautiful counter off an outside zone by Ryan Mathews for a 63-yard touchdown. Otherwise, the Eagles were below 4 yards per attempt. Sam Bradford remains frustrating. He didn’t get a ton of help on Sunday, as his receivers dropped seven of his 49 pass attempts, but Bradford rarely puts throws in the spots where they need to be. (In other words, his receivers bail him out with catches that other quarterbacks don’t always get.) Against a team whose biggest weakness as a pass defense remains its safeties, Bradford rarely challenged the Panthers downfield, throwing 20 yards or more in the air just twice on those 46 attempts. Fortunately, thanks to its impressive defense and the frustrating NFC East, Philly is still well positioned to make the playoffs, with FPI giving the Eagles a 59.5 percent shot of claiming the East … Al Bello/Getty Images … I just think that the Giants are a tiny bit better, even if the Eagles did beat them pretty handily last week in Philly. Their offense is far more consistent, although the Giants have unquestionably been riding the wave of a defensive/special teams bubble. After scoring on an interception return and a kickoff return during Sunday’s victory over Dallas, the Giants have scored three return touchdowns and taken a fourth return inside the 1-yard line against the Cowboys during their two matchups this season. After Sunday, the Giants have ended exactly 20 percent of opposition drives with takeaways in 2015, which places them alongside the Jets, Eagles, and Broncos for the best turnover percentage on defense in football. That’s way up from their league-average rate of 13.2 percent in 2014. I’m skeptical they’ll be able to sustain that with such a rudimentary pass rush, but Steve Spagnuolo has done more magical things before. What the Vikings have done to Matthew Stafford during their two games against the Lions borders on criminal brutality. After knocking him down eight times and sending him to the X-ray machine postgame with chest and rib wounds in Week 2, Minnesota sent him back to the X-ray room on Sunday with a possible hand injury. That came about after a seven-sack, 13-hit mauling from the league’s most underrated front seven, including a two-sack, three-knockdown day from rookie middle linebacker Eric Kendricks. This wasn’t even one of those games where the Lions send Stafford back to throw 60 times and let him take his licks; he dropped back only 34 times. He hit the deck on nearly 40 percent of his dropbacks, which is one of the highest rates you’ll ever see. I’m not sure how they’ve escaped the Grantland NFL Podcast jinx so far, but the Vikings are a fun, fun team. The loss to Kansas City on Sunday was the Steelers’ worst defeat of the season, but this was with their third-string quarterback under center. The Steelers still averaged 6.1 yards per carry and stifled the Chiefs in the red zone, holding them to three field goals until the dam broke with a pair of late touchdowns. As I wrote about last Monday, they’ve been impressive enough without Ben Roethlisberger to really raise expectations for what they can do when he returns to the lineup, which could happen as early as this week, when Pittsburgh begins a three-game home stand with a matchup against the Bengals. On bye this week, the Broncos remain one of the more unimpressive teams in league history to start 6-0. They’ve won their six games by a combined 37 points, the worst point differential since the merger for a team that started 6-for-6. They’re six points worse than the 2000 Vikings, who went 5-5 the rest of the way. The same is true of the 1985 Rams, but the only other team since 1970 to start 6-0 that also failed to outscore the opposition by at least 50 points in those six games was a team Peyton Manning will look back upon very fondly. That team was the 2006 Colts, who finished 12-4 and eventually gave Manning his only Super Bowl ring. The Jets gave a good account of themselves during their 30-23 loss to the Patriots on Sunday, giving New England probably the closest game it’s had all season until a blown coverage on Rob Gronkowski gave the Pats some breathing room in the fourth quarter. The Patriots responded to the absent Dion Lewis and a dominant Jets run defense by breaking out their pass-heavy attack, with Tom Brady throwing the ball 54 times. He finished 34-of-54 for 355 yards with two scores and three sacks, although those numbers were depressed in part by a Patriots teammate. The returning Brandon LaFell had one of the worst games you’ll ever see from a receiver, mishandling no fewer than six passes (including three official drops) during a two-catch, eight-target day. The disappointing thing for the Jets is that they weren’t able to run the ball better. Their recipe for beating the Patriots has to be heavy pressure on Brady and long possessions to chew up clock, and they didn’t get the latter on Sunday. The combination of Chris Ivory and Zac Stacy carried the ball 24 times for just 60 yards, with Ivory suffering from a tweaked hamstring for most of the day. It didn’t help that they lost stalwart center Nick Mangold to a neck injury during the fourth quarter. The good news is that competitive wild-card chasers like the Steelers, Chargers, and Bills all lost on Sunday, so the Jets are still well positioned to claim a playoff berth. FPI leaves them with an 84.2 percent chance of making the postseason, even if their odds of winning the East have fallen to 10.1 percent. The glass-half-full type would look at Atlanta’s win on Sunday and compliment a defense that still hasn’t earned its stripes, noting how the Falcons held the Titans to a lone touchdown off of a short field after a Matt Ryan interception. Tennessee’s 10 other drives that didn’t start in Atlanta’s red zone produced an average of just 23.7 yards and a total of zero points. Zach Mettenberger basically could only check down, averaging 5.3 yards on his 35 attempts, as the Titans went just 1-for-10 on third and fourth downs. And then, well, the glass-half-empty folks would wonder how Atlanta’s offense mustered only 10 points on a Titans defense that was without two starting defensive backs in Perrish Cox and Michael Griffin. They have a point, too. Atlanta was sloppy on offense throughout this game, and it cost the Falcons points. They could have sealed this game twice in the fourth quarter, but the Falcons came up short on a goal-line possession that included an unsuccessful challenge and a stuffed rushing attempt by Patrick DiMarco before Matt Ryan threw one of his two picks on fourth-and-goal from the 1-yard line. Later, Matt Bryant missed a 47-yarder that would have forced Tennessee to score a touchdown, a concerning trend for the once-automatic kicker, who has now missed three of his past six attempts. The Titans then drove toward field goal range to try to tie the game at 10, only for Mettenberger to give away an easy interception to wrap the contest up. That was his second pick, after an interception inside the 5-yard line at the end of the first half took virtually guaranteed points off the board in a close game. If Atlanta wants to be taken seriously as one of the league’s best teams, it can’t be squeaking by Zach Mettenberger in games like this. Seattle sacked Colin Kaepernick four times on Sunday. I know the Seahawks played the 49ers on Thursday. I’m just telling you this happened. And Arizona, which plays Baltimore tonight, sacked Joe Flacco four times on Sunday. Streeter Lecka/Getty Images It speaks to how good this Panthers defense is that Cam Newton could throw three interceptions on 24 attempts and not ever make the Panthers feel like they were in serious danger of losing. I guess the closest that Philly came during the second half was when Caleb Sturgis pulled a 50-yard field goal, but even that would have just brought the Eagles within two at 21-19 with 12:02 to go. The Carolina offensive line, much maligned by myself and many others before the season, also deserves a lot of credit for what it’s been able to accomplish this year, especially in terms of its run blocking. Philadelphia came into this game second in the league in rush defense DVOA, and even while Carolina’s passing game was struggling, the Panthers ran all over the Eagles. The Panthers carried the ball 33 times for 204 yards, including a 43-yard end-around to Ted Ginn to set up Carolina’s second touchdown of the game. It might be unfair to slip two teams on bye slightly below a team that had to suit up on Sunday, but I don’t think I’m being too aggressive by slotting that team in first … FPI actually has the Patriots way out in front of the rest of the pack. Even though they dropped very slightly after their hard-fought victory over the Jets, the Patriots still lead the league with an 8.4 FPI, placing them comfortably ahead of the third-place Packers (5.2) and the Bengals, who sit in eighth at 3.8. All three teams derive virtually all of their performance per FPI from their offense, producing average-or-worse value from their defense and special teams. I’m not sure that I agree in the case of the Packers defense, but the broader point is probably true: These three teams are going to bludgeon you with their offenses. Other models have these teams sorted slightly differently, but the Patriots are ahead of the other two. FiveThirtyEight has the Patriots no. 1, while Football Outsiders had New England just behind Arizona heading into Week 7. Only the Simple Rating System joins FPI in placing the Patriots as clear favorites between these three teams. In a vacuum, I wouldn’t be too horribly offended if you made a case that the Packers or Bengals deserved to be at the top of this list. In terms of top 25 voting, though, it seems to be tradition that the team that finished last year at no. 1 generally starts the next year at the top of the charts until it’s beaten. If the case between the Patriots, Packers, and Bengals is still too close to call, that seems like enough of a tiebreaker to tip things over New England’s way right now. To be the man, you’ve got to beat the man. And with FPI giving the Patriots a 2.8 percent chance to go 16-0, it may be quite a while before somebody dethrones New England.",2015-10-26T09:40:23+00:00,NFL,Barnwell
42,The Anatomy of Baltimore’s Lost Season,"The most disappointing team in the National Football League this season has to be the Baltimore Ravens. Sure, the Seahawks aren’t living up to expectations. The Chiefs were supposed to be better than this. And the Dolphins were bad enough to fire Joe Philbin before Halloween. They’re all disappointments. The Ravens, though, are two missed Josh Scobee field goals away from starting the season 0-6. The Ravens! This is a team that’s lost more than six games in an entire season only twice during the John Harbaugh era, one that went 10-6 last year before nearly beating the eventual Super Bowl–winning Patriots in Foxborough. They’re perennial contenders, and there was little reason to think they would be anything but that in 2015. And yet, we’re here in Week 7 and the Ravens are 1-5. They’re about to head to Arizona for a game against a pissed-off Cardinals team that has taken great pleasure in stomping dysfunctional, disappointing opponents this season. ESPN’s Football Power Index gives the Ravens a better chance of finishing with the first overall pick in the upcoming draft (3.6 percent) than making the playoffs (2.2 percent). Baltimore’s season is essentially lost. There’s a quirk about how the Ravens have performed that I’ll get into in a bit, but if you want to cast aspersions on one particular facet of this Baltimore team, it’s pretty obviously going to be the defense. Baltimore has allowed 27 points per game, the sixth-worst rate in the league, after allowing a mere 18.9 points per game as the league’s sixth-best scoring defense a year ago. Last year, the Ravens defense made their average opponent look like the 49ers on offense; this year, their average opponent has looked more like the Packers. Yikes. Take a deeper look at how the Ravens have struggled on defense and you’ll gain a greater insight into what’s gone wrong for this team. All of that starts with personnel woes, some of which were clear before the season. It was reasonable to expect that Baltimore’s front seven was going to decline in 2015, thanks to the departure of two meaningful contributors for financial reasons. Longtime star defensive tackle Haloti Ngata went to Detroit for two midround draft picks when the Ravens couldn’t come to terms with the veteran on a restructured deal, leaving Baltimore with a $7.5 million dead-cap charge in 2015. The more crucial loss in hindsight may have been when talented young linebacker Pernell McPhee played so well during the final year of his rookie deal that he priced himself out of Baltimore’s range. After three relatively anonymous seasons, McPhee broke out with 7.5 sacks and a whopping 26 quarterback hits in limited time in 2014, giving the Ravens a devastating interior pass-rusher to go with their edge combination of Elvis Dumervil and Terrell Suggs. The 26-year-old McPhee rode his success to a five-year, $39 million deal with Chicago, where he has four sacks and 10 knockdowns in six games. The Ravens have let players like McPhee go in the past; it was only a couple of years ago that Paul Kruger went through a similar career arc, and the Ravens let him leave for the division-rival Browns without regretting their decision very much at all. They seemed set at outside linebacker with Suggs as an every-down edge rusher on one side and Dumervil platooning with run-thumper Courtney Upshaw on the other. And then, in Week 1, disaster struck. Suggs tore his left Achilles during the fourth quarter of Baltimore’s narrow loss to Denver, three years after tearing his right Achilles during the 2012 offseason. That injury left the Ravens perilously thin on the edge, and things haven’t gotten much better. The loss of Suggs forced Dumervil and Upshaw to go from platoon-mates playing about 50 percent of Baltimore’s defensive snaps to starters playing in the 80 percent range, and, unsurprisingly, they’ve suffered.1 Dumervil is also dealing with a balky groin that’s cost him snaps, leaving the Ravens down to raw rookie Za’Darius Smith and veteran special-teamer Albert McClellan as their outside linebackers on some plays. That’s a far cry from how deep they were at the same spot last season. Look at the pass-rush numbers, interestingly enough, and there’s not much evidence of a drop-off. The Ravens pressured opposing quarterbacks on 25.5 percent of dropbacks and sacked them on 7.4 percent of dropbacks in 2014. This year, they’re pressuring the opposition on 26.1 percent of dropbacks and sacking quarterbacks 7.1 percent of the time. Those are virtually identical figures, suggesting there’s been no drop-off without Suggs in the lineup. Right? Not so fast. The Ravens might be getting to the quarterback as frequently as they were last year, but without Suggs or McPhee, they’re forced to throw extra resources toward the pass rush to generate those figures. Defensive coordinator Dean Pees didn’t need to blitz frequently last year, sending extra pressure on just 28.5 percent of dropbacks. This year, while the Ravens aren’t exactly a Todd Bowles blitz machine, Pees has sent a blitz on 35.6 percent of opposing pass attempts. There’s nothing wrong with blitzing if you can back it up. Bowles’s Jets have one of the league’s deepest, most talented secondaries lurking behind those blitzes, which makes it easy to send pressure on close to half of opposing pass attempts. It would have been reasonable to expect the Ravens to enjoy a similarly talented secondary in 2015. While Baltimore’s hopes of a deep playoff run unraveled at the hands of an injury-riddled secondary last year, this was supposed to be a healthier, deeper unit. Budding no. 1 corner Jimmy Smith was back after missing the second half of 2014 with a Lisfranc injury. Safety Will Hill was onboard for his first full season with the team after being suspended for the first six games of last season. And the Ravens made their typical late-spring foray into free agency to come away with slot cornerback Kyle Arrington from the Patriots. If Pees needed to blitz, he was supposed to have a secondary that would allow him to do so freely. That hasn’t worked out. Smith has struggled badly in his return from what can be a difficult foot injury. Arrington has been beaten for big plays and was losing snaps to Dolphins castoff Will Davis before the latter tore his ACL. Even incumbent Lardarius Webb has looked dreadful for most of the season. Webb missed Sunday’s game against the 49ers with a thigh injury, and the Ravens replaced him with newly acquired Shareece Wright, who had failed to win a job with those same 49ers. Wright was cut by San Francisco on October 10 without playing a single snap this season. He signed with the Ravens on October 12. On October 18, he played 42 snaps against the team that just cut him. If you think this sounds like it didn’t go well, you’re not wrong. Wright had a rough game, and the biggest play came when the Ravens left him one-on-one against their own former player, wideout Torrey Smith:  If “smdh” could be a coverage, this would be it. The Ravens have no deep safety on the play and send five men after Colin Kaepernick without really getting close. They have defenders in intermediate zones, but Wright has to know he can’t get beat deep by Smith, because there’s absolutely no help behind him. That’s exactly what happens,2 even as Wright tries to interrupt the double move with illegal contact. This is asking a lot out of Wright in his first game this season, and truthfully, it was too much. That bomb isn’t an isolated incident: The Ravens have been torched by teams throwing downfield. The NFL defines deep passes as those that travel 16 yards or more in the air. The Ravens have faced 47 of those passes, the fourth-highest total in the league, and on those throws, the Ravens have allowed quarterbacks to rack up a 99.3 QBR, which is also the fourth-worst total in the league. Opposing quarterbacks are 26-of-47 (55.3 percent) for 866 yards with six touchdowns and one interception on those passes. With that combination of frequency and failure, nobody is being hurt more by passes downfield than the Ravens defense. As much as that sounds like a recipe for failure, it’s a survivable problem. Know how I’m sure of that? The 2014 Ravens were just as bad in the same spots. Teams threw 114 deep passes against them, the fifth-highest frequency in the league. And those passes went for a 99.0 QBR, which was dead last. They were the fourth-best team against long passes in 2013, so it’s not a trend, but the Ravens were terrible against downfield passing teams last year and managed to put up a pretty good defense anyway. The biggest difference between this year’s terrible Ravens defense and last year’s above-average Ravens defense, then, isn’t that they can’t get to the quarterback or that they’re giving up big plays. It’s that they can’t get off the field. Last year, the Ravens allowed opposing teams to convert 40.3 percent of their third downs, which was 17th in the league, essentially league-average. This year? That figure is up to 47.8 percent, and only the Jaguars (an even 50 percent!) have been less effective on third down. Nobody’s faced more third downs (92) than the Ravens. It would also help if they could force takeaways again. Last year’s team forced turnovers on 12.0 percent of drives, a relatively middling 21st in the league. That wasn’t impressive, but this year’s defense has forced turnovers on just 5.7 percent of drives, with four takeaways on 70 possessions and none since Week 3, when they strip-sacked Andy Dalton and took their lone fumble recovery of the season to the house. They haven’t exactly been playing Aaron Rodgers and Tom Brady, either: This is a group that’s faced Peyton Manning, Derek Carr, Michael Vick, Josh McCown, and Kaepernick.3 The Ravens should be feasting on takeaways against that group. They are starving. As bad as they’ve been on defense, you can also make a pretty strong case that the Ravens are unlucky to be 1-5. While they required a staggering amount of luck to come back and win that Steelers game, they were within a fourth-quarter possession — or in other cases, even one play — of winning every other game. Steve Smith Sr. memorably dropped a touchdown pass against the Broncos in Week 1. Oakland and Cincinnati drove for game-winning scores in the final three minutes. Cleveland converted three third downs to kick a clinching field goal in overtime. Their five-point loss to the 49ers was probably the furthest the Ravens came from victory, and they finished that game on the San Francisco 35-yard line. The Ravens have seen each of their first six games decided by one score or less. That happens, but it’s rare: Just 13 teams have done that since the AFL-NFL merger in 1970. If you regularly read this space, you know that teams tend to split those close games 50/50. The Ravens have not. Every one of those other teams that started with six one-score games managed to win at least two of those contests. The 12 previous teams went a combined 35-37 in those one-score games. Playing all of those one-score games suggests you’re a pretty average team, which doesn’t leave much hope for the Ravens. There were some success stories from those 12 teams, like the 1999 Vikings, who started 2-4 in six one-score games and then promptly went 8-2 over their final 10 contests to make the playoffs. It’s not crazy to think the Ravens could suddenly find a groove and start winning, especially because, you know, they’re the Ravens. It’s not likely, though. Those 12 teams looked average through their first six games and played average the rest of the way. Their combined record in the final 10 games was 60-60. If the Ravens split the rest of the way, they would finish 6-10. And that will be a wildly disappointing season for a veteran team with perennial expectations of making it deep into the playoffs. It’s hard to take too much issue with what the Ravens do in football operations, given how consistently successful Harbaugh and Ozzie Newsome have been over the past decade. After an unlucky 1-5 start, though, a disappointing defense and some poorly timed injuries appear to have sunk the Ravens in 2015.",2015-10-20T14:49:49+00:00,NFL,Barnwell
43,Your NFL All-Surprise Team,"It’s been a weird season, even by NFL standards. It seems bizarre to think that the Colts and Eagles were among the favorites to win the Super Bowl as recently as six weeks ago. That was a world in which Calvin Johnson was somehow an elite fantasy football receiver. Hell, Devonta Freeman looked plodding three weeks ago, when he had started the year with 43 rushing yards on 22 carries across Atlanta’s first two games. Now, he’s suddenly the second coming of Priest Holmes. Things move fast. So, as we start transitioning from just having a fast start to a full-blown breakout season, let’s run through the surprise packages around the league on the cusp of Week 6. There are new fantasy football juggernauts, useful players finally breaking through into stardom, and even an ancient mystic from the late ’90s playing on one arm. The All-Surprise Team starts, though, with its most obvious selection: QB: Andy Dalton, Bengals I’ve written about Dalton and the Bengals each of the past two Mondays, so I won’t go too deep into breathless Dalton coverage here. But we’re five weeks into the season and Dalton has posted an 83.7 QBR. That’s the second-best figure in the league behind Ben Roethlisberger. It’s better than Aaron Rodgers (81.4), Tom Brady (71.6), or Andrew Luck (a league-low 30.9). He is third in the league in passer rating and second in yards per attempt. Andy Dalton — Andy Dalton!! — is a monster. This brings up an interesting question. Let’s say Dalton stays at this level all season and is a borderline MVP candidate as the Bengals go, say, 12-4. Would it be fair to remain as skeptical of him in the playoffs as most have been in years past? If he’s not the same old Dalton on the same old Bengals during the regular season, it would be wrong to assume that he would have the same problems in the playoffs, no? QB: Tyrod Taylor, Bills Taylor is the argument for why the league would be able to find quarterbacks if it expanded to 40 teams and why organizations in desperate need of a quarterback should target players with unique, high-variance skill sets. Can you imagine this Bills offense with Matt Cassel at quarterback? Taylor is still a reasonably limited quarterback, and the scheme around him is really conservative, but he’s functional enough as a passer to keep from throwing away games and a good enough runner to make plays when the Bills desperately need them, as they did in Tennessee last week. If Taylor keeps it up, he is quietly one of the more valuable assets in football, given that he is in Year 1 of what amounts to a three-year, $3.4 million contract. The biggest concern might be injuries, given that Taylor is an inexperienced quarterback with run tendencies, and is currently questionable this week with a sprained MCL. RB: Dion Lewis, Patriots The running backs on this team keep Freeman1 off the list, which is pretty remarkable. Lewis spent most of 2014 out of football, having been cut by the Browns and Colts, the teams that each invested a first-round pick in Trent Richardson. Lewis beat out Travaris Cadet and James White in the competition to replace Shane Vereen and has basically turned into the supercharged version of the departed receiving back. Lewis is on pace to run for 720 yards and catch 92 passes for 952 yards, which would dwarf Vereen’s 2014 totals (391 rushing yards, 52 catches, 447 receiving yards). RB: Chris Johnson, Cardinals Of course, this is what the Cardinals do. General manager Steve Keim signs a washed-up veteran with a big name and injury issues in the middle of August for close to the league minimum, and when the Cardinals need him to step up, he suddenly becomes one of the better players at his position. Nobody was willing to offer Johnson any sort of guaranteed money throughout the offseason, but here we are in October, and he looks more like the guy who ran for 2,000 yards in 2009 than he has since, well, 2009. Johnson is averaging 5.1 yards per carry without the sort of 80-yard monster run that would have propped up his figures in years past. The last time he did that over a five-week stretch as a primary back was in 2012. It would be tough to expect him to keep this up, but then again, how likely was it that we would see the old Chris Johnson back for any stretch of time when he signed in August? WR: James Jones, Packers The Giants might very well be 5-0 if they had simply held on to James Jones and let go of Preston Parker, who dropped a handful of passes during Big Blue’s 0-2 start before being released. Jones is probably not going to keep averaging 20.7 yards per catch like he is prime DeSean Jackson. And sure, it’s fair to say that virtually all of this is happening because he’s playing alongside Aaron Rodgers. But remember how it looked like there was a huge hole in the Packers lineup when Jordy Nelson went down with a torn ACL? The Packers have barely missed a beat. WR: Travis Benjamin, Browns
TE: Gary Barnidge, Browns Let’s take these two together. Nobody in football has a weirder depth chart than the Browns. The two guys they nominally signed to play as their starting wide receivers on the outside, Brian Hartline and Dwayne Bowe, have combined for 20 targets over five games. Their star wideout instead is Benjamin, an undersize downfield threat who has finally started catching passes. After catching an impossibly low 43.2 percent of his targets through his first three seasons, Benjamin has caught 22 of his 38 targets this year, a 57.9 percent clip. It could very well be the product of a small sample, but that sort of leap in catch rate is the difference between a speed merchant who bounces around practice squads and one who makes $9 million per year. And Benjamin might not even be the biggest surprise. Barnidge, a promising receiving prospect all the way back in 2010, has more receiving yards in the first five games (374) than he had in his previous five years combined (361). He’s gotten some help from playing the Raiders, who are abysmal against tight ends, and he’s not going to catch 18-yard Hail Marys from Josh McCown every week, like he did against Baltimore in Week 5. But Barnidge has shown enough to serve as a believable red zone threat. All he needs to do is don an elbow brace to turn into a Eifertian monster. OL: New York Giants This one is a group award, because nobody expected this out of the Giants. This was a unit that lost its best left tackle option, William Beatty, to a torn pec in May. Beatty will be back in a few weeks, and his return may make this one of the best offensive lines in football, given that he’ll take over for the unit’s weakest link, right tackle Marshall Newhouse. It’s unclear whether Tom Coughlin will move first-round pick Ereck Flowers back to right tackle, where he was expected to play this season before the Beatty injury, or leave alone the team’s left tackle of the future while slotting Beatty in on the right side. Flowers hasn’t been perfect, but he’s been far better early than anyone could have hoped for from a guy who was a long-term project coming out of Miami. The real strength of this line has been on the interior. Guard was an enormous problem for the Giants last year, but the combination of Justin Pugh and Geoff Schwartz has been among the best in football. Pugh was sorely overmatched at tackle — he was a disaster during last year’s ugly loss to the Eagles in Philadelphia, a trip the Giants will repeat this weekend — but the former first-rounder has looked like a natural at guard. Schwartz, who missed virtually all of last year with myriad injuries, has looked like the guy who excelled with the Chiefs in 2013. And second-year center Weston Richburg has quietly taken a big step forward: 4th qtr game on the line pic.twitter.com/6G1b04zHeP — OL Watchdog (@OLineScout) October 13, 2015  DE: Kerry Wynn, Giants Let’s start the defense with the other Giants player on this list. The Giants are second in run defense DVOA, and Wynn is one of the biggest reasons. The undrafted free agent played only 186 defensive snaps last season, but he’s living in the backfield after picking up many of the absent Jason Pierre-Paul’s snaps. The only defensive end with more than Wynn’s 16 tackles against the run is Calais Campbell. Wynn is nowhere near Campbell as a player, but finding an above-average run defender for $510,000 is a feather in GM Jerry Reese’s cap. Bill Barnwell's Week 6 PicksHome team in CAPS. All lines from VegasInsider.com. I took the Saints last night.    Broncos (-4) over BROWNS Bengals (-3) over BILLS Chiefs (+3.5) over VIKINGS JAGUARS (-1) over Texans Bears (+3) over LIONS Washington (+6.5) over JETS STEELERS (+3.5) over Cardinals TITANS (-1.5) over Dolphins Panthers (+7) over SEAHAWKS Chargers (+10.5) over PACKERS Ravens (-2) over 49ERS COLTS (+9) over Patriots EAGLES (-4.5) over Giants     This Week: 1-0 Last Week: 6-7-1 This Season: 43-32-3 (.571) DE: Carlos Dunlap, Bengals It’s not that Dunlap has been a bad player in the past, but the Bengals have perennially been waiting for the Florida product to turn into the superstar his athleticism has seemed to suggest he would become. He’s flashed moments of brilliance as a pro, but even after getting a large contract extension and moving into the starting lineup in 2013, Dunlap’s been too inconsistent of a player. That’s finally changed; after averaging seven sacks a year through his first five seasons, Dunlap already has five sacks and a league-high 14 quarterback knockdowns through five games. It’s another piece of evidence suggesting that quarterback hits are a good future indicator of sack production, given that Dunlap was second in the league with 28 knockdowns last season. DT: David Parry, Colts It’s hard to understand the bizarro-Colts, whose strength in 2015 is … run defense? They’re 16th in pass offense DVOA and 24th running the football. They’re 25th in DVOA against the pass, but after years of famously struggling to stop opposing rushing games, they’re 12th in rush defense DVOA. Teams are averaging just 3.8 yards per carry against the Colts, and part of that has been the work of rookies like Parry and Henry Anderson up front. They’ll be tested by Indy’s nightmare this week, as LeGarrette Blount and the Patriots come to town. LB: Derrick Morgan, Titans Alongside Dunlap in the perennial-breakout club, Morgan re-signed with the Titans this season and has been a critical component of their pass defense, which is third in DVOA. Morgan has 4.5 sacks through four games, which is heady territory for a guy who hasn’t topped 6.5 sacks in a season. He’s getting help from Brian Orakpo, who has only one sack but has managed to draw some attention away from Morgan. Unlike Dunlap, though, Morgan has only six quarterback hits, which suggests he hasn’t been quite the force that his sack total might indicate. LB: Aaron Lynch, 49ers The flip side of that argument is Lynch, who has been a monster without a ridiculous sack total. Lynch has three sacks, but he’s managed to knock down opposing passers 10 times. The other guys in the 10-hit club make for pretty impressive company: Dunlap, DeMarcus Ware, J.J. Watt, Clay Matthews, and Everson Griffen. Lynch was one of the breakout pass-rushers Robert Mays and I agreed upon this summer, and he looks to be a building block for the 49ers defense. LB: Kevin Minter, Cardinals This was a make-or-break year for Minter, a 2013 second-rounder who had struggled to get on the field during his first two seasons. Thrust into a starting role by the retirement of Larry Foote, now Minter’s inside linebackers coach, the LSU product has been excellent against the run and better than expected as a pass defender. It would have been reasonable to assume the Cardinals would use Sean Weatherspoon as a coverage linebacker and take Minter out for one of their many defensive backs in their sub-packages, but Weatherspoon has barely played and was a healthy scratch last week, while Minter has suited up for 88.9 percent of Arizona’s snaps. LB: Nate Stupar, Falcons While he was floored by Mark Ingram on a touchdown run last night, Stupar has been quietly effective as a backup linebacker for the Falcons in Dan Quinn’s new defense. He’s not much more than a rotation piece, but given that he was almost exclusively a special-teamer before seeing a few defensive snaps last season, turning Stupar into viable depth is promising for a team that has had massive injury issues in recent seasons.2 CB: Ronald Darby, Bills An absolute disaster during the preseason, Darby showed up in Week 1 against the Colts as a competent cornerback and hasn’t really looked back. He struggled against the Patriots, but that’s also to be expected, given that it’s the Patriots. With teams terrified of Stephon Gilmore on one side of the field, Darby sees plenty of action, and he’s managed to hold his own during what has been a very promising rookie campaign. CB: Kenneth Acker, 49ers Like Darby, Acker had his ugly day in Week 2, when Antonio Brown basically used him as the base for a Weisian highlight reel. Outside of that disastrous performance, though, Acker’s held up nicely as what basically amounts to a rookie cornerback, given that the 2014 sixth-rounder missed his entire rookie season with a foot injury. Acker’s the sort of tall, long-armed cornerback that NFL teams are drooling over these days; if he continues to improve in coverage, his ability to challenge opposing wideouts at the line of scrimmage and chip in as a willing run defender could make him a very valuable asset. S: Walter Thurmond, Eagles Chip Kelly’s offseason moves haven’t exactly impressed. The one move that’s been an unqualified success, though, has been signing Thurmond and moving him from cornerback to safety. The former Seahawks starter has taken comfortably to his positional switch, with him and Malcolm Jenkins giving the Eagles an above-average pair of starters at a position that’s been their bugaboo since Brian Dawkins left after 2008. Thurmond already has three picks and has been comfortable with the physical aspects of the position; if he can stay healthy, the Eagles will need to start thinking about locking up the impending free agent with an extension. And then trading him a year later, because, you know, Chip. S: Charles Woodson, Raiders Let’s finish with the legend. Woodson isn’t even supposed to be playing right now. Forget that he’s 39 years old and that the only other defensive back in league history to start five games during his age-39 season is Darrell Green. Woodson dislocated his shoulder in Week 1. Honestly, if I had dislocated my shoulder five weeks ago, I wouldn’t be typing this column right now, let alone playing football. And Woodson hasn’t just played. He has stood out. The future Hall of Famer has picked off four passes in those ensuing four games, including a pair of interceptions of Peyton Manning last week. It’s absurd. The Raiders are basically keeping a leaky defense afloat by playing excellent in the red zone, and Woodson’s playmaking ability there has been a big reason they’ve looked competent. This is all from a dude who is nice enough to keep playing so long that he makes sportswriters feel like they aren’t that old. What a great man.",2015-10-16T14:21:12+00:00,NFL,Barnwell
44,Taking the NFL’s Statistical Temperature,"ESPN tracks a staggering variety of statistics for the NFL’s 32 teams. Some of them are wildly useful, like figuring out which teams do the best job of exceeding expectations given the down and distances they face on offense and defense. Others, well, they aren’t quite as compelling. I don’t know that I ever want to split a team’s performance by whether they win the opening coin toss or not, but with the help of TruMedia and ESPN Stats & Information, I can tell you that’s possible. Sometimes, it’s fun to run through some of those categories and splits to see how teams are performing and where they’re excelling. It’s still early in the season, but with everyone having played at least four games, we can get some semblance of insight into what aspects of each team’s performance are different from our expectations heading into the season. Let’s run through some notable categories and see who stands out at the top and bottom of the charts: I always like looking at what a team does on first-and-10 while the game is within 14 points, because it’s the simplest measure of its performance in a vacuum. Much of what a team does in terms of play calling boils down to situations and game context. On first-and-10 in relatively close games, though, the real you comes out on offense. Let’s start with the run/pass splits. Here are the teams that get the most and least pass-happy on first-and-10 when they’re neither trailing nor leading by more than 14 points: Start with the team at the bottom of that pass-happy list. The Seahawks don’t belong there, right? They’re running the ball just 40.4 percent of the time on your typical first-and-10 situations; from 2012 to 2014, they ran the ball 54.2 percent of the time in those same spots, the sixth-highest rate in the league. It tells you just what little confidence Darrell Bevell has in his offensive line to create holes and pick up steady chunks of yardage. The same is probably true in Miami, where the Dolphins are seemingly terrified of running the football. Even last year, as a relatively pass-happy offense, they still ran the ball on 43.9 percent of their first downs, which was third in the league. They’re down to 28.8 percent this year, having totally given up on their running game while leaving teams to prey on Ryan Tannehill’s short passing game. Tannehill has posted a 29.1 QBR on first down this year, 33rd among the league’s 35 qualifying quarterbacks. Only Jay Cutler and Andrew Luck have been worse. The teams running the football a ton make more sense. They split into two groups. There are the teams that run the ball out of the fear that their starting quarterback is going to throw an interception every time he touches the football, which includes the Bears, Bucs, 49ers, and sixth-place Washington. Then there’s the freak-of-nature running back division, which includes the Vikings and Rams. Who is actually getting the most out of those first-down plays, though? Here’s the first-down performance on these plays as ranked by ESPN’s version of success rate, which measures the frequency with which a team exceeds the historical expected points for a down-and-distance situation. These teams are the best and worst on offense on first-and-10 when the game is within 14 points: Well, isn’t that surprising? The Seahawks are throwing the ball more than ever on first down, but they’re getting more out of it than anybody else in football. Seattle doesn’t have a ton of big plays on first down this season, with the one notable exception the 69-yard Thomas Rawls scamper against Cincinnati on Sunday, but they’ve been great at getting steady chunks of yardage. The Lions are also a surprise entrant onto this list, but Matthew Stafford has been much better on first down (10th in QBR) than second down (18th) and third down (31st). The flip side sees some of the league’s more conservative teams delivering subpar first-down performance. The Vikings and Bears just showed up on the run-heavy list above, and given how inefficient running can be relative to passing, they were likely to show up here. I’m surprised the more functionally useful offense in Carolina profiles as the league’s worst first-and-10 attack through its Week 5 bye. One way the Panthers have managed to keep their heads above water while starting 4-0, of course, is by playing dominant defense. Switch sides to consider the success metric from the defensive side of the ball, and the Panthers are football’s second-best unit on first-and-10 when the game is within 14 points: The Broncos have almost unquestionably been the best defense in football, and DeMarcus Ware spent most of the year as the league’s top pass-rusher before a back injury that should sideline him for a few weeks. Denver’s defense has generated nearly twice as many expected points on first down with the score within 14 (23.8 points) as the second-ranked Panthers (12.9 points). The other big surprise in the top five for best defenses is Oakland, where the Raiders have quietly pieced together a deep front seven. The addition of former Cardinals nose tackle Dan Williams to clog up the interior has helped. You’ll note that the Titans have one of the worst first-down defenses in football. How have they managed to keep afloat despite those first-down issues? Why, they get off the field all the time on third down. Here are which teams have managed to pull that off this year: I have to admit I wasn’t ready to see the Titans and especially the Texans as among the league’s top third-down defenses, but here we are. Houston’s also playing at one of the league’s quickest paces despite alternating between Ryan Mallett and Brian Hoyer at quarterback, so I’m not really sure what to make of the Texans sometimes. Opposing field goal kickers are also a league-low 6-for-11 (54.5 percent) against the Texans, while the Titans haven’t had a field goal attempted against them this year, which is weird. Quietly lurking in fifth is an impressive Washington defense whose only real blemish was giving up 32 points to the Giants in Week 3. Washington slowed down the Falcons this week, holding Atlanta’s offense to 19 points before Kirk Cousins’s pick-six in overtime. Success on third down is not an AFC South thing, as evidenced by the poor Jaguars, who are allowing teams to convert on an unacceptable 50 percent of their third-down tries. That’s downright demoralizing, especially given that the Jags badly want to give their young offense as many meaningful reps as possible this early in the campaign. The Ravens and their rapidly weakening secondary could also use more stops as the season goes along. On offense, Joe Flacco & Co. haven’t given the defense much help. They’re converting just 33.8 percent of their third-down attempts, which is only good enough for the eighth-worst spot in the league. Here are the best and worst third-down attacks: If you’re wondering why the Browns have been a lot better on offense than anybody expected, well, here’s your answer. Cleveland may be down to a receiver combination of Gary Barnidge and Taylor Gabriel on some key third downs, but both Josh McCown and Johnny Manziel have had little trouble picking them up for steady conversion rates. The teams that can’t do much on third down have one obvious flaw in common: They can’t and don’t throw downfield. That’s been true of Sam Bradford for a very long time, and the Rams and Chiefs are getting further confirmation that Nick Foles and Alex Smith aren’t exactly downfield passing demons. The same is true of 2015 Peyton Manning. The Raiders snuck in with the fifth-best third-down conversion rate this season. That’s not necessarily unsustainable, but what was incredibly unlikely to recur was last year’s dominant first-place red zone offense, especially with a unit that wasn’t particularly good across the other 80 yards of the field. So, have the Raiders continued their success near pay dirt? The Raiders aren’t in the top five, but they are indeed close, as they’ve finished eighth (5.29 points per drive) on the close-range stuff. The Steelers demonstrated their red zone superiority on Monday by scoring a game-winning touchdown on that terrifying Le’Veon Bell Wildcat run with just seconds to go, but don’t expect them to average nearly a touchdown per trip from here on out. The other side of the chart explains a lot. The Dolphins aren’t moving the ball on first downs, and they aren’t converting on third downs, which is a great way for your offense to never, ever score. The Seahawks badly miss Marshawn Lynch as a power back inside the 5-yard line. Let’s finish up by looking at the red zone defenses. Who’s managed to hold up inside their own 20-yard line? The Jets are your clear winner here. I wrote about the unsustainability of how good they had been in the red zone several weeks ago, but they built enough of an early advantage to still be leading the league. The other four defenses are the ones you might expect. And, yes, this explains why and how the Texans are struggling on defense despite having one of the best third-down defenses in football. We’ll check back on these numbers as the season goes along to see if there’s any sort of consistency, or if there is a new random bunch of leaders atop — or abottom — the quirky statistical charts.",2015-10-13T11:27:46+00:00,NFL,Barnwell
45,The NFL Quarter-Season Awards,"The vast majority of the NFL’s 32 teams have made it through four games, which means it’s time to begin one of my favorite annual recurring features. It’s fun to hand out awards during each quarter of the NFL season, but it also produces some perspective as we get lost during the 17-week season. This time last year, we hadn’t even seen Odell Beckham Jr. play, and Aaron Donald was playing only a handful of St. Louis’s snaps. Kelvin Benjamin and Kyle Fuller, respectively, were the Offensive and Defensive Rookies of the Year. Philip Rivers was the leading MVP candidate, with Aaron Rodgers putting up great numbers for a 3-2 Packers team. Things change, but I’m not bringing those players up to point out how they were obviously usurped. Their performances in the first quarter of the season weren’t any less great, but we forgot about them because other players emerged. Benjamin can’t build on his 2014 while he’s out with a torn ACL, obviously, while Fuller has been one of the few bright spots in a struggling Bears defense. Rivers, who faded badly as the season went along, leads the league in passing yards behind a decaying offensive line and may make a run at completing 70 percent of his attempts. Rodgers and the Packers, on the other hand … they’re not 3-2 this time around. Let’s run through this week’s picks and nominate some award winners for the first quarter of the season, for trophies both real and imagined. As always, these lines are the consensus lines posted by VegasInsider.com, and the home team is in CAPS. I started the week off with a loss by taking Texans -4.5 last night, and actually, let’s get started there … Worst Coaching Tree Award: Bill Belichick Are we at the point where we have to start wondering how long the Bill O’Brien era runs in Houston? Twitter spent the first half of the Colts-Texans game wondering whether O’Brien’s team had quit on him and the second half watching it make jaw-dropping mistakes while Ryan Mallett pouted on the sideline. Even O’Brien couldn’t stop himself from shouting “Why would you do that?” as star wideout DeAndre Hopkins chucked the ball at a Colts defender during the team’s final possession. O’Brien established the tenor for the 2015 season by benching Brian Hoyer for Mallett after three quarters against the Chiefs in Week 1, subsequently giving Mallett the job by suggesting he had given the team a “spark.” When you get two months of training camp to evaluate a pair of quarterbacks and go back on your decision after three quarters, it’s a sign you’re basically just guessing and hoping somebody wins the job. Now, O’Brien will surely have to go back to Hoyer, who outplayed Mallett at the end of a blowout loss to the Falcons last week and then came in for a momentarily injured Mallett on Thursday night, promptly leading a touchdown drive that led O’Brien to leave Mallett on the bench. As Mallett fumed, Hoyer sparked the Houston offense with (mostly) checkdowns, mixing in a bizarre Hail Mary that the Colts appeared to quit on in midair. Hoyer exhibited the hot hand for most of the second half, only to miss on the two most important throws of the game: First, a would-be touchdown pass to an open Hopkins that would have brought Houston within three, and then on the absurd interception that ended up as the offense’s final play. O’Brien has flip-flopped so frequently this season that it invokes one of the league’s cardinal sins: When you have two starting quarterbacks, you have zero starting quarterbacks. It’s too early to write off O’Brien’s future as the Houston coach, and if the Texans do make changes this offseason, it would likely involve general manager Rick Smith, not their head coach. But this is getting to be another depressing branch on the Belichick Tree. Here is what Belichick’s coordinators have done as NFL head coaches: And that’s without including Charlie Weis, who went 41-49 while flaming out at Notre Dame and Kansas. (To be fair, it doesn’t include Saban’s wildly successful run at Alabama, or O’Brien’s credible performance at Penn State.) I don’t know why all of these coaches haven’t panned out. But Belichick’s disciples are working on their 17th combined season as an NFL head coach and they’ve managed to make the playoffs exactly once: in 2006, when Mangini’s Jets were blown out 37-16 by … the Patriots. Florida Division Champs: Winner of this matchup In the shadow NFL where the three Florida teams have been lumped together for both their safety and the safety of the rest of the league, this is a fight for first place. There is currently a three-way tie for Florida, with the Bucs, Jags, and Fins all off to 1-3 starts; with the Dolphins licking their London wounds on a bye this weekend, the winner of this matchup will take over first place in the race to crown a Sunshine State champion. This is probably the darkest season in Florida’s run as a three-team state; since the Jaguars entered the league in 1995, the division has been won by a team with seven wins or more every year besides 2011, when the Dolphins took it at 6-10. Each of the three Florida teams fired its coach that season, with two making midseason firings. Marketer of the Year: Chip Kelly We’re four games into the Chip Kelly: Personnel Maven experiment, and the early returns are brutally bad. Kiko Alonso is hurt. Byron Maxwell was playing like a below-average starter before he got hurt. The offensive line is a mess. DeMarco Murray is averaging 1.6 yards per carry, is already injured, and is still complaining about not getting the ball frequently enough for his liking. And Sam Bradford has posted a 32.3 QBR, which is 32nd among 35 qualifying quarterbacks. Ryan Mallett, who is in 27th place with a 51.4 QBR, is closer to Tony Romo (69.9) in ninth than he is to Bradford. And you know what? I’m still holding out hope. I wrote about Bradford’s seeming mental block about throwing deep last summer, saw the Rams flourish downfield without him around, and saw Bradford basically avoid throwing downfield like the plague through the first three games. All of that changed last week when Bradford threw eight passes that traveled 20 or more yards in the air against Washington after throwing just five such passes over the first three weeks combined. He was 0-for-5 on those passes the first three weeks, but against Washington he was 4-of-8 for 176 yards with two touchdowns on those throws. It’s the first time he’s shown any propensity to throw deep in years, but I’m intrigued! Only Chip could make that happen. Tom Szczerbowski/Getty Images Possibly Good Team I’m Afraid To Talk About Award: The Giants?!? I hesitate to say this, but the 2-2 Giants could very easily be a 4-0 team right now. It took an overwhelmingly unlikely collapse against the Cowboys in Week 1 and one big play from Julio Jones during the home opener in Week 2 to send the Giants to brutal defeats. They’ve followed those losses with comfortable victories over Washington and Buffalo, the latter coming on the road. And their schedule isn’t very tough: Their next five games come against the 49ers, Eagles, the Romo-less Cowboys, Saints, and Buccaneers. With the rest of the NFC East floundering, the Giants could take a commanding lead in the division by the time the Eagles make up their minds about Bradford and the Cowboys get Romo back from short-term injured reserve. In fact, they probably should have already. I really, really hesitate to say how they’re doing it, because it’s going to summon an evil, vengeful god: A team with Eli Manning is somehow dominating the turnover battle. The Giants have turned the ball over just twice on offense, with Manning throwing just a single pick in his first 143 pass attempts, albeit a brutal red zone interception against the Bills last week in a situation where he should not have been taking even the tiniest of risks. And they’ve forced eight takeaways in four games without Jason Pierre-Paul. Out of fear of unearthing an ancient four-interception game from Eli, I can say no more. Mind Control Award: Alex Smith No, Alex Smith isn’t controlling our minds into checking down to day-old bread because it’s better than going hungry. We’re the ones mind-controlled into thinking that Alex Smith is a hindrance, that he’s going to prevent the Chiefs from ever seriously contending for a Super Bowl. I don’t think the evidence is there. It’s worth remembering that the 49ers very nearly made the Super Bowl in 2011 with Smith at the helm, losing in the NFC Championship Game to the Giants almost exclusively because Kyle Williams mishandled two punts. Smith was admittedly bad in that game, but he was fantastic against the Saints in the previous round, throwing for 299 yards and three scores while winning a shootout against Drew Brees. And in the one playoff game he’s started as a Chiefs quarterback, Smith threw for 378 yards and four touchdowns against the Colts despite losing his top two running backs and one of his starting wide receivers during the game. We live in a league where Joe Flacco and Eli Manning have won Super Bowls. Alex Smith isn’t going to drag the Chiefs into January, but he’s not holding them back, either. (That might be you, 30th-ranked defense.) Genuine Pity Award: Jimmy Wilson It’s been a rough couple of weeks for Wilson, the former Dolphins safety who has been forced into the San Diego starting lineup by an injury to Jahleel Addae. You probably saw the most notable moment of his past two weeks, when Adrian Peterson stiff-armed him into the Minneapolis turf. That was bad. But it’s not the only time Wilson’s popped up on tape in recent weeks. Earlier that game, Peterson met Wilson in the hole and basically just accelerated past him like it was a high school game:  That’s not crazy because, you know, it’s Adrian Peterson. It’s one thing to have a bad day against one of the most physically dominant players in the league. It’s another to make a nemesis of Gary Barnidge:  The Browns isolated Barnidge on Wilson for the two most important plays of their final possession; first, while Wilson actually did a decent job in coverage, Barnidge caught a Josh McCown lob over Wilson to set up first-and-goal from the 1-yard line:  Wilson excitedly gave the no-catch signal after this was initially ruled an incompletion on the field; there was no sign of whether he dejectedly put up a catch symbol after it was overturned on review. Two plays later, the Browns put Barnidge in motion and he beat Wilson to the edge for a score that would set up the game-tying two-point conversion:  The Steelers are in town this week. I’m not saying that Antonio Brown is going to stomp on Jimmy Wilson like he was Spencer Lanning. If it happens, just know that you should already be feeling a little bit of remorse when you watch the Vine 100 times in a row. We’re getting to the point where Wilson is being bullied. Defensive Rookie of the Year: Ronald Darby OK, let’s start with the real awards. Darby was an absolute disaster in the preseason, but he has managed to hold up and play above-average football over the first four weeks. He’s getting a ton of attention because teams are afraid to throw at Stephon Gilmore, and while Darby has been beaten a couple of times, he is performing enough to justify keeping his job when Leodis McKelvin comes back. Darby has knocked away a league-high 11 passes; nobody else has more than eight. There is plenty of time for other candidates to emerge, and it wouldn’t be a surprise to see an Aaron Donald–esque contender step up with more playing time. Hau’oli Kikaha already has three sacks in four games for the Saints, playing nearly 85 percent of the team’s snaps. Henry Anderson has been one of the few bright spots up front for the Colts, with five tackles for loss, while Leonard Williams is tied for eighth in the league with six quarterback knockdowns. And Vic Beasley’s been making plays for a surprisingly undefeated Falcons team. The race is on. Offensive Rookie of the Year: Tyler Lockett This one will probably be slightly more controversial, because there are all kinds of compelling options on the other side of football. Marcus Mariota has been smooth and unflappable from the drop, throwing eight touchdowns against two picks over his first three starts. Amari Cooper immediately elevated Oakland’s passing attack, and he’s on pace for a 96-1,356-8 rookie season, which would be one of the best debut campaigns in league history. Todd Gurley flashed his brilliance last week, and even Karlos Williams has been impressive. All kinds of choices. In terms of the most important rookie through the first month, though, it’s not out of the question to choose Lockett. He is just the ninth player since the AFL-NFL merger in 1970 to score on a punt return and a kick return during the first four games of the season, and the first rookie to pull that off since Tony Green in 1978. He’s been a much-needed source of points for a struggling Seattle offense. Teams are already beginning to realize they need to punt the ball away from him. I don’t think Lockett will be able to keep this up, so I would expect him to cede the trophy to Mariota or Cooper by the time the season ends, but he’s off to a remarkable start. Getty Images Executive of the Year/Coach of the Year: Bill Belichick Belichick’s a three-time Coach of the Year winner for his work with the Patriots, but he’s never won Executive of the Year; Scott Pioli picked up the award (as handed out by various institutions) in as many as five seasons during his time with the Patriots and Chiefs, and could very well be a favorite to pick up his sixth such honor with the Falcons starting 4-0. And it’s also fair to say that Belichick the executive benefits from having Belichick the coach around to implement a game plan built around his players’ strengths while simultaneously targeting players who he knows he’ll be able to fit into the lineup. And then look at what’s happening with this dominant Patriots team. They’re starting two rookies along the offensive line most weeks. Their top running back was out of football last year and their top wide receiver is a converted college quarterback who didn’t attract a sniff in free agency. Their other running back and their star linebacker came out of one of Belichick’s many draft-day trades. They lost their top three cornerbacks, one of whom is a future Hall of Famer, and haven’t skipped a beat. Nobody wants to reward Belichick,1 but if the Patriots keep winning, doesn’t he have to win at least one of these awards? Comeback Player of the Year: Carson Palmer This could go a lot of different ways. I’m sure some people will make a case for Adrian Peterson, although it’s going to be pretty distasteful if those people ever have to explain what Peterson’s actually coming back from. Eric Berry’s return from Hodgkin’s lymphoma has been nothing short of remarkable, although it’s fair to say he’s still not 100 percent. And NaVorro Bowman has been an anchor for the 49ers as he returns from the catastrophic knee injury he suffered during the 2013 NFC Championship Game. So far, though, Palmer deserves the nod. Given that the 35-year-old wasn’t exactly in pristine condition before tearing his ACL for the second time in November 2014, it wouldn’t have been a surprise if Palmer hadn’t been able to make it back for the beginning of the 2015 season, or if he had struggled mightily when he did return. Instead, not only has Palmer lived up to his level of play from last season, he’s arguably playing better than he ever has as a pro. He is sixth in QBR through four games, and if I was picking an NFC Pro Bowl team today, Palmer would be on the squad alongside Aaron Rodgers and Cam Newton, with Eli Manning, Russell Wilson, and Matt Ryan trailing behind. Farewell Player of the Year: Steve Smith Sr. If there’s a Comeback Player of the Year, there should really be a Farewell Player of the Year, too. And if there was ever a reason to suddenly institute that award for a player who was giving the most wonderful performance as he leaves the game, well, that’s Steve Smith. He’s single-handedly been keeping a struggling Ravens passing game afloat. Jerry Rice is the only receiver 36 years or older who has posted more than one 15-target game in a season (going back through 1998, at least), and Smith posted two during the first three weeks. He has been breaking tackles and shoving defenders to the ground to convert much-needed third and fourth downs, but even that’s not enough. He’s doing even more Steve Smith things, like trash-talking Bengals defenders on the bench while referring to them only by their numbers, like he can’t be bothered to learn their names. (He can’t — and indeed shan’t — be bothered.) And now, he’s broken four bones in his back. The Ravens have reportedly ruled him out for this week’s game against the Browns, but I’ll believe that when I see it. Defensive Player of the Year: DeMarcus Ware Yes, so far, over J.J. Watt. Please don’t hurt me, Mr. Watt. Ware’s numbers are competitive despite Watt playing five games to Ware’s four: Watt has been a better run defender, which isn’t a surprise, but Ware has been the most unstoppable pass-rusher in football. The Broncos are getting pressure on 37.0 percent of opposing dropbacks, the second-best rate in the league behind Tennessee (really), and Ware has been the biggest reason that’s occurred. Again, if I had to pick a favorite to win over the entire season, I’d pick Watt, if only because I value my legs. But over the first month, Ware has been a totally reasonable alternative choice. Offensive Player of the Year: Julio Jones I’m treating this as an award for the best offensive player who isn’t a quarterback, and through four games, that’s Mr. Jones. This is where you make a highlight video of ridiculous Julio catches and set it to an awful Counting Crows song. I wrote about how incredible Jones has been last week, so it’s no surprise he promptly was held to his quietest day of the season, with the Falcons limiting him to 55 percent of the offensive snaps during a blowout win over the Texans. If you’re going by the no-QBs rule, you could make a case for Antonio Brown or Rob Gronkowski as challengers to this throne, and I wouldn’t disagree. But Brown has had Le’Veon Bell, at least for two games. That’s at least one other game-changing skill-position player to take the defense’s attention away. Gronk has Julian Edelman. Can you picture how bad this Falcons offense would be without Jones? If they were starting a clearly injured Roddy White and Leonard Hankerson at wide receiver? Bless Devonta Freeman’s heart, but he’s not a star running back. This is a one-man show and it’s been incredible to watch. The only thing holding Jones back going forward is injury. Well, that and blowouts. Most Valuable Player: Aaron Rodgers And that leaves us with the two-man race for league MVP. The numbers, with Rodgers in four games versus Tom Brady in three: The rate statistics are basically a dead heat. Brady’s volume is impressive, given how he’s managed to outproduce Rodgers in yardage despite playing one fewer game. Obviously, they both have ridiculous runs of touchdowns without interceptions. It’s hard to imagine quarterbacks playing any better than Rodgers and Brady have over the first month, and I wouldn’t blame you for picking either guy. The difference, for me, is supporting cast. They each have a fantastic slot receiver, with Edelman in New England and Randall Cobb in Green Bay, but Brady has Gronk. He certainly makes Gronkowski better, but there are plays where Gronkowski is just uncoverable in a way that nobody else in football is uncoverable, in the way that a bear mauling your picnic site is unstoppable. Rodgers, meanwhile, is doing this without Jordy Nelson, the closest thing he has to a Gronkowski. His no. 2 receiver is James Jones, who was cut by the Giants in September. He has made some ridiculous catches this season, but Jones is a guy in a bear suit rummaging around your picnic site. He’s still scary — because why on earth is there a guy in a bear suit foraging for food in your camp? — but he’s not Gronk. Brady would still be a good quarterback without Gronkowski, but we’ve seen over the past few seasons how his ceiling falls precipitously without his star tight end available or even at less than 100 percent, as was the case over the first four games of the 2014 season. Brady can’t be this Tom Brady without Gronk. Rodgers is playing this well without Nelson. For me, that’s enough to open up the tiniest of differences between the two best quarterbacks in football. But let’s check back in a month to see if that’s still the case. THIS WEEK: 0-1

46,How the Stars (and Stripes) Saved Seattle,"It happened again. Three years after the Fail Mary, the Seahawks were bailed out on Monday Night Football by an officiating mistake at the most critical moment of the game. While this call wasn’t as significant a game-decider as the one the replacement officials made against the Packers in 2012, it was an even more egregious mistake. It overshadows a game-saving play by Kam Chancellor, which itself overshadows a gutsy effort from the visiting Lions. First, the blown call. With Calvin Johnson stretching for the end zone, Chancellor managed to time a Charles Tillman–esque punch perfectly and knock the ball out of Megatron’s hands, sending it into the end zone. With a free shot at recovering the fumble, K.J. Wright then chose to bat the ball through the back of the end zone, with the officials awarding the Seahawks a touchback and possession of the ball on the 20-yard line. As you already know, this was a botched call. Wright should have been called for illegal batting — it’s against the rules to intentionally bat a ball in the end zone — which would have given the ball back to the Lions with a new set of downs from the six-inch line. Given that the back judge was perfectly placed to see Wright’s bat, the only logical explanation is that he assumed Wright’s move was unintentional and that the ball was accidentally knocked out of bounds. Wright admitted after the game that he did purposely knock the ball out of play, saying that he wasn’t aware of the illegal batting rule until afterward. Truthfully, I don’t think there’s a ton to say about it. There’s no debate to be had. It’s a blown call at the worst possible time. I’ve seen suggestions that the officials should have been allowed to overturn the call during the subsequent turnover review, but I don’t think that’s a good idea. Judging intent is hard enough to do in real time; deciding whether a bat is intentional on replay would be one of those quasi-judgment calls like pass interference or forward progress, and I don’t think that’s a great thing for officials to judge in slow-motion replay. That would create even more controversial calls. In terms of game impact, it was an enormous swing. ESPN’s Brian Burke, formerly of Advanced Football Analytics, used his win expectancy model to point out just how dramatically Seattle’s fortunes depended upon both Chancellor’s forced fumble and the blown call: The fumble combined with a touchback and change of possession improved Seattle’s chances of winning by 73.8 percentage points. The blown call alone improved Seattle’s chances by 70.2 percentage points. Expressed differently, the decision by the back judge to keep the flag in his pocket was worth 0.70 wins to the Seahawks. To put that in context, consider what ESPN’s Football Power Index said about Tom Brady’s four-game suspension before it was overturned. FPI calculated that the total drop-off between Brady and backup Jimmy Garoppolo would have amounted to 0.78 wins over the first quarter of the season. That’s not per game. That’s the total figure. The officials gifting the Seahawks possession of the football at the end of this game is only a tiny bit less significant than it was for the Patriots to get Brady back for the first four games of 2015. The bad call masks how incredible Chancellor’s forced fumble actually was. It saved the Seahawks from dropping to 1-3 ahead of a trip to Cincinnati, where they’re currently listed as one-point underdogs. A loss there and the Seahawks would have started their season a lowly 1-4. Just nine teams since the AFL-NFL merger in 1970 have started their season 1-4 and made it to the postseason, most recently Tim Tebow’s 2011 Broncos. In this scenario, the Seahawks would likely have been three games behind the Cardinals with 11 games to go; that wouldn’t have been insurmountable, but it would have left Seattle with a mountain to climb to claim the NFC West. Instead, the call pushed Detroit’s season closer to the brink. The Lions have slightly more hope than you might expect for a team that’s 0-4, but their chances are still remarkably slim. FiveThirtyEight projects that Detroit has a 10 percent chance of making the playoffs, with a 3 percent chance of overcoming what is already a four-game deficit behind the Packers in the NFC North. Those figures have fallen fast for the Lions, who FiveThirtyEight said had a 43 percent chance of making the playoffs before the season. You could forgive Lions fans for being upset at the moment, given that they were knocked out of the playoffs by the Cowboys last season after a controversial no-call when a pass interference flag was atypically picked up. It will certainly be a crushing blow to the Detroit players, who showed up in Seattle as 10-point underdogs and played like their season was on the line. Despite missing the two best players from their 2014 defense in Ndamukong Suh (who left for Miami in free agency) and DeAndre Levy (still out with a mysterious hip ailment), the Lions went into Seattle and delivered a performance that would be in line with their best from the 2014 season. Their pass rush had been virtually nonexistent through the first three games of 2015, producing just four sacks and 16 quarterback hits while allowing nearly 28 points per game. Lions defensive coordinator Teryl Austin had his unit getting pressure on just 19.4 percent of dropbacks, the fourth-worst rate in football. Those numbers dramatically improved in Week 4. The Lions pressured Russell Wilson on 48.6 percent of his dropbacks, the fifth-highest rate by any team in a game this season. Ziggy Ansah, who appeared unblockable at times, picked up two sacks to take his season total to four sacks and seven quarterback hits. The only players who have matched or exceeded Ansah in both categories are DeMarcus Ware and J.J. Watt. That’s a pretty impressive neighborhood in which to reside. Of course, while the Lions did play better up front and got more pressure than normal, much of that has to do with the Seahawks offensive line being an absolute disaster this season. About the nicest thing you can say about the unit, stripped of Max Unger and James Carpenter this offseason, is that there is never a wait for a turnstile. They were unable to create anything in the way of running lanes for undrafted rookie Thomas Rawls, who served as the primary running back with Marshawn Lynch out and Fred Jackson injured during the game. Rawls gained just 48 yards on 17 carries, including an eight-carry, 9-yard first half. Instead, the Seahawks were bailed out on offense by their stars. Their running game this year — and truthfully, more than they might care to admit in years past — has been built around Lynch’s rare ability to beat defenders up one-on-one, either bullying them aside or dragging them for extra yardage. And their passing game works because Wilson makes magic happen on seemingly every snap, bailing out the line by making free rushers miss before finding an open receiver for a big gain. That’s what happened on Seattle’s first-half touchdown drive, which saw Wilson spin away from a free Jason Jones coming up the A-gap before running past Ansah, looking upfield, and delivering a pass to Jermaine Kearse for 34 yards as Wilson took an enormous hit from a third Lions defender. On the very next play, with a rare bit of time to throw in the pocket, Wilson fired a perfect strike up the seam to Doug Baldwin for a 24-yard touchdown. It was the offense’s only sign of life for most of the day, and when the Seahawks needed a first down to finish the game, they just had Wilson take a shotgun snap and outrun an unblocked Josh Bynes off the edge before firing a 50-yard pass to Kearse. Detroit’s only touchdown came on one of Wilson’s two fourth-quarter strip-sacks, but the degree of difficulty for what he’s being asked to do in this wildly limited and dysfunctional Seattle offense is enormous. It’s one of the silliest perennial offseason arguments that Wilson is a system quarterback who wins because he plays with Lynch and a great defense. On many nights, Wilson is the system. Seattle is becoming a team that wins only if its transcendent star players outperform the system, and that’s what got the Seahawks over the finish line Monday. It was Wilson on offense, and when a dominant defensive display finally threatened to collapse and allow the Lions to sneak ahead, it was Chancellor’s remarkable forced fumble that saved things. You can understand why John Schneider didn’t want to set a precedent by giving Chancellor a new extension, and it’s too simplistic to link the dramatic improvement in their defense over the past two weeks solely to Chancellor’s return, but they got a special play from a special player when they absolutely needed one. The Seahawks aren’t the deep, versatile unit they were before their myriad superstars moved from rookie contracts to market-value extensions. They’re a top-heavy team with a ton of undrafted free agents on the roster, a team that needs its stars to be on the field and to play well. If Chancellor chooses to hold out again this offseason (or as I semi-jokingly suggested Friday before this all happened, this week), the Seahawks really won’t be able to afford to leave him on the sideline. Seattle certainly has a few superstars, and with the 12s, it has the best home-field advantage in football. The Seahawks just can’t count on a 13th man in black-and-white stripes helping them out on a weekly basis, too.",2015-10-06T10:25:20+00:00,NFL,Barnwell
47,The Worst Plays in NFL History,"You’ve seen Brandon Marshall’s blunder from last weekend by now. Marshall’s bizarre lateral attempt flummoxed even those Jets fans most seasoned in Jetsery. Marshall, to his credit, was honest about his mistake after the game, calling it “probably [the] worst play in NFL history.” I mean, it’s certainly not a good play. After watching it a few times, I think I can figure out what was happening. Marshall was falling down, saw tight end Jeff Cumberland out of the corner of his eye, and made the move to lateral before he could see the defenders trailing him. The problem, of course, is that Marshall was lateraling to a 260-pound tight end 60 yards from the end zone. The upside wasn’t especially high, and the downside … well, you saw the downside. The worst play in history, though? I know Marshall was using hyperbole, but there has to have been an uglier moment in on-field NFL history than a lateral gone wrong. There’s one obvious moment from recent Jets history that stands out, of course. Ask most people about the worst play in NFL history and they will probably bring up the Butt Fumble, which might have single-handedly brought Mark Sanchez’s Jets career to its end:  I’m also going to say this isn’t the worst play in NFL history. Again, nobody is suggesting it was good. But a lot of what makes the Butt Fumble so ridiculous is the context. It was a nationally televised Thanksgiving game that everybody was watching. It involved Sanchez, who was already the subject of some public ridicule, and the Jets, who, well, them too. And it was immediately christened with the perfect name, which makes it easy to recite when we think about the worst thing ever. The play itself is pretty bad, but it’s not like Sanchez made a conscious decision to slide into Brandon Moore’s1 butt. Sanchez was going to slide at the end of a busted play just as Moore was pushed backward; it was a remarkable confluence of particularly awful events, which is fun, but I think we can do better. So, I went on Twitter and asked for your suggestions on this very topic. I had a few ideas of my own, of course, but your memories brought up numerous moments of absolute disaster I’d either forgotten about or never seen before. A lot of suggestions were like “every 49ers play,” which is fine, but not really the answer to this question. This isn’t a quantitative question. If you’re asking about the worst play in NFL history in terms of damaging a franchise’s Super Bowl hopes, the answer is both very recent and very clear: It’s the Russell Wilson interception at the end of last season’s Super Bowl. Football Outsiders estimates it reduced Seattle’s chances of defending its championship from 87.4 percent to 0.4 percent. Obviously, it’s almost impossible to have a larger swing; most teams’ Super Bowl chances don’t get anywhere near 87.4 percent until the game itself, and while a team can blow that sort of advantage, it’s difficult to do it on one play. Indeed, before the interception, the biggest single-play swing was Scott Norwood’s missed field goal in Super Bowl XXV, and even that was only a 45 percent drop. Instead, when we think about the worst play in NFL history, it’s less about the quantitative impact and more about the intent and qualitative aesthetics of what went down. It’s about efforts combining to produce a play of professional football that looks as little like professional football as possible. Futility is important, but farce is even more important. And if it turns a win into a loss, that’s just a bonus. Let’s start with a classic, and one of the more frequently referenced candidates: Miami kicker Garo Yepremian’s attempt to complete a pass after a blocked field goal attempt in Super Bowl VII:  This is our Platonic ideal for the worst play ever. It happened in the Super Bowl. It’s a clearly panicked player who is being forced into attempting something he is clearly not qualified to do. He reacts by exhibiting about the same level of ability as you or me while attempting a pass against angry NFL defenders. And the punishment is swift and stark: Yepremian’s interception is returned for a touchdown. The best part is that this is the only memorable misstep for the NFL’s only undefeated team, the 1972 Dolphins; whenever a member of that team gives a pithy quote about how perfect they were, they should have to answer for Garo’s Gaffe. There is also a beautiful history of quarterbacks making desperately stupid passes. One of my picks was this infinitely gorgeous pass by Blaine Gabbert, who inexplicably responded to a pending sack in the red zone by throwing the ball 6 yards backward and out of bounds. This was nine games into Gabbert’s career, and it was almost definitely the moment when it became clear this wasn’t going well. There’s an even better version of the Gabbert play, though, and it requires us to go back to November 7, 2004, when Aaron Brooks decided to show the Chargers what he could do. Many of you nominated this one, but @btepper24 was first: This is better because it seems fully controlled. Brooks was under some duress, but it wasn’t like he was in the grasp of a defender and tried to just get the ball out. There has to have been at least some part of Brooks that genuinely thought his best idea was to throw the ball backward 10 yards to a receiver, albeit one who turned out to not actually be there. It’s also great because the Vine fades to black without revealing what happened next. Mike McCarthy was this team’s offensive coordinator, so I assume it involved a field goal.2 Sam Metivier recommends a 2014 Week 1 pass attempt from Josh McCown that does a pretty great job of capturing last year’s Bucs in one play: @billbarnwell pic.twitter.com/bx4XmUd2gC — Sam Metivier (@sam_metivier) October 1, 2015 And in the interest of taking a modern star down a peg, as many of you suggested, remember that Brandon Weeden wasn’t always this good:  I love how casual Weeden is about this pick. I understand he is infinitely better than any of us will ever be at quarterback, and that’s fine. And I hate the argument that you have to “earn” the right to try something wacky at quarterback or flip your bat. But my dude isn’t really all that great at completing passes the traditional way, and he’s trying to flip a ball with his wrist nearly from the hashmark to the sideline. It’s actually incredible he was able to get that much on the pass to begin with. Not everything a quarterback does to screw things up has to be a pass. There’s what Jamie Gray called the Sagecopter, when Sage Rosenfels tried to ice a late lead over the Colts by Elwaying his way into a first down and subsequently fumbled the ball away to drive an Indy comeback:  One of the most popular responses was that time Dan Orlovsky simply scrambled his way out of the end zone for a safety. Watch Jared Allen point frantically like the referee isn’t going to realize that Orlovsky has both of his feet out of the end zone:  Or there was that time Philip Rivers was kneeling to set up what would have been a game-winning field goal against the Chiefs on Monday Night Football in 2011 and fumbled the snap away. That was the year Tim Tebow’s Broncos won the division on a tiebreaker at 8-8, so it’s fair to say this was probably the power of Tebow striking when we all least expected:  Kneeldowns are dangerous, but one of the most famous gaffes in league history came when a team simply couldn’t kneel down. The Miracle at the Meadowlands, another crowd favorite, had the Giants up 17-12 with 31 seconds to go on the division rival Eagles, who had no way of stopping the clock. In an era when coaches were loath to run the clock out without executing meaningful plays (send Andy Reid back there), Giants quarterback Joe Pisarcik attempted to execute a handoff3 to running back Larry Csonka, only to nearly fumble the snap before botching the exchange:  The weirdest part of the Miracle at the Meadowlands is that Herm Edwards is the one who recovered the fumble and returned it for a touchdown. As someone who was born in 1984, I can’t fathom Edwards being anything but a coach. It’s like imagining your parents flirting as teenagers. Herm Edwards was always a coach. The Eagles were on the right side of another oft-nominated famous disaster. If there was a team award for worst play in NFL history, it might go to the Packers for their inability to stop the Eagles on fourth-and-26:  It’s pretty incredible that one play simultaneously buttressed the clutch reputations of Andy Reid, Donovan McNabb, and Freddie Mitchell all at the same time. I’m not sure Reid’s current quarterback, Alex Smith, threw passes a combined 26 yards downfield on Monday night. The flip side, of course, is that the more recent vintages of the Eagles seem to feature heavily as worst-play candidates. There was that time, as @SteveTSRA mentioned, that Reid tried to hide Riley Cooper on the ground in the end zone:  This was called back as an illegal forward pass; the attempted lateral, again, was longer than any pass in the current Andy Reid playbook or any pass Sam Bradford would ever attempt. And in another moment from that Dream Team Eagles season, as proof that Marshall’s lateral wasn’t the worst play in league history, there was that one time Ronnie Brown decided to lateral on the goal line:  Reid challenged the fumble, which might deserve its own worst-play-ever status. As good — or bad — as those candidates were, I think they pale in comparison to these top five. They’re the worst of the worst for reasons I will explain below. 5. Darius Reynaud’s safety to start the 2013 season. Most of the awful decisions and mistakes you’ve seen were made under duress, with stress and the threat of violence causing players to perform well below expectations. It’s no surprise Yepremian couldn’t throw a pass even a yard forward when he had multiple Washington linebackers weighing down on him. That fact makes Reynaud’s safety even more impressive. Orlovsky ran out of the back of the end zone for a safety, but that was under pressure from a monstrous defensive end in Allen. Reynaud stepped forward out of the end zone to receive a kickoff and then stepped back into the end zone to kneel for a totally unforced safety. And this gets bonus points for being literally the first play of the season for the Titans as the opening kickoff of Week 1. Season-ticket holders should have been allowed a no-questions-asked refund after that. And the Titans still won that game! 4. John Carney’s missed extra point after the River City Relay. This is all context, of course. The 7-7 Saints were seven seconds away from being eliminated from the postseason in Jacksonville and promptly delivered one of the greatest single plays in history, a three-lateral march down the field to make the score 20-19, pending an academic extra point from Carney, who had missed one extra point in the prior eight years. And you can probably guess how that went down:  3. The swinging gate from Washington under Jim Zorn. To be fair, this doesn’t look all that different from what Kirk Cousins does at times:  There’s not anything inherently wrong with the idea of doing a swinging-gate-esque play as part of your special-teams fake packages; there’s just something very flawed about a play in which Washington motions most of its offensive weaponry out to the left side before the two guys left in the middle of the formation allow each of the three down linemen to run free. Hunter Smith should have received hazard pay for that one. 2. Dwayne Rudd’s game-extending helmet toss. This is a Hall of Famer for me. Although the graphics from the clip make the game seem like it’s from 1993, this is actually from the 2002 season opener. The Browns were up 39-37 on the Chiefs with seconds to go and the Chiefs basically down to a Hail Mary to try to win the game. Cleveland got pressure on quarterback Trent Green and forced him into what appeared to be a sack with no time left on the clock, only for Rudd to celebrate prematurely:  First, I love how Chiefs tackle John Tait runs the same way that I imagine I do in my head: like a particularly fast mall-walking grandma. Even more exciting, notice what you see to the left side of the picture. That’s Rudd firing his helmet yards away to celebrate the victory. He tossed his helmet in the same way Von Miller thrusts his hips after sacks, with every single ounce of his body being put into the celebration. That’s Rudd’s helmet toss. And, of course, the Chiefs promptly kicked a game-winning field goal on the very next play. 1. Jim Marshall running 66 yards the wrong way with a fumble for a safety. The no. 1 play, though, is still a classic. Wrong Way Marshall recovering a fumble and taking it to … the other house is football lore.  The Butt Fumble was a fraction of a second of a mistake. Bad kicks and passes are one thing. Running for several seconds in the wrong direction and taking it all the way into your own end zone for a safety is still the one to beat.",2015-10-02T10:46:59+00:00,NFL,Barnwell
48,Julio Jones Is Historically Ridiculous,"You don’t need me to tell you that Julio Jones is ridiculous, but I’m going to anyway. Through three games, Jones’s numbers in Kyle Shanahan’s offensive scheme have been ridiculous. He leads the league in receptions (34) and receiving yards (440), having posted three consecutive games with at least 135 yards to start the season. Jones would tie a league record1 if he posted a fourth consecutive game with at least 135 yards, and it wouldn’t be the only record he’s approaching. Jones hasn’t simply been the best receiver in football through this season-opening three-game stretch; he’s started what looks like it could become one of the great seasons by a receiver in NFL history. Let’s start with the simple stuff. If Jones can stay healthy and maintain this level of production, his stats prorate to astronomical, stratospheric season-ending numbers. He would finish 2015 with 181 catches on 245 targets for 2,347 receiving yards. Those would comfortably be records in each of those categories.2 He’s on pace for 21 receiving touchdowns, which would be the third-highest single-season figure in league history behind Randy Moss’s 2007 and Jerry Rice’s 1987 campaigns. Taken on a per-game basis, Jones’s numbers are equally nuts. He’s averaging 146.7 receiving yards per game. Antonio Brown is right behind him at 145.3 yards per game, a figure that will likely fall as Ben Roethlisberger is replaced by Michael Vick. The league record is the 129.0-yard mark set by Wes Chandler during the 1982 strike season. Over a 16-game season, nobody has topped Calvin Johnson’s 122.8-yard average from 2012. Put it this way: You remember that freakish nine-game stretch from Odell Beckham Jr. last season? That was 133.2 receiving yards per game. Jones has been 10 percent better than ODB was during one of the hottest stretches a wide receiver has ever exhibited. I’m not done. In the context of his team, Jones has also been remarkable. With Roddy White not the option he once was and Devin Hester injured, Jones has dominated the Atlanta passing attack. (To be fair, he very well may have had an equally large share if those guys were healthy.) Through the first three weeks, Jones has been targeted on 40 percent of Matt Ryan’s passes. Again, with the limited target data available going back to the mid-’90s, I can’t find anyone who tops that figure. Jones has 44.1 percent of his team’s receptions through three games, having caught 34 of Ryan’s 77 completed passes. Nobody comes close to that figure, with Tim Brown catching 35.4 percent of Oakland’s passes to set the league mark during a dismal 1997 season for the Raiders. Ryan’s next 17 completions could go to other players, and Jones would still be setting a league mark. And Jones has an unreal 46.5 percent of his team’s receiving yards, a figure that tops Brandon Marshall’s 2012 campaign, when he picked up 1,508 of Chicago’s 3,298 receiving yards, good for 45.7 percent of its receiving output. Hold on, I’m still not done with superlatives. Since 2007, ESPN Stats & Information has tracked the number of routes run by each receiver. We can use receptions per routes run as a measure of how frequently a player is targeted with the football on a per-play basis. Over that time frame, among receivers with 100 routes or more, the record for receptions per route belongs to Wes Welker in 2009, when he caught passes on 27.8 percent of his routes. Jones is at 30.9 percent through three games. He is being fed the football more than anybody else in nearly a decade, if not longer. Maybe it’s unfair to extrapolate three-game performances out to a 16-game season. Let’s put Jones’s numbers in context one more way, by comparing him to how other receivers have started over the first three games. You won’t believe me when I tell you that his numbers are still great: What Jones is doing is historic. And even better, there’s little reason to think that he’ll let up. Watching Jones’s tape from the past three weeks reveals how Shanahan has basically turned him into a supersize Antonio Brown. Jones is moving around the formation and being used at all levels of the passing game. You don’t need me to explain what Jones can do as a downfield weapon, but Shanahan has taken advantage of having a truly dominant wideout for the first time since he had Andre Johnson in Houston by using Jones closer to the line of scrimmage, too. It’s clear Shanahan has given Ryan the freedom to audible out of whatever play he’s called at the line of scrimmage and throw a hot route to Jones whenever he’s left uncovered. Watch here from the first quarter of the game against the Giants, when the offensive line clearly blocks for a run, but, with Jones’s man blitzing off the edge, Ryan instead throws a quick hitch to Jones (before being blasted by a second free blitzer):  Jones goes for 12 there. A couple of plays later, the Falcons pulled the same move to the other side of the field, with a quick throw to an uncovered Jones in the slot for another first down:  And a third from the Cowboys game, where Jones picks up a first down on a slant against Brandon Carr:  And an identical-looking slant from the slot from the Eagles game in Week 1:  These are simple versions of packaged plays, where Ryan has a run play called (watch the offensive linemen blocking upfield) and the option to immediately make a safe throw to Jones. Ryan has attempted 23 passes to Jones within 5 yards of the line of scrimmage this year, completing 17 for 120 yards. Devonta Freeman may have had a nice day against the Cowboys on the ground Sunday, but Atlanta is almost always going to get more yards throwing hitches and slants to Jones than it will pounding the rock behind an oft-struggling offensive line. The Giants eventually adapted and stuck their cornerbacks on the line of scrimmage against Jones as the game went along … and when they sent a big blitz late in the game, they had Prince Amukamara right up on Jones, who promptly shook him at the line and ran past for the game-winning touchdown. On Sunday, the Cowboys learned from the Giants’ early mistakes. They stuck bracket coverage on Jones on most of the plays I saw, with a cornerback up on the line of scrimmage and safety help over the top. The Falcons adapted. Corners are still terrified of Jones’s agility in and out of his breaks and can’t get around his size, so the Falcons adjusted by throwing quick hitches and back-shoulder throws to Jones for steady yardage. They moved him into the slot to get him more matchups against nickel corner Tyler Patmon, who was the primary defender in coverage on Jones’s 45-yard touchdown. It didn’t help when deep safety J.J. Wilcox whiffed on the tackle attempt. The Falcons also use their other receivers to create space and separation for Jones, which seems unfair. Here, in a crucial third-and-short late in the game against the Cowboys, Jones lines up in front of Leonard Hankerson in a two-wideout stack but then releases to the outside to draw Morris Claiborne in coverage. Hankerson clears out the interior defender with his corner route, and when Jones cuts his flat route back inside, Claiborne has no chance of holding up, leaving an easy first down:  Cruelly, they finished the Cowboys off with something totally different. The Falcons brought Jones and White together in a similar-looking stack, with Jones as the trailing receiver this time. Atlanta went with play-action and had White basically block Carr for a second while Jones dragged across the formation behind the line of scrimmage. The Falcons counted on the Cowboys playing man coverage and nobody else besides Carr accounting for Jones as he got lost in the shuffle, and that’s exactly what happened. Claiborne strangely decided to stay at home as both Jones and White ended up wide open for an easy touchdown:  Here’s the problem: There is no easy solution to stopping this stuff. You can’t stop Jones with a single cornerback on the line of scrimmage, even if he’s physical, as you saw when Jones torched Byron Maxwell in Week 1 and beat Amukamara for the game winner in Week 2. You can’t bracket him, like the Cowboys did, because he’s still going to make short catches when Ryan throws him back-shoulder passes and longer ones when the Falcons go with play-action and get him across the field on dig routes. Oh, and with a safety 15 yards away from the play who is unable to key on the offensive line’s motion for the play call, Atlanta is subsequently going to have a numbers advantage running the football, as it did while gashing the Cowboys. As long as (find a piece of wood to knock on right now) Jones continues to stay healthy, there’s little reason to think he can’t keep this up. Even if simple variance suggests he won’t average 146.7 receiving yards per game, he’s going to get the ball as much as anybody in football and in situations where he can make plays after the catch. With apologies to Brown, who may drop out of the running solely because of Vick, Jones is the best receiver in football right now. And as the Falcons have expanded his role and made him the absolute focal point of an offense that’s averaging a Ryan-era-high 29.7 points per game, they’ve been rewarded with historic production and a 3-0 start to the season.",2015-09-29T10:11:54+00:00,NFL,Barnwell
49,Nine Lives: Which Winless Team Will End Up in the Playoffs?,"You probably saw the numbers this week. The exact figure depends on the cutoff you choose, but since the league went to its current divisional structure in 2002, just 10 of the 107 teams that started the season 0-2 ultimately made a postseason run. That’s 9.4 percent. By the end of Week 2, we were left with nine 0-2 teams around the NFL. You can see where I’m going with this one. Even if you fudge the numbers a tiny bit, recent history suggests that a typical season will see just one of those nine 0-2 teams rebound and head into the postseason. The other eight are playing for fantasy football and draft position purposes. Yikes. Given how good some of this year’s 0-2 teams were expected to be heading into the season, it’s perhaps more likely we’ll see two or more of these teams advance into January than we would in other years. FiveThirtyEight’s Elo model suggests that two or three of these teams will make the postseason if they play as expected the rest of the way. Of course, it may also be possible that the numbers don’t know some important detail about these teams that has led them to that fateful 0-2 start. We’re all left simultaneously trying to avoid overreacting to the dismal first two weeks while frantically searching to find what might be a fatal flaw. Football can be confusing, especially in September. If 0-2 is bad, 0-3 is virtually a point of no return. The last team to start 0-3 and make the playoffs was the 1998 Buffalo Bills, who rode Doug Flutie to the playoffs after their initial three-game skid. Eighty-two teams have started 0-3 since without making it to the postseason. It’s not out of the question for a team to do it again, but it’s taking a long shot and stretching it even further. After the 0-2 Giants beat Washington on Thursday night, that leaves us with eight must-win games coming up in Week 3. Let’s run through the nine teams that started 0-2 and try to figure out why they might be the ones to buck history and advance into the postseason. These aren’t power rankings of how these teams would perform in a vacuum, but instead a comparison of their relative playoff chances given their talent level, circumstances, injuries, etc. And it starts with the team I think everyone can agree belongs at the bottom of the list: OK, it’s not exactly easy to find reasons to believe that the Bears should have high hopes for 2015. They weren’t expected to do very much before the season, and after an 0-2 start, they’re about to head to Seattle to face a pissed-off Seahawks team in a home opener that will now include Kam Chancellor. Oh, and because Jay Cutler is injured, Jimmy Clausen — whose only win in a 1-10 career came over John Skelton in 2010 — will be under center for Chicago, with both wideouts who would start for Chicago (Alshon Jeffery and first-rounder Kevin White) likely absent as well. The Bears are the league’s biggest underdogs in Week 3, and it’s exceedingly unlikely they’ll come close to the playoffs. There have been things to like for Chicago this season. The defense was better than expected against Aaron Rodgers in Week 1, albeit in a game where they allowed the Packers to score 31 points, mostly on throws past overmatched starting corner Alan Ball. And the much-maligned Cutler actually played very well for most of his short run against the Cardinals, starting 8-of-8 for 120 yards and a touchdown against the stout Arizona pass defense before throwing a pick-six and injuring his hamstring while trying to tackle Tony Jefferson. Baby steps! But, you know, like a baby with a pulled hamstring. The Lions are already in a lot of trouble. They’ve started the season by losing their first two games on the road by a combined 15 points, and each of those games needed garbage-time touchdowns from Detroit to make things look more competitive than they were. The Lions are already two games behind the Packers and 1.5 games down on the Vikings, given that Minnesota beat the Lions last Sunday. Mike Zimmer’s defense beat up poor Matthew Stafford during that game, knocking him down eight times on 53 dropbacks and leading to a terrifying observation afterward: Stafford was beat up so much, he didn’t even know from which wound he was bleeding all over himself. Crazy. — Kyle Meinke (@kmeinke) September 21, 2015 That sounds like the worst game ever, and while it looks like Stafford will play through a rib injury this weekend, injuries are giving the Lions fits. Star linebacker DeAndre Levy has missed the first two games with a mysterious, unexplained hip injury; the team had to deny rumors this week that Levy was suffering from a Chilean parasite, which seems absurd. Defensive end Ziggy Ansah missed practice time this week. The right side of the offensive line, Larry Warford and LaAdrian Waddle, missed Week 1. Warford is back, and Waddle should make his season debut in Sunday’s game against the Broncos, who have pressured opposing quarterbacks on a league-high 50 percent of dropbacks. If the Lions can’t beat Denver in their home opener, their playoff chances might very well not exist. Much like the Lions, Houston’s performance looks a lot better by virtue of what it’s done late in the fourth quarter of comfortable losses. The Texans went down 27-9 against the Chiefs before two scoring drives in the final five minutes left it as a seven-point loss. Things were closer last week when they scored a touchdown with 6:31 left to make it 24-17, but their attempt to tie included a blocked field goal, two extended drives thanks to Kony Ealy penalties on third down, and a fourth-down conversion before Carolina came up with a fourth-and-16 stop. The problem has been an offense squeezed by poor quarterbacks and injuries. Bill O’Brien benched Brian Hoyer after three quarters for Ryan Mallett and stuck with the backup for the Panthers game, saying Mallett had given the team a “spark.” It seems bad when your team needs a spark in early September. Mallett promptly started the second game 11-of-29 for 74 yards as part of a game plan that eventually saw the overmatched passer throw 58 passes. The offense badly misses Arian Foster, who is likely a week away from returning after groin surgery. Even worse, star wideout DeAndre Hopkins has missed practice this week with a concussion, which would leave Houston with a passing attack built around Mallett throwing to Nate Washington and Cecil Shorts III. On the bright side, the Texans do get to face the Buccaneers. Dumpster fires need sparks, too. Would you believe it: another offense felled by an injury to a totally irreplaceable player! Here, the precious cargo is Drew Brees’s rotator cuff, which was bruised during Sunday’s loss to the Buccaneers. The Saints attempted to take some heat off Brees this offseason by investing in an improved offensive line and doubling down on running backs, but first-round pick Andrus Peat has played just five offensive snaps at tackle, while C.J. Spiller played seven snaps in his season debut last week. The Saints will be happy to see the return of Jairus Byrd and Keenan Lewis from injuries if they can make it back Sunday, but that might not be enough if Brees misses the game. The last time Brees missed a start because of injury was in 2003, when no. 1 receiver Brandin Cooks was in fifth grade. A bruised rotator cuff can be a week-to-week injury; Marc Bulger missed a game with a similar rotator cuff injury in 2009. On the bright side, it would push Luke McCown into the lineup, which would complete the most unlikely run of notoriety Luke McCown ever could have expected after those commercials. The Saints get the Panthers this weekend, and while they’ll be happy to face a Carolina team that hasn’t exactly looked incredible despite a 2-0 start, a loss would put them 3.5 games behind Carolina before October has even begun. Baltimore might have been my pick to win the AFC North before the season, but losing the first two games wasn’t part of the plan. Losing to the Broncos in Week 1 after Steve Smith Sr. dropped a pass in the end zone was one thing, but losing to the Raiders and giving up 37 points in the process was another. Derek Carr even left a few big plays on the field. Could Terrell Suggs have really been that valuable to the defense? Like New Orleans, Baltimore finds itself in a divisional must-win against the current leaders. The Ravens can’t afford to fall three games and a tiebreaker behind the Bengals before the end of September, and while Baltimore may be a narrow favorite in its home opener Sunday, it hasn’t come close to putting together a complete quarter, let alone a complete game. Carr torched the Baltimore secondary last week, and a wildly impressive Bengals offensive line has helped Andy Dalton avoid a single sack or turnover. If that keeps up, the Ravens will be in serious trouble. The Ravens would be strong favorites over the Giants on a neutral field, but here, the situation favors Big Blue. Granted, I’m cheating and counting the victory the Giants claimed last night to get out of the NFC East cellar, but the Giants have now had double-digit leads in the fourth quarter of each of their three games. Granted, they’ve managed to hold on to exactly one of them, but it’s still a sign that they’re playing well in otherwise-meaningful situations before playing some incredibly unclutch situational football. It will disappear quickly because the Giants won the game, but let’s not forget about Tom Coughlin’s latest fourth-quarter mistake. Here, Coughlin threw his challenge flag after a Washington touchdown, costing the Giants their final timeout. It’s inexcusable for a head coach to make that sort of mistake, especially a veteran coach like Coughlin. It was certainly the most “Dad, you’re embarrassing me” penalty a coach can get, and it makes me wonder whether teams will eventually have their head coach cede challenge duties in the same way they occasionally give up play-calling duties. The newly clutch Giants weren’t all that different last night. The late score that appeared to seal it was a third-down lob from Eli Manning to a covered Rueben Randle that was bobbled and then grabbed out of space for a touchdown. The Giants promptly allowed a kickoff return for a touchdown and then had Manning throw another ugly pass on third down, extending the game. It didn’t matter, because Kirk Cousins appears to develop a low-grade fever when he faces the Giants on national television, but — sadly, for the Giants defense — they don’t get to play Cousins every week. This team should be 3-0; instead, it’s just happy to be 1-2. Even knowing that the Eagles are a half-game behind the Giants and a game and a half behind the Cowboys in the wide-open NFC East, I like their chances a little more than those of the Giants. It’s far easier to imagine the Eagles making the sort of adjustments they need, given the talent they have, than it is to believe that the Giants will suddenly blossom a couple of offensive linemen and a safety and a pass-rusher by the end of the season. The improvements have to come, to some extent, from Chip Kelly. Chris Brown noted on Twitter how Philadelphia’s play-calling was so obvious by virtue of how stagnant their personnel groupings and spacing on offense have been. Reacting to last week’s disastrous performance from Sam Bradford and this offense, it wouldn’t surprise me to see Kelly really focus on showing different looks to the opposition starting Sunday against the Jets. He almost has to make schematic changes, given that it’s too early to make personnel decisions like benching Bradford or DeMarco Murray (who may not even play given his hamstring injury). Even if Kelly does, the offense may still struggle to get going. The Jets may be lucky to have recovered all eight fumbles under Todd Bowles, but the former Arizona defensive coordinator brought in a bevy of defensive backs this offseason and has installed his favored blitz-happy scheme. Darrelle Revis (questionable with a groin injury) and the rest of his defensive backfield brethren can hold up against Philadelphia’s athletes in man coverage, freeing Bowles to send exotic pressures at Bradford, who is already naturally inclined to check down. With the Giants choking and the combination of Tony Romo and Dez Bryant both injured, the Eagles could possibly be in a more advantageous spot than they were before the season started, even at 0-2. Per FiveThirtyEight, the Seahawks had a league-best 78 percent chance of making the playoffs before the season started. Now, just two weeks later, their odds are down to 56 percent. If the unthinkable happens and they lose at home to Chicago this weekend, the Seahawks will be in serious danger of falling below 50 percent. As 14-point favorites, that seems extremely unlikely. Seattle should really be concerned less about this week and more about the weeks to come. After the Bears, four of Seattle’s next five games come against 2014 playoff teams. And while I’m not super high on Detroit or Cincinnati, a stretch that includes them alongside the Panthers and Cowboys won’t be easy. The Seahawks won’t have to deal with Romo during their crucial November 1 meeting since he is on short-term IR and won’t be eligible to return. If the defense fixes itself (and it should) and the offense gets just enough Jimmy Graham to get going, the Seahawks should be fine. Their concern at this point is less about the playoffs and more about beating the Cardinals for first place in the NFC West. As bad as they’ve been, the Colts are no. 1 for me. I wrote Monday about why they should improve in the weeks to come, and much of that boils down to schedule. Indy is about to start a three-game run through the AFC South, and by the end of that stretch, it wouldn’t surprise me if it was atop the division at 3-2.",2015-09-25T09:56:20+00:00,NFL,Barnwell
50,The Eagles on the Brink,"If it’s ever going to happen for the Eagles, now is the time. Philadelphia has hit its bye week. It has two weeks to make whatever changes are necessary to spark its flagging offense, which is 28th in Expected Points Added per drive through seven games. Since hitting the reset button on the moves Chip Kelly made this offseason doesn’t appear to be an option, the Eagles are left with precious few choices for improving that attack. While Kelly will unquestionably make some schematic choices during the downtime, there’s one obvious personnel move that would shake things up. Should the Eagles bench Sam Bradford? By any objective measure you can find, Bradford has been subpar. He’s last in the league among starting quarterbacks in QBR; his 29.6 figure is 8.6 points below the second-worst passer, preseason MVP candidate Andrew Luck. Bradford is 29th in passer rating, 30th in adjusted net yards per attempt, and 24th in individual DVOA. This also isn’t a case where the numbers struggle to match up with what Bradford looks like on tape. There is exactly one stretch of the 2015 regular season in which Bradford looked remotely assured or confident in Philadelphia’s offense: the second half of the season opener in Atlanta, when he went 21-of-25 for 219 yards with a touchdown before throwing an interception that bounced off Jordan Matthews’s hands. It’s a far cry from the quarterback who was this good in the preseason: Source says #Eagles no longer engaged with Sam Bradford in attempt negotiate short-term extension. His preseason success changed dynamics — Ed Werder (@Edwerderespn) September 9, 2015 The dynamics have changed again. It’s useless to bench Bradford out of spite for failing to live up to those preseason expectations. And it’s not as if the Eagles have an obviously superior option on their bench, either, given that their backups are Mark Sanchez and Thad Lewis. Tim Tebow failed to make the team, trade options like Colin Kaepernick aren’t exactly lighting things up elsewhere, and unless Kelly wants to go for a former Oregon starter like Dennis Dixon, the free-agent pool isn’t going to hold somebody who can learn Kelly’s scheme in a matter of days. And at the same time, the Eagles can’t afford to make a speculative, high-risk decision right now. They’re still in the thick of the playoff race in the NFC East. Despite their 3-4 start, ESPN’s Football Power Index gives Philadelphia a 60.6 percent chance of making the playoffs. They unquestionably swapped Nick Foles out for Bradford this offseason in the hopes of finding a higher-ceiling quarterback, given that Foles had been successful in Kelly’s system, had a much lower salary, and didn’t have anywhere near the pedigree Bradford had as the first overall pick in the 2010 draft. And that’s without considering the draft-pick compensation, which was weighted St. Louis’s way. It’s obviously disappointing that Bradford appears unlikely to reach that potential, but that’s an issue the Eagles can’t really concern themselves with at the moment. They’ll have to take another shot at addressing the thorny problem of finding their quarterback for the next 10 years this offseason. For now, they need to find the guy who will give them the best chance of winning this season. And so, instead of considering the ceiling, Kelly has to look down and transition to worrying about the floor. Does Bradford give the Eagles a better chance of staying competitive and succeeding than the alternatives at hand? Let’s first remember why the Eagles actually went out and acquired Bradford in the first place. For whatever skills he had exhibited as a passer, the most promising aspect of his performance in St. Louis had to be his aversion to throwing interceptions. Bradford threw picks on just 2.2 percent of his passes with the Rams, the sixth-lowest figure among players who threw 1,500 passes or more over that time frame. You can understand the appeal for the Eagles, who turned the ball over more frequently than any other team last year. Well, things aren’t much better this year. Philly is turning the ball over on 16.5 percent of its possessions, the fourth-worst rate in the league. The chief offender, surprisingly, is Bradford. He has thrown a league-high 10 interceptions through seven games, good for a 3.6 percent interception rate. He has never been this cavalier about turning the ball over; the only other time he’s ever thrown as many as eight picks over seven games was during the first seven games of his NFL career. If you’re an Eagles fan, that should either terrify you or give you some hope. It’s distressing to see Bradford regress so badly at the one aspect of his game that seemed stable, but he also seemed to undergo an adjustment period during the first two months of his career before eventually settling in as an interception-shy passer. It’s not crazy to think that Bradford might need to undergo a similar stretch in his new offense before improving, especially given that he hadn’t played against a live pass rush since the middle of 2013 because of two ACL tears. It could also be randomness; Tom Brady has thrown picks on 1.9 percent of his passes as a pro but had a seven-game stretch with nine picks in 2011. It happens. The Eagles coaching staff has also suggested the interceptions are in part the fault of Bradford’s receivers. It’s fair to say he hasn’t gotten a ton of help this year, but I’m not entirely sure I’d put too much blame on the guys catching those passes. Watching those 10 picks again, there are only three where you can really make a case that Bradford was harmed by his target. In addition to the aforementioned Matthews drop in Week 1, Bradford had a pass bounce off (a well-covered) Zach Ertz’s hands downfield late in the fourth quarter of Week 2, then had Riley Cooper stop on a route for another interception in Week 6. The other seven picks sure look to be Bradford’s fault. Bradford’s receivers also didn’t offer much assistance against the Panthers on Sunday night, as they dropped seven of his 46 attempts. That’s the highest drop percentage (15.2 percent) that any team’s receivers have posted in a game this season. And indeed, they’ve been dropping too many of Bradford’s passes all year; their season-long drop rate of 5.8 percent is the highest in football, placing them narrowly ahead of the Jets (5.7 percent), Texans (5.5 percent), and Giants (5.4 percent). To be fair, seven of Philadelphia’s 16 drops this season came in Sunday’s game, and it’s not like Bradford was phenomenal before the Carolina trip. Drop rate also doesn’t encapsulate how much work Bradford’s receivers are doing to catch passes that would fall incomplete on most teams. After watching Bradford play and seeing enough of the league to get a representative sample of how frequently that happens elsewhere, I think it’s fair to say that he is also getting bailed out by his receivers a fair amount of the time, too. Bradford’s accuracy was supposed to be his calling card, especially on the short-to-intermediate throws he almost exclusively threw in St. Louis. During that second half in Atlanta, Bradford was virtually unstoppable throwing shallow crosses and option routes over and over again. It was never going to be quite that easy on a weekly basis, but it wasn’t out of the question to imagine Bradford picking people apart with safe, accurate passes as the basis of an efficient offense. Not counting the drops, Bradford is completing 65.9 percent of his passes, which doesn’t seem too awful, given that the league average on non-drops is 66.0 percent. I split those figures out by the distance Bradford’s passes have traveled in the air and compared them to the league-average completion rates on those same throws to see where he was struggling. You’ll see where the problems rest: As much as Bradford has struggled throwing deep in years past, his real issue this season has been in the intermediate range, on those throws from 11 to 20 yards downfield. Bradford’s QBR on those throws is a league-worst 5.8. Five of Bradford’s 10 picks have come on throws in that range. And do you know who had the best QBR in the league on throws in that split between 2013 and 2014? Why, it was Nick Foles, who posted a 97.5 QBR on passes in that 10-yard range! That’s an enormous swing. Sanchez, for what it’s worth, was at a 76.7 QBR across 77 attempts on those same passes last year. Teams aren’t afraid of Bradford beating them downfield, so they’re very comfortable clogging up those intermediate routes with defenders. Opposing defenses also aren’t blitzing the Eagles very frequently, leaving more men in coverage to break up (and possibly pick off) Bradford’s passes. Bradford’s been blitzed on just 15.4 percent of his dropbacks, the lowest rate in football. The Eagles have struggled to create holes in the running game after shedding former starting guards Todd Herremans and Evan Mathis this offseason, but pass protection hasn’t been a concern. Bradford has being pressured on just 17.7 percent of his dropbacks, the third-lowest rate in football, trailing only Andy Dalton and Eli Manning. He’s taking sacks less frequently than league average and he also uses more time before his passes, 2.55 seconds, than the baseline. It’s perpetually difficult to separate the concerns of whether the passing game is negatively affecting the running game or vice versa, but it’s clear there are issues both ways. The Eagles have shifted their running game as the season’s progressed, using their sweep play far more frequently in an attempt to take advantage of their speed. If the Eagles can’t stretch the field vertically, Kelly seems to be thinking, they might as well try to stretch defenses horizontally. I’ve heard the argument that the Eagles are somehow wasting DeMarco Murray by sticking him in the shotgun, given how he excelled when Dallas was under center during his breakout 2014, but I’m skeptical. Murray wasn’t quite as effective last year when the Cowboys did go to him in the shotgun, but he did average a relatively useful 4.8 yards per carry on his 25 touches there. He’s down to 3.9 yards per carry on his league-leading 72 shotgun carries this season, but when the Eagles have gone under center, Murray’s been a mess. His 16 carries there have gone for a total of 28 yards.1 Ryan Mathews’s 15 carries from the same spot have produced 71 yards. It’s not enough of a sample to bench Murray, of course, but he hasn’t shown any evidence that the Eagles should bend their offense to work around his strengths. The other reality is that all parties involved should have known what they were getting into. Murray was coming to a team that wanted to operate out of the shotgun, and the Eagles were getting a back who was going to be more comfortable, especially at first, in an offense where the quarterback was under center. Kelly obviously thought he could overcome those concerns and coach Murray into the back he was imagining. The same was true for Bradford, whose issues fitting into the Philadelphia offense based on his performance in St. Louis were clear the moment the trade occurred. It’s not necessarily a surprise there has been an adjustment period. And as disappointing as Bradford has been, it’s not clear that Sanchez is a better option. He posted a 59.3 QBR last year, which was far superior to what Bradford’s done this year, but that was with a better running game and Jeremy Maclin, who is sorely missed every time the Eagles throw the ball to Miles Austin or Riley Cooper. (The Eagles could also sure use a healthy Nelson Agholor, who has just 17 targets and a high ankle sprain that should keep him out until November.) The biggest concern with Sanchez, though, was the same thing that has ailed Bradford: turnovers. Sanchez threw picks on 3.6 percent of his passes in 2014, just as Bradford has this season. And there’s far more reason to think Bradford will improve in that category, given that he threw picks far less frequently with the Rams. Sanchez threw interceptions 3.7 percent of the time as a member of the Jets and is also far more prone to fumbling, coughing the ball up 50 times in 3,517 career snaps; Bradford has lost the ball only 31 times in 3,592 snaps. The best argument I can make for Sanchez is a stylistic one. He has been better throwing downfield than Bradford, and you could understand why that might be useful in this particular offense, given how bad the running game’s been. Philadelphia’s typical third down this year has come with 7.8 yards to go for a conversion, the fifth-highest rate in the league. The Eagles have to throw downfield more than most teams to survive, and Bradford has been terrible throwing downfield throughout his career, both in terms of frequency and success rate. In terms of actual value, though, I don’t think there’s an appreciable difference between Bradford and Sanchez. And in that case, I always argue that it behooves a head coach to stick with the quarterback he has while resisting the easy switch to a similarly skilled backup, if only because it basically puts you all in with the second passer. Once you make the switch, it’s almost impossible to go back. Think about what happened in Houston this year. Bill O’Brien started the year with Brian Hoyer and promptly benched him for Ryan Mallett during the fourth quarter of Week 1. When Mallett struggled under similar circumstances in subsequent weeks, O’Brien was basically stuck with Mallett as his quarterback until garbage time and injuries intervened to hand the job back to Hoyer, a move that disenfranchised Mallett altogether. O’Brien started with two mediocre quarterbacks and ended with two mediocre quarterbacks who had no confidence.2 It’s not crazy to imagine that occurring in Philadelphia if Kelly makes the switch to Sanchez. As much as Bradford has struggled, you can build a case that he needs more time to settle in the job than most other newly acquired passers. And while Sanchez’s 2014 was better than Bradford’s 2015, the Eagles traded for Bradford because they weren’t happy with what Sanchez accomplished during his half-year as the starter. The gap between the two isn’t large enough to justify turning the season over to Sanchez, at least not yet.

51,Week 7 Picks: Welcome to Finding Your NFL Roots,"Let’s just get it out of the way: Even I think the term “football babies” is a little creepy, but it’s going to be the way we get into this Friday’s picks column. No, this isn’t a reference to that unrelenting, awful “Bengal babies” NFL Shop commercial from last season; it’s our shared way of comparing players and teams to similar-yet-more-impressive archetypes. I’m guessing it predates Harold Miner taking the “Baby Jordan” nickname, but that’s the classic example. That Miner comparison also points out how the idea can go horribly wrong. In a football context, it usually works in terms of comparing a player at one position to a younger, still-developing player at the same spot in the lineup. As an example, let’s use a player on bye this week. It’s totally fair to think of Cincinnati tight end Tyler Eifert as the baby Rob Gronkowski. Eifert’s athleticism, size, and soft hands make him virtually uncoverable at times, as is the case with Gronk. He has been similarly productive this season; Eifert is on pace for a 75-catch, 912-yard, 16-touchdown season, which is a small step down from Gronk’s 82-1,124-12 line from 2014. They even wear the same enormous elbow brace. Of course, Eifert isn’t quite up there with Gronkowski. His production, while impressive, doesn’t reach Gronk’s historically lofty heights. Eifert hasn’t done it as long as Gronk has, so it’s tougher to put him on a pedestal with Gronkowski. And he isn’t anywhere near as effective as a blocker. Gronkowski is quietly one of the best blocking tight ends in football, while Eifert’s most memorable moment as a blocker this year was when Elvis Dumervil blew by him for a strip-sack that produced a Ravens defensive touchdown. That’s why he’s Baby Gronk. I’m going to run through this week’s picks and identify a player in each matchup who can claim to be a slightly lesser version of a similar player (or archetype, or something silly). They won’t all work quite as well as Gronkowski-to-Eifert, but that has never stopped me before. I started the week off by taking the Seahawks -6.5 last night. As always, the home teams are in CAPS and the odds listed are the consensus lines from vegasinsider.com … Baby Joe Philbin: Gus Bradley If the Jaguars lose this week, it’s not out of the question that they could follow their in-state brethren’s lead and leave their head coach in London. The returns on the Bradley era in Jacksonville were never supposed to be quick, but things are looking dire for the third consecutive season. The Jags are 1-5, and their one win was by three points over those same dreadful Dolphins. It was one thing when the Jaguars were being held back by an offense that was dead on arrival and a roster that was bereft of talent, but that’s not the case anymore. Blake Bortles made some terrible decisions last week, but he’s comfortably better this year than he was last season; after posting a league-worst 25.2 QBR last year, he’s up to 60.9 so far in 2015. Instead, the defense has been struggling, even after adding multiple veteran free agents this offseason. The Jags are 27th in DVOA through six weeks, and even if some of that is due to the fact that they played the Patriots, the second-best offense they’ve faced over that time frame is … Carolina? Bradley failed to adjust during the second half last week, when nominal no. 1 corner Davon House was locked up against DeAndre Hopkins and repeatedly torched. I don’t think the Jaguars should give serious thought to firing Bradley before the end of the season, even if there’s a ready-made replacement on staff in offensive line coach Doug Marrone. At some point, though, his seat has to start getting hot. He’s started 8-30 (.211) as head coach, similar to the three-year runs of recent failed defensive wizards turned head coaches like Steve Spagnuolo and Rod Marinelli (each 10-38, a .208 win percentage). Dennis Allen was 8-28 when the Raiders fired him last year. The only coach since the NFL merger to get a fourth season with the same team after three seasons with a worse winning percentage than Bradley is John McKay, who was coaching the expansion Bucs. It’s hard to imagine a must-win game for Bradley and the Jaguars, but given that he’s facing a Bills team that will be starting EJ Manuel at quarterback, this is a sure-would-be-nice-to-win week for the struggling Jags head coach. Baby J.J. Watt: Aaron Donald OK, you already know this one, given that we were making comparisons between Watt and Donald before the 2014 draft after Donald’s freakish performance during the 2014 combine. Donald’s subsequent performance as Defensive Rookie of the Year only sealed things. So let’s twist this a bit and go back in Rams history to find a comparison for a player who is currently on bye: Baby Steven Jackson: Matt Forte This is less about Forte’s skill level (which is higher than Jackson’s) and more about where he is in his career, toiling as one of the league’s most underrated backs for a perennially frustrating football team. Like Jackson, Forte’s versatile skill set made him the focus of the offense on some pretty good teams early in his career; while Jackson (amazingly) never managed to play on a single NFL team with a winning record, the relative best seasons of his career came when the Rams hit .500 with a pair of seasons early in his career. Jackson was able to keep his production at a relatively high level, even while the team around him collapsed, which it’s fair to say the Bears have done around Forte. They’ve both even struggled around the goal line as pros, producing rushing touchdown totals that pale in comparison to their carry figures. Forte’s had higher highs, but they share a similar story. Baby Brandon Weeden: Alex Smith No, it’s not good when I’m saying you’re the poor man’s version of a backup who was already benched for Matt Cassel in a panic, but that’s where we are with Smith during a very disappointing 2015 season. Smith is completing 62.4 percent of his passes, which doesn’t sound all that bad, but he’s throwing some of the shortest passes in football. For comparison, here are the other 10 quarterbacks at the bottom of the air yard charts and what they’re averaging in terms of completion percentage: The other nine quarterbacks in that group have an average completion percentage six full percentage points higher than Smith. Failing to complete short passes is a recipe for disaster, and given Smith’s usual propensity for taking sacks to avoid turnovers, his QBR is down to a lowly 34.3. Only Sam Bradford (31.6) sits below Smith in the QBR charts. Baby Dan Henning: Dan Campbell Insert your favorite run-happy coach from the past, since Campbell decided his way to rebuild the Dolphins overnight was to go back to the sluggish offenses he ran as a player under Bill Parcells in Dallas. I mentioned last week that the Dolphins were the league’s most pass-happy team on first down, throwing the ball 71.2 percent of the time under Joe Philbin. While the Dolphins were in a favorable game situation most of the way, on first downs against the Titans last week, they ran the ball 11 times and threw it on 15 occasions. Campbell reemphasized second tight end Dion Sims (38 snaps) at the expense of Greg Jennings (nine snaps) and gave defensive tackle Earl Mitchell as many snaps on offense (six) as wide receiver DeVante Parker, the team’s first-round pick this year. It’s tempting to credit Campbell’s shifts for their success, but it’s often true that interim coaches quickly look better than the guys they replaced by sheer regression toward the mean; teams that play poorly enough to justify their head coach’s sacking in midseason improve, but so do teams that play similarly poorly without firing their head coach. The biggest difference between the Philbin Dolphins and the Campbell version after one week, truthfully, was what a healthy Cameron Wake did up front on defense. Baby Marshawn Lynch: Chris Ivory You have to admit, this one fits. Ivory is playing the best football of his career, but when he’s at this level, he looks a lot like Seattle’s star back, and it’s not just the hair. Lynch’s punishing style requires no introduction, but his career really shifted midway through his second season with the Seahawks, when he met with Tom Cable and became a far more patient back. Likewise, Ivory has always been a burly, bruising bowling ball of knives, but what looks different this year is how he’s attacking the line of scrimmage. Ivory is taking more time behind the line to find his running lane and he’s getting farther upfield before taking contact in the process; he’s averaging 2.73 yards before contact this season, up from 2.06 yards before contact in 2014. The Jets also had success last week pitching him the ball on plays designed to go up the middle, allowing Ivory to get to top speed quicker than he would on a traditional handoff. It also doesn’t hurt the comparison when you consider that Ivory is playing behind a line that includes James Carpenter and Breno Giacomini, both of whom cut their teeth blocking for Lynch in Seattle. The Pats rank 29th in rush defense DVOA, so if the Jets expect to win in New England, they’ll probably need to give the Pats a steady dose of Ivory. Baby Antonio Brown: Stefon Diggs OK, let’s take this one slow. This is more like embryonic Antonio Brown, given that we’re really just two games into Diggs’s career, but you can see how it’s easy to compare their respective stories. Brown was a sixth-round pick coming out of a lesser school (Central Michigan) who fell in the draft because he was undersized and had a reputation as a hothead. Diggs, who went to Maryland, lacks ideal size and fell to the fifth round due to concerns over his character. He was taken 23 picks after Vince Mayle, whom the Browns released before the end of training camp. It would be incredibly unfair to compare anybody to Brown after two games, but you can already begin to see why Mike Wallace, who played with both Brown and Diggs, made the comparison this week. Diggs is already naturally using his athleticism and route-running ability to create separation; there’s a reason he’s gotten nine targets in each of his first two games. Charles Johnson is back this week, but Diggs is keeping his starting job. He might not be Antonio Brown, but there’s something here. Baby Richard Sherman: Desmond Trufant Dan Quinn’s defense hasn’t been great through six weeks, but even 20th in DVOA is a huge step forward for a unit that was dead last under Mike Nolan last year. They’ve been far healthier on the defensive side of the ball this year, and they’ve finally developed the beginnings of a pass rush after drafting Vic Beasley in the first round, but their one true star is at cornerback. Nobody is noticing how great Trufant is, but that’s because teams simply aren’t throwing the football in his direction. When Quinn was with the Seahawks, he almost always kept Sherman in his preferred spot at left cornerback, facing the right side of the offense. It’s only in recent weeks that new Seahawks coordinator Kris Richard has moved Sherman around the formation, doing so against the Bengals two weeks ago and then, last night, against Torrey Smith during Seattle’s victory over the 49ers. Quinn’s new star pupil is Trufant, and like he did with Sherman, Quinn is keeping Trufant at home, and other teams are terrified to throw in his direction. If you split an NFL field up horizontally into five zones, the most frequently trafficked zone is the right sideline: 25.7 percent of passes have gone there this season; no other zone is above 22.6 percent. Can you guess which defense is seeing the smallest percentage of passes thrown against it heading to the right sideline? Sure enough, it’s Atlanta, at a league-low 17.1 percent. Teams have thrown 42 passes in that area, but many of those throws have been with other defenders in coverage. I watched Trufant against the Saints last week, and while breaking down coverages is a guessing game, my estimate is that Drew Brees targeted him maybe twice across 39 pass attempts. Most of the time, Brees didn’t even look over to that side of the field. Trufant is erasing the most popular space on the field for opposing quarterbacks. If Sherman is still the best cornerback in football, Trufant’s not far off. Baby Tommy Maddox: Kirk Cousins The bad news is that Kirk Cousins absolutely melted down against the Jets during the second half last week, going 9-of-20 for 75 yards with two interceptions while posting a QBR of 1.8. He is already up to eight interceptions in six games, having posted four two-pick games over that time span. He’s averaging a dismal 6.2 yards per attempt. The good news is that his interception rate is down by nearly a full percentage point from last year, having dropped all the way from 4.4 percent to 3.5 percent. OK, back to the bad news. Even with the slightly lower interception rate, Cousins is still turning the ball over far too frequently for his own good. I noted that Cousins had the worst era-adjusted interception rate in modern NFL history for quarterbacks through three seasons before the season; in comparing his career to the full careers of every other passer with 500 attempts or more since the merger, Pro-Football-Reference’s index statistics suggest that Cousins has been the eighth-worst quarterback since 1970 in terms of throwing interceptions. The same index statistics suggest that Cousins has been moderately below league-average at his other tasks, which provides for a seeming ancestor in Maddox: Maddox had to go to the XFL to prove his mettle before eventually winning a playoff game with the Steelers. I, for one, would love to see Kirk Cousins in the XFL. Baby Philip Rivers: Literally Philip Rivers’s Baby Philip Rivers’s eighth child is on the way. There’s no joke there. That’s just incredible. I can’t even watch television when I write without getting distracted, and Philip Rivers plays quarterback and comes home to seven kids. The due date for Rivers’s seventh child coincided with a trip to Jacksonville in 2013; the San Diego Union-Tribune asked what Rivers would do if the baby came while he was in Florida, to which he replied, “FaceTime, I reckon.” That’s the greatest quote I’ve ever heard in my life. Next time anybody asks how to get in touch with you, don’t give them a business card or your email address or anything like that. “FaceTime, I reckon.” That’s all you need. Baby Richard Seymour: Fletcher Cox The best part of a front seven that tormented poor Eli Manning last Monday night, Cox is coming into his own as a pass-rusher. He has shown flashes in the past, but we’re seeing the former first-rounder take a leap this season. Cox jumped off of the tape at times last year, but he finished the season with four sacks and seven quarterback knockdowns. Those are good figures for a player who often has to play the thankless, stat-shunning role of a two-gap interior lineman, but they undersell how gifted Cox is as an interior rusher. He has nearly matched those figures this year, and it has only taken six games. Cox already has five sacks and five quarterback knockdowns, highlighted by a three-sack performance against the Saints two weeks ago. Cox is never going to have the freedom to penetrate and make plays like a Warren Sapp/Geno Atkins–type interior tackle in a 4-3 while he’s in Philly’s 3-4, but there’s a lot of Seymour in his game, as a very good run defender who is simply too athletic to avoid getting into the backfield on a regular basis. Baby Mark Ingram of 2011 to 2013: Mark Ingram of 2015 The decision to trade up to grab Mark Ingram in 2011 was one of Mickey Loomis’s most baffling calls as Saints general manager. The team already had a cheap power back in the aforementioned Chris Ivory, and Ingram’s skill set didn’t seem to fit New Orleans’s pass-happy approach. Ingram struggled mightily in the offense during his first two seasons, averaging 3.9 yards per carry in an offense that typically created huge holes the rare times it chose to run the football. He showed brief signs of life during an abbreviated 2013, and after an impressive preseason, Ingram averaged 4.3 yards per carry over 226 carries in 2014, earning him a contract extension from Loomis this offseason. Things aren’t looking up in 2015, though. Ingram is back to his old self. He has looked slower this year, and has averaged just 3.5 yards per carry through his first 88 carries. New Orleans’s offensive line hasn’t been impressive, but Ingram hasn’t come close to breaking a big run, as his longest carry of the year has gone for just 17 yards. It’s too early to say that the decision to re-sign Ingram was foolish, but there’s far more evidence that he isn’t a very good NFL back than there is that he’s a meaningful game changer. While 2014 seemed like a breakthrough year, it might have simply been a blip. Baby Trent Richardson: Andre Williams Ingram is still a sight better than Andre Williams. Forever dedicated to running over defenders at the expense of literally doing anything else to get past them, Williams has been one of the least efficient runners in football during his first two seasons in the league. After averaging 3.3 yards per rush as a rookie, Williams is down to 2.8 yards per carry so far during his sophomore campaign. He had one 35-yard run against the Falcons in Week 2 on a play where an Atlanta linebacker horribly overpursued the play. His other 44 carries have gone for a total of 92 yards. That’s 2.1 yards per carry. There really aren’t many backs of this era who have been less efficient. Among guys with 250 carries or more since 2000, Williams’s rushing average is the third-worst, at 3.24 yards per attempt. Fourth? Trent Richardson, at 3.31 yards per rush. And Richardson, for his foibles, was a much better receiver than Williams is. It seems weird to say “was” for a back who is 25, but Richardson feels like a player from the past. At least until he signs with the Cardinals and runs for 2,000 yards. Speaking of … Baby Bill Belichick: Bruce Arians There hasn’t been quite as much Super Bowl success early in Arians’s career as a head coach, no. But think about it. Arians gets the most out of veterans (like Chris Johnson) other teams have discarded, just like Belichick. Arians had to be discarded by an organization from the AFC North that didn’t know what it had, just like Belichick, before finding success elsewhere. Arians even has a piece of signature clothing, with his Kangol a match for Belichick’s infamous hoodie. More than anything, Arians seems to love stomping on inferior teams the way Belichick does. Remember a few weeks ago, when the Cardinals were up 31-7 at halftime on the 49ers and Arians went into the locker room and said “If you relax, I’ll be looking for new people. Put your foot on their throat” to his team? And then promptly went for it on fourth down inside the red zone up 40-7 in the fourth quarter? Doesn’t that seem like something Belichick would do? Since 2001, nobody has destroyed bad teams like Belichick and his Patriots. They’ve beaten teams with losing records by 20 points or more a whopping 43 times. Nobody else in the league has done it 33 times. Arians’s Cardinals have already pulled that feat off three times across their past five games. They’ll be itching to pick up a fourth blowout win on Monday night. THIS WEEK: 1-0

52,NFL Week 6 Takeaways: What the Snapfu?,"The most anticipated regular-season matchup of 2015 was more of a stern rebuke than an eff-you game, but the Patriots will hardly care given the result. The Colts made it to halftime with a lead for the first time in the one-sided Tom Brady–Andrew Luck series, but history repeated itself in the second half. Bill Belichick’s teams outscored Luck and Chuck Pagano 188-73 during the first four encounters between the Colts and Pats, and while the outcome wasn’t quite as lopsided this time around, the Patriots took the game with 14 second-half points before a garbage-time touchdown from the Colts left the final score at 34-27. That second half, of course, featured one of the more bizarre plays in recent memory, when the Colts called for something vaguely resembling a fake punt from fourth-and-3 from their own 37-yard line. I’m calling it the Snapfu: NORMAL FOOTBALL PLAY https://t.co/oSOoJTpmct — Jon Bois (@jon_bois) October 19, 2015 OK. Let’s just get this one out of the way. You might remember that I wrote about the worst plays in NFL history a few weeks ago. Third on the list was Jim Zorn’s “swinging gate,” a fake field goal where virtually the entire offensive line motioned to the left side of the field. Washington holder Hunter Smith took the snap and was immediately besieged by Giants before throwing up a panicked Hail Mary, which didn’t go well:  Looks similar, right? There are a couple of plays you can run out of the swinging-gate concept, but the obvious one for the Colts would have been a screen pass. The Colts were lined up in an illegal formation since nobody but the center was on the line of scrimmage, but had they been lined up properly, nominal quarterback Colt Anderson had two receivers and seven blockers against six Patriots defenders on the right side of the field. The other idea would pop up if the opponent overcompensates for the unexpected motion and sends eight or nine defenders after the traveling band of linemen. That leaves a center and a quarterback in the middle of the field against two or three defenders, and it’s usually pretty easy to pick up a few yards with that much space. I suspect that the Colts probably had that in mind for Anderson, who might not have thrown a pass since junior high school. The most plausible explanation is that Griff Whalen and Anderson were only supposed to actually run a play if the numbers were favorable for a fake. If the numbers weren’t right, which they were not, Whalen wasn’t supposed to snap the football. The Colts were surely hoping the motion would force Bill Belichick to burn a timeout or that one of the Patriots defenders would make some sort of mental mistake and step offside at the sound of the vaunted Colt Anderson hard count, but that didn’t happen, either. Instead, Whalen snapped the football. I wish I could tell you why Whalen snapped the ball. Maybe he didn’t bother to sufficiently look around and recognize that he didn’t have the appropriate numbers in the box to run the play as planned, which is possible when you use a player who isn’t normally a center to snap the ball.1 Maybe Whalen saw the play clock about to strike double-zero and panicked. Maybe he went all Leeroy Jenkins2 and decided to snap the ball, damn the torpedoes. I suspect we’ll never get a straight answer, in part because Whalen himself may not even know why he snapped the ball. The story is already slowly becoming that the fake punt was the turning point that cost the Colts the game, but I doubt that, given that the Colts were already down six points late in the third quarter and about to punt the ball. They were already extremely unlikely to win the game; their win expectancy before the fourth-down play was 21.7 percent.3 Afterward, it was 15.0 percent. That, combined with the significant likelihood that Whalen was instructed not to snap the football, is why I can’t get onboard with the idea that the decision to try the fake punt should get Chuck Pagano fired, even if Pagano took the blame afterward. (Indeed, Pagano could be seen after the play saying something to the effect of “Why did you snap the ball?”) The game wasn’t quite a lost cause, but coaches make routinely worse decisions on a weekly basis; Jim Caldwell’s decision to kick a field goal down seven points late in the fourth quarter in Detroit, for one, was patently worse. Pagano’s play call was questionable, but it was the execution of the Snapfu that was truly dreadful. Pagano is going to get a bad rap for that infamous mistake, but I actually thought he did a very good job of coaching this game. The Colts came in as 8.5-point underdogs, the largest spread they’ve faced at home since Luck arrived in 2012, and Pagano coached like somebody who knew that his team wasn’t going to win a straight-up fight. The Colts needed to pull a few tricks out of their sleeves to win, and Pagano pursued David Strategies throughout the game to try to outfox the heavily favored Patriots. Indy rightfully ignored the orthodoxy of scoring three points first in a game that was likely to be a shootout and went for it on fourth-and-1 from the 5-yard line on its first possession, with Luck throwing a fade to Donte Moncrief for a touchdown. Later in the first half, Pagano called for an unexpected onside kick, an underutilized tactic that nearly produced an extra possession when the ball bounced behind New England’s front line and up in the air for grabs, only for the Patriots to recover. The worrying thing if you’re a Colts fan, I think, is that this is the sort of game where the breaks went the Colts’ way and they still lost. If you were looking back at those four brutal losses to piece together a script of how the Colts could beat the Patriots, this is the sort of game you would have imagined. Indy scored on all three of its trips to the red zone and didn’t turn the ball over. It actually won the turnover battle and picked up a defensive touchdown, with Mike Adams grabbing the ball off Julian Edelman’s bobble and returning it for a pick-six. The Colts held Rob Gronkowski to just 50 yards and weren’t beaten to pieces by the Patriots running game, which ran for a still-impressive 116 yards on 25 carries. Instead, the Colts were beaten by the steady efficiency of the Patriots. The Indy game plan was to play zone coverage over the top, drop its linebackers deep to take away intermediate routes to Gronk, and hope it could get pressure without blitzing. The Colts blitzed on just 20.5 percent of Brady’s dropbacks, down from their season-long rate of 32.3 percent before Sunday night. It seemed like a logical plan, especially after the Patriots lost fill-in left tackle Marcus Cannon to a toe injury on the opening drive, but it didn’t work. The Colts sacked Brady just twice on 39 dropbacks, pressuring him a mere nine times. Brady was able to throw a seemingly endless stream of shallow crosses to Edelman and Danny Amendola, with the former Rams starter producing his first 100-yard game since 2013. If you want to consider blowing things up in Indianapolis and firing Pagano and/or general manager Ryan Grigson, that — not the Snapfu — should be the argument you pursue. Pagano, the former Ravens defensive coordinator, has put together excellent game plans for big wins (notably the victory over the 49ers in 2013 and last season’s playoff triumph over the Broncos), but he simply doesn’t seem to have any answer for how to stop the Patriots. And he is not getting much help from Grigson, who has failed to solve the pass-rush problem. Grigson inherited Robert Mathis, who still isn’t anything resembling his former self after rupturing his Achilles last offseason and undergoing 10 surgeries. The players Grigson acquired to aid in the pass rush have been disasters: 2013 first-rounder Bjoern Werner was inactive last night, as he was in last season’s AFC Championship Game against this same team. And offseason free-agent acquisition Trent Cole has been anonymous, with zero sacks and just one quarterback hit through five games in Indy. It wasn’t the sort of statement win most Patriots fans were hoping for after an offseason of barbs, but it was a comfortable victory for a team that has now won 18 of its last 19 competitive games.4 The schedule also opens up for the Patriots, who will now get three consecutive home games against the Jets, Dolphins, and Washington before traveling to face a more irritating past nemesis, the Giants. The comparisons to the 2007 team are still too aggressive, but the Patriots have a 2.8 percent chance of going 16-0. Win out on this upcoming homestand and those chances nearly double to 5.3 percent. At the very least, given how the Broncos are narrowly holding on to desperate victories in a way that doesn’t seem remotely sustainable, it seems like the Patriots are in a two-team race with the Bengals for the top seed in the AFC. It was easy to discount Carolina heading into Sunday’s game. Sure, the Panthers started 4-0, but that was against teams who were a combined 5-15. Things were going to be different in Seattle, especially after pranksters pulled the fire alarm at Carolina’s hotel early Sunday morning.5 This was going to be the game that proved the Panthers were mere interlopers, and the game that got the Seahawks back on track. And then it wasn’t. While Colts-Patriots got attention as a game between two bitter rivals where one team was desperately trying to break the story being told by its prior losses, Panthers-Seahawks wasn’t that much different of a narrative. The change here was that the losing team actually managed to overcome the story and win this time around. The fourth quarter had been the source of nightmares for the Panthers against Seattle; this time, it was their salvation. Before Sunday, Cam Newton had faced Russell Wilson four times, losing in each of those contests — including three one-score losses during the regular season. The Panthers had blown fourth-quarter leads in two of those games and come up short on a fourth-and-goal try from the 1-yard line that would have given them a lead in the fourth quarter of the third game. The fourth contest was a 14-point playoff loss that was still in doubt with 6:11 to go, when Newton could have made it a one-score game but instead threw a 90-yard pick-six to Kam Chancellor. This time things went the opposite way. The Seahawks started off the fourth quarter with a bang, with Wilson improvising on the run and finding Jimmy Graham for a 45-yard completion up the sideline before Marshawn Lynch broke through a tackle for 17 yards. The Seahawks were up 20-14 with the ball on the 16-yard line and could have busted the game open with a touchdown, but Lynch was stuffed twice before a big blitz took Wilson down for a sack on third down. The Seahawks went up nine with a field goal, but that wasn’t going to be enough. The teams traded punts before the Panthers picked an unlikely target to move the football against: Richard Sherman. Devin Funchess started the drive with a drop on a dig route against Sherman, but the Panthers marched down the field with throws to Cary Williams’s side before making their way back toward the star Seattle cornerback. Funchess caught a curl route for 8 yards against Sherman to move the chains, and on the next play, Newton fit a ball into an impossibly tight window past Sherman on a dig route to Greg Olsen, who took the ball 32 yards to the 1-yard line before a Jonathan Stewart plunge. The coverage wasn’t by any means bad, but it was an inch-perfect throw in a critical situation. A missed extra point from Graham Gano kept the game at 23-20, and if it was easy for Seahawks fans to feel the game slipping away, they had to be heartened by their next play from scrimmage. There was no conservative approach from embattled offensive coordinator Darrell Bevell, as the Seahawks went with an empty backfield and Wilson scrambled to find Graham for a 20-yard completion. It was Graham’s final catch on an eight-reception, 140-yard day. After that, dismal pass blocking sank the Seahawks. Lynch was called for holding on Shaq Thompson, with Wilson spinning into the pressure to force the hold. Then, Wilson was forced to scramble and throw the ball away on first down by pressure around both edges. A second-down screen saw Wilson under such heavy pressure by Kyle Love up the A-gap that he had to throw the ball at an awkward angle in desperation, allowing Carolina’s defenders to chase past Seattle’s ineffective linemen and take down Lynch for no gain. And Wilson was forced to scramble on third down by backup Carolina lineman Ryan Delaire, who beat Russell Okung, with Kawann Short cleaning up for one of his two sacks. The Seahawks were forced to punt, and their truly dismal offensive line was to blame. The Seahawks still could have won with a stop, or at least forced overtime by holding Carolina to a field goal, but Newton was not to be denied, not in this fourth quarter. Seattle slowed Carolina’s march when Bruce Irvin sacked Newton, pushing the Panthers back to Seattle’s 49-yard line and second-and-19, but the Panthers kept going. With star middle linebacker Bobby Wagner inactive because of injury, Newton steered backup Kevin Pierre-Louis away from Funchess’s dig route to get 16 yards before throwing a dart to Jerricho Cotchery on a third-and-3 slant to move the chains. That was enough to get the ball into Gano’s field goal range. This is the exact spot where coaches who struggle with game strategy make mistakes. Down three, vaguely inside their kicker’s range, and afraid of a game-sealing giveaway, they get hyper-conservative and settle for tricky field goal attempts that would only leave them heading into overtime. John Fox or Mike McCoy would have happily bunkered down and settled for a 44-yard Gano field goal to tie the game at 23. Ron Rivera is no such coach. After a Newton spike, he dialed up a game-winning touchdown pass that was aided by a disastrous blown coverage at exactly the wrong time. The Seahawks apparently intended to run their “L.A.” coverage look, which is their equivalent of the Tampa 2 with two deep safeties. For some reason, however, two different calls went into the huddle, leaving Sherman playing as a Cover 2 corner and Earl Thomas playing a shallower hook zone like the Seahawks were in Cover 3. The result was Olsen running right by Thomas and Sherman for one of the easiest game-winning touchdowns you’ll ever see:  It spoiled what had been an incredible game from Thomas, who broke up four passes and had an interception in the first quarter. It also raises more questions about a struggling Seahawks defense that is the miraculous Kam Chancellor forced fumble (and subsequent uncalled illegal batting) away from having blown three fourth-quarter leads in three weeks. It’s one thing for miscommunication to happen when Chancellor is holding out, or another for Williams to get beat. To see these sort of miscommunication issues occur late in games and have it bring down players like Sherman and Thomas? That has to be disheartening if you’re a Seahawks fan. As much as this team missed Chancellor in September and missed Wagner on Sunday, it feels like it also misses departed defensive coordinator Dan Quinn right about now. That shouldn’t take credit away from Newton and the Panthers, who improved to 5-0. The numbers aren’t pretty for Newton, who is completing just 55.4 percent of his passes and averaging an underwhelming 6.9 yards per attempt, but he’s been lethal late in the game. Newton’s QBR over the first three quarters is a mediocre 37.1, which is good for 30th among qualifying passers, but he heats up in the fourth quarter. After the Seahawks game, his fourth-quarter QBR is 94.1, the league’s second-best figure. And the Panthers now get a three-game homestand of their own, albeit against possibly stiff competition in the Eagles, Colts, and Packers. Carolina is in first place in the NFC South (after Atlanta lost to New Orleans on Thursday night), and it has an 89.9 percent chance of making the playoffs for the third consecutive season, per ESPN’s Football Power Index. And after slipping into the postseason at 7-8-1 last year, the Panthers are projected to finish 11-5. Sure, their schedule might be easier, but other teams have easy schedules and aren’t undefeated. And after the Panthers conquered their nemesis on Sunday, you can’t just wave them off any longer. It looked like the Steelers were going to be sunk after Ben Roethlisberger went down with a knee injury against the Rams in Week 3, but an unlikely hero has risen in Pittsburgh. No, it’s not Michael Vick, who has mostly been useless and left Sunday’s game with a hamstring injury. You could say it’s Landry Jones, who led the Steelers to a win over the Cardinals as Vick’s replacement, but even he was only part of the solution, given how much of his work came down to a pair of spectacular plays by Martavis Bryant. The surprise, instead, is the much-maligned Pittsburgh defense, which might very well have saved the Steelers’ season. A group that was 30th in DVOA last season was up to 15th before Sunday’s game, and they’ll rise even further in the rankings this week. They held a Cardinals offense that had been averaging 32.2 points per game (38 if you include return scores) to just 13 points on 11 meaningful possessions. The Cardinals scored their lone touchdown after taking over on the Pittsburgh 47-yard line; Arizona’s 10 possessions that began on their own side of the field produced a total of two field goals. How did the Steelers pull that off? There isn’t one obvious smoking gun, but it starts with what is quickly becoming one of the league’s best run defenses. Despite missing promising inside linebacker Ryan Shazier for the fourth straight game with a shoulder injury, the Steelers headed into the Cardinals game with the league’s fifth-best rush defense DVOA. They promptly bottled up Chris Johnson & Co., holding the Cardinals to just 55 rushing yards on 20 attempts. The Cardinals also played undisciplined football, especially on offense, which wiped away big plays. A Johnson chop block wiped away a 16-yard completion. Michael Floyd shoved his way to a touchdown catch that was called back. A Jared Veldheer hold negated what would have been a long pass interference penalty on Ross Cockrell. An offside call on Kareem Martin took away an interception by Patrick Peterson (to be fair, Vick probably realized it was a free play). The Cardinals threw in two unnecessary-roughness penalties and finished with nine flags for 111 yards. Arizona still made big plays — Palmer completed four passes of 30 yards or more — but the Steelers were able to hold up in the red zone after struggling there before Sunday. Pittsburgh headed into Week 6 allowing 5.3 points per red zone trip, the ninth-worst rate in football. The Cardinals, meanwhile, had been averaging 6.1 points per red zone possession, with 17 touchdowns in 22 trips inside the 20. That was the second-best rate in the league. History would have suggested that the Cardinals would march into the red zone and punch the ball into the end zone, but history was wrong. The Cardinals took four trips inside the 20 and came away with 13 points, an average of just 3.3 points per trip. That doesn’t include Palmer’s game-sealing interception in the end zone on a play from the Pittsburgh 20-yard line or the opening drive of the game, which made it to the 25 before ending in a punt after an aborted snap and Bobby Massie personal foul. The Cardinals typically make teams pay, but they couldn’t do that to the Steelers. While Pittsburgh was able to sack Palmer once and knock him down seven times, including a three-hit, two-TFL day from Cameron Heyward, the oft-belittled secondary deserves credit for making plays against one of the league’s best receiving corps. Pittsburgh knocked away eight passes and picked Palmer off twice, although the game-sealing interception by Mike Mitchell was on a truly inexplicable decision from Palmer. Emerging star wideout John Brown still had his way with Cockrell and Antwon Blake en route to a 10-catch, 196-yard day, and Palmer finished with 421 passing yards, but the Steelers were able to come up with plays when they needed them. Sometimes, it’s just that simple. Hold up against the run, slow down the offense in the red zone, and pick up a couple of takeaways, and all the yards in the world aren’t really going to matter. The Vick experiment thankfully seems over, given that he picked up none of his seven third-down opportunities and finished the game just 3-of-8 for 6 yards. Roethlisberger might be back for Sunday’s game at struggling Kansas City, but if he isn’t ready to return, the Steelers would probably turn to Jones, who went 8-of-12 for 168 yards and two scores while resembling a functional NFL quarterback in a way that Vick simply doesn’t at age 35. They’ll be down another starter on their offensive line after left tackle Kelvin Beachum suffered a season-ending torn ACL. He was replaced by 6-foot-9 Alejandro Villanueva, an Army Ranger who played multiple positions in college and tried out as a tight end and defensive lineman for the Bengals and Eagles, respectively, before catching on as a tackle with the Steelers. He’s unquestionably a badass, but he’s also a very inexperienced 27-year-old rookie who will be entrusted with protecting Pittsburgh’s quarterbacks in the months to come. The Steelers were paper-thin heading into the season, and they are realizing their biggest fears on the offensive side of the ball. In any case, the Steelers have managed to stay in the AFC playoff picture in a way that would have been hard to imagine while Roethlisberger was on the turf in St. Louis. The defense held on in that game for a 12-6 win and hasn’t looked back; Pittsburgh is a pair of missed Josh Scobee field goals away from going undefeated during Roethlisberger’s absence, allowing just 18.7 points per game in the process. Per FPI, the Steelers have a 73.6 percent chance of making the playoffs, and they even have a 26.5 percent chance of winning the AFC North. They’ll play the Bengals in Week 8 in a game that could matter a great deal in deciding the division.",2015-10-19T09:10:06+00:00,NFL,Barnwell
53,Week 5 Takeaways: Separation Anxiety,"The same old Bengals appear to have learned some new tricks. Unsurprisingly derided after falling behind 24-7 to the Seahawks at home during the third quarter, Cincinnati launched into a stirring comeback and scored 20 unanswered points, eventually using a Mike Nugent field goal off the left upright to come away with a 27-24 victory in overtime. It was a remarkable comeback for a team that had about a 3 percent chance of winning when it took over on offense down 17 points with 2:03 to go in the third quarter. Then again, ESPN’s Football Power Index suggests the Bengals had a 3.4 percent chance of starting the year 5-0, and here we are. Most of the immediate commentary after the game seemed to suggest that the Seahawks blew this lead, that it was more about the mistakes Seattle made than the good work done by Cincinnati to fuel the comeback. Offensive coordinator Darrell Bevell seemed to come in for specific criticism about his game plan, with Seattle fans feeling like the Seahawks hadn’t done enough to try to add to their lead, a sore spot given that the Seahawks nearly blew a narrow lead against the Lions last week and couldn’t hold a 10-point lead while going scoreless in the fourth quarter of the Super Bowl. I’m not so sure. The evidence that the Seahawks can’t hold a lead during the Russell Wilson era doesn’t seem to track. Since Wilson arrived in 2012, the Seahawks are 16-0 when they hold a 10-point lead at halftime. They’re 20-2 (.909) with a 10-point lead at the end of the third quarter, having lost the Super Bowl and Sunday’s game. The rest of the league is 375-31-2 (.922) over that same time frame.1 The Seahawks might be haunted by two very recent games gone awry, but they haven’t been appreciably worse at holding leads than the rest of the NFL. After going up 24-7 when Bobby Wagner recovered a fumbled Rex Burkhead end around and took it to the house, the Seahawks started their next drive on their own 2-yard line. It would be the first of four possessions they would have before the Bengals tied the game at the end of regulation, each of which would start with subpar field position. The Seahawks didn’t start a single one of those drives with fewer than 80 yards to go for a touchdown, which didn’t help matters. I went back and watched those four drives to see (admittedly with the benefit of hindsight) if the Seahawks were too conservative. It’s hard for me to say they were. I think you could make a case that Bevell’s play calling was too predictable, given that he went run-run-pass on two of Seattle’s last three possessions. Predictable doesn’t necessarily have to be ineffective, though, and Seattle had enough success running the football that the play calls weren’t really the problem. The problem was a 280-pound defensive end who the Seahawks would have literally needed a 12th man to block. Carlos Dunlap was an absolute monster during those final four drives and either directly or indirectly resulted in each of their respective demises. He whipped the brutally overmatched Garry Gilliam on third-and-3 for a sack to end the first drive. He beat Gilliam again on the next third-and-4, knocking Wilson down while forcing the quarterback into a premature, inaccurate failed bomb to Jermaine Kearse. On the next drive, the Seahawks slid to account for a Bengals blitz and ended up with inexperienced running back Thomas Rawls matched up versus Dunlap, which ended poorly; Rawls was barely able to cut Dunlap for a moment, which only gave Wilson enough time to spin frantically under pressure from Dunlap, fall down, and deliver an incomplete pass as he was about to be laid out by George Iloka. And on third down during the final Seahawks drive in regulation, needing a stop, Dunlap feigned rushing outside and then cut inside to spy Wilson just as the Seattle star broke upfield to try to scramble for a first down. Geno Atkins came off of his man to sack Wilson for no gain, narrowly beating Dunlap to the punch. This is what a conservative offense looks like:  It wasn’t easy for Seattle on those final four drives. Rawls actually did a very effective job as a runner, given that there was penetration into the backfield from Cincinnati’s defensive line or free run blitzers on just about every play. Seattle did take a shot downfield on the first of those four possessions and nearly came away with a big play when Tyler Lockett badly burned Dre Kirkpatrick, but Wilson’s throw carried Lockett to the boundary, and the rookie wasn’t able to get his feet inbounds or draw a pass interference call on the desperate Kirkpatrick, with his 37-yard reception overturned on replay. The Bengals obviously deserve credit for eventually winning the game with what they did on offense, as well, and a lot of that goes on the shoulders of Andy Dalton, who brought the Bengals back even though his offensive line was outplayed by Seattle’s front four for most of the day. Even during that 17-point comeback in the fourth quarter, Dalton was routinely getting popped by free defenders. He even called his own number to set up the second touchdown, recognizing that the Seahawks didn’t have any linebackers in the box, sneaking in from 5 yards out to make it 24-21. That’s the sort of play we normally use to anoint Tom Brady as a mystical football genius, and he very well might be, but Dalton deserves a lot of credit for what he did, too. In fact, he had a lot in common with Brady on this day. You know what else Brady does? Drop 25-yard passes into a teacup for his uncoverable tight end, and that’s what Dalton did during that fourth quarter:  You may also notice the safety in coverage there, somebody Brady was able to pick on during the Super Bowl. Kam Chancellor won the game for the Seahawks last week, and he’s unquestionably a great player, but the Bengals worked him in the passing game on Sunday. There was that gorgeous pass from Dalton, a play where he’s clearly targeting Tyler Eifert vs. Chancellor in one-on-one coverage and trusting that his tight end is the better player. Eifert caught two touchdowns Sunday, and they came on virtually identical passes. Both times, Eifert ran past Chancellor, who failed to carry the burgeoning star up the seam long enough to provide meaningful support, producing easy touchdown passes and arguments among Seattle defensive backs:  Earl Thomas is going to be a Hall of Famer, but he can’t cover the entire end zone by himself, as he’s likely shouting at the end of that play. The Bengals also attacked Chancellor in those intermediate zones repeatedly during their last touchdown drive, including a three-pass sequence where they went at him three times in a row with Marvin Jones and Mohamed Sanu for a total of 40 yards and two first downs. It shouldn’t serve to take anything away from Chancellor and what he did last week (or his impact on the Seattle defense), but the Bengals unquestionably had success throwing at him on Sunday. They had even more fun throwing at Cary Williams, who is quickly becoming a notable problem at cornerback. It was easier to hide Williams’s struggles behind the Chancellor holdout, but after some painful moments during the first four weeks, Williams was desperately exposed during Sunday’s game. The Seahawks have spent the vast majority of the year in their traditional alignment, leaving Richard Sherman on his preferred left side of the field (on the right side of the offense) and Williams on the right. Just as the Patriots spent the entire Super Bowl keeping their best receivers away from Sherman, Bengals offensive coordinator Hue Jackson made the wise decision to leave A.J. Green on Williams’s side of the field to start the game. It wasn’t pretty. After a blown coverage on Sherman’s side versus the same switch verticals concept the Broncos ran for big plays against the Seahawks last year produced a 44-yard gain for Marvin Jones,2 the first of two aforementioned Eifert touchdowns put Cincy up 7-0. The next drive was a bridge too far. Green beat Williams at the line of scrimmage and caught a fade for an easy 22-yard completion on first-and-15. On the next play, he absolutely eviscerated Williams, leaving him in his dust and shedding him for a 72-yard touchdown catch on another fade, only for the play to be called back for a hold by star tackle Andrew Whitworth. After that series, defensive coordinator Kris Richard finally capitulated and moved Sherman to Green’s side of the field to shadow Cincinnati’s superstar wideout. It wasn’t exactly a one-on-one matchup for the rest of the day, as Cincinnati moved Green around and snuck him into the slot, but there was far more of Sherman on Green than the Bengals would have hoped. Eventually, they went after Williams with their secondary receivers and got pass interference penalties of 27 and 29 yards, including one that preceded the Eifert deep corner over Chancellor as part of the game-tying drive. For all of that, though, Dalton had to make the throws. He did throw an ugly interception in the end zone on a pass that was far too late, but otherwise, he was mostly brilliant. This won’t count as a prime-time game when you split up Dalton’s numbers to prove that he can’t win games when his team really needs him to, but games like this against dominant defenses should prove that he can produce big games when his team needs him to do so. I don’t really believe in statement games or games where a quarterback turns the corner and becomes a different passer afterward, but if you do, this was one of those games. As much as the Seahawks blew this lead, it was more about the likes of Dalton and Dunlap winning it for the increasingly impressive Bengals. Gregory Shamus/Getty Images There are some who would love it to be 2008 all over again. Shia LaBeouf. Lil Wayne. Myspace. The Detroit Lions are not on that list, but on Sunday, it felt a little bit like 2008 at Ford Field. The Lions were already one of the league’s more disappointing teams after following their playoff run with an 0-4 start to the 2015 season, but they hadn’t delivered the sort of embarrassing performance that marked their winless campaign seven years ago. That’s no longer the case, as the Lions turned the ball over six times and benched starting quarterback Matthew Stafford during a 42-17 loss to the Cardinals. Even that disastrous Lions team under Rod Marinelli might have struggled to come up with a first-half stinker as bad as what Detroit mustered up on Sunday. Although surely aided by a Cardinals team that seems to absolutely relish its chances to annihilate the league’s lesser lights, the Lions turned the ball over four times during a sputtering first half. The 2008 Lions never did that. It happened only three times during the 2014 campaign, and truthfully, the Lions should have had a fifth first-half giveaway on an Ameer Abdullah fumble, only for the Cardinals — who should have had enough practice by now — to narrowly recover the fumble out of bounds. The Lions benched Abdullah after that fumble, his second of the day, and Stafford followed shortly thereafter. Head coach Jim Caldwell warned Stafford that he would be benched if he threw another interception after halftime, and not wanting to waste much time, Stafford threw a pick on fourth-and-3 when he tried to force a ball to Calvin Johnson on the opening possession of the second half. True to his word, Caldwell brought in Dan Orlovsky, who added another pick in his 38 pass attempts. Caldwell said after the game that he has no intention of making a long-term quarterback change, and there’s little reason to think Orlovsky would be any better than Detroit’s incumbent, but Stafford has been a problem this year. Stafford has never been the most careful of quarterbacks, but after posting a career-low interception rate of 2.0 percent during his first season under Caldwell in 2014,3 the hope was that he would be more careful with the football. That hasn’t been the case; after throwing 12 picks in 16 games last year, he’s already thrown eight interceptions during Detroit’s first five contests in 2015. His interception rate is up in the Kirk Cousins range at 4.1 percent. The biggest drop-off for Stafford, statistically, has been on intermediate throws traveling between 10 and 20 yards in the air. The famously big-armed passer always has the ability to make plays downfield, but the Lions have typically capitalized on that by exploiting teams’ fear of getting beat for those big plays with steady doses of dig routes and back-shoulder throws. Last year, Stafford was effective on those passes, producing an 85.7 QBR while throwing five picks on 138 tries. In 2015, Stafford has been awful in that same range, posting a lowly 31.7 QBR, good for 32nd in the NFL. He’s already thrown five interceptions in that range on just 42 attempts. What’s weird for a quarterback with Stafford’s arm strength is that he is simply not getting the ball downfield very frequently. He’s averaging 6.12 air yards per attempt, which is 32nd among quarterbacks this year. Only Philip Rivers, Tony Romo, and Alex Smith are averaging fewer air yards per attempt. Last year, Stafford averaged 7.80 yards per attempt, which was just below the league average of 8.12 air yards per throw. It’s fair to say that part of the game plan from embattled offensive coordinator Joe Lombardi has been designed to get the ball out of Stafford’s hands and away from his disappointing offensive line, which hasn’t coalesced at all. The Cardinals knocked down Stafford and Orlovsky 11 times on 71 dropbacks. Veteran center Dominic Raiola had slipped by the end of his final season last year, but replacement Travis Swanson has been a mess this season. The Lions may very well want to move left guard Manny Ramirez to center and slot first-round pick Laken Tomlinson in at guard, but Ramirez has been forced to fill in on the right side while star guard Larry Warford has struggled with a high ankle sprain. Warford missed the Cardinals game after re-aggravating the ankle injury two weeks ago. Injuries, indeed, are the biggest reason the Lions have been so bad this season. There are other disappointing teams that can claim to be affected by injuries to their star players — the Cowboys, Steelers, and Ravens come to mind — but nobody in the league has been decimated by injuries quite like the Lions have. The list is actually quite staggering: The Lions must have been thrilled to get Levy back this week, but his return to the lineup only lasted a handful of snaps before he re-aggravated his hip ailment and left the game. His status going forward is unknown. The one unit of the team that has remained healthy has been the secondary, but that has been a disaster. Darius Slay has been toasted for big plays each of the past three weeks, with John Brown getting him for a 49-yard gain up the sideline on Sunday. Rashean Mathis is beginning to look his age; the Cardinals were able to hit a big running play when Mathis went missing in coverage. Third-round selection Alex Carter, who was supposed to offer depth at cornerback, is on short-term injured reserve with an ankle injury and won’t be back until Week 10 at the earliest. It’s fair to say that the most disconcerting performance might be from one of the few Lions actually healthier than he was a year ago. Lions fans likely dreamt that the Detroit passing attack would include the Golden Tate who broke out in 2014 along with the 2011 to 2013 version of Calvin Johnson, who averaged 111.7 receiving yards per game over that three-year stretch. Throw in Abdullah, a preseason sensation, and it seemed like Detroit could piece together a top-five passing attack if everyone stayed on the field in 2015. Megatron hasn’t missed any time, but he doesn’t look like the world-destroyer from the past. He was held to five catches for 64 yards on seven targets by resurgent Cardinals cornerback Patrick Peterson on Sunday, with Tate being targeted 18 times on the other side of the field. He has faced a murderers’ row of cornerbacks over the past three weeks with Peterson, Sherman, and Denver’s Aqib Talib/Chris Harris Jr. combination, but this is Calvin freaking Johnson. He’s supposed to be the one who gives cornerbacks bad matchups, not the other way around. Through five games, Johnson has caught 32 passes on 52 targets for 322 yards. That yardage total is what really concerns me. Remove passes that travel fewer than five yards in the air from the equation (in other words, no screens), and Johnson is averaging 2.6 yards after the catch. The only wide receivers with 15 such catches averaging fewer YAC on those throws are DeAndre Hopkins (who is probably exhausted from all the targets), Michael Crabtree, and Allen Robinson. On those same throws from 2011 to 2013, Johnson averaged 4.5 yards after catch. Stafford has always been the sort of quarterback comfortable throwing his receivers into big hits; it’s scary to wonder whether Johnson, who turned 30 several weeks ago, has been permanently slowed by them. And really, if Stafford and Megatron aren’t playing like superstars, this team is going to struggle. The Lions have two of the eight highest cap hits in the league, with Stafford making $17.7 million and Johnson in line for a whopping $20.6 million. The Lions are also responsible for $9.7 million in dead money from Ndamukong Suh’s deal. The trio counts for $48 million, which is just under one-third of Detroit’s entire cap space. The Lions can’t do much about Suh, and they may not regret missing out on Suh’s massive deal, but they clearly chose to build around the offensive components of their big three. If Stafford is subpar and Johnson is simply a pretty good wideout, the Lions are toast, and that’s before considering the injuries elsewhere. 2016 is the first year the Lions can seriously consider moving on from either of their stars. They would save $11.5 million on their cap by cutting or trading Stafford, although they would still owe him $11 million in dead money. It would be a similar figure to dump Johnson, whose contract remains onerous. His cap hold will come in just over $8 million more next year ($24.0 million) than the second-most expensive wideout (Julio Jones, $15.9 million). I don’t think the Lions should try to get rid of Stafford or Johnson with no clear path to a replacement, but as currently constructed, they’re in trouble. If their stars are struggling for adequacy and the rest of their roster is riddled by injuries, they’re going to be really bad. That’s why I wouldn’t endorse making major moves. As much as Caldwell and Lombardi are easy to blame for the team’s problems, they don’t run the cap. And if they replace longtime general manager Martin Mayhew this offseason, whoever comes in for Mayhew will need two years to rebuild the roster and reconfigure the team’s salary structure. The Lions are a massive runaway train that will be virtually impossible to steer back onto the tracks quickly unless the brakes suddenly come back to life. And right now, the only thing they’re running away with is last place in the NFC North. Frederick Breedon/Getty Images The 2015 Titans aren’t exactly in win-now mode, but they shouldn’t be in the business of giving victories away, either. That’s what they did Sunday, blowing a brilliant defensive performance and a 10-0 third-quarter lead to lose 14-13 to a Bills team they outplayed for most of the day. It’s a loss you can pin at least in part on Ken Whisenhunt, who spent the vast majority of the game coaching not to lose. His conservative decision-making ended up costing the Titans the points that served as the margin of victory. In the abstract, you can understand why Whisenhunt would have been concerned about his team’s ability to win in the trenches in short-yardage situations against a dominant Bills defense. His offensive line was missing guard Chance Warmack and included a limited Taylor Lewan, who committed two penalties (another was declined) before leaving the game with a stinger. And indeed, Tennessee’s running backs had a tough time on the ground, combining for just 49 rushing yards on 22 attempts. What Whisenhunt does have is a mobile quarterback. Marcus Mariota is the perfect sort of quarterback to employ on fourth down, agile enough to slip through creases and an experienced operator with getting the ball out quickly for short, accurate passes. During his time at Oregon, Mariota posted a 90.8 QBR on fourth-down pass plays and converted on 11 of his 17 fourth-down rush attempts. Mariota probably isn’t the sort of fourth-down wrecking machine that Cam Newton is in Carolina, but he aids your chances dramatically. In any case, regardless of what he thought his team’s chances might be on fourth down, Whisenhunt coached like a man who had little faith in his offense. The Titans drove to the Buffalo 36-yard line on their opening drive, only for Whisenhunt to skip a fourth-and-2 attempt or a 54-yard field goal attempt from Ryan Succop in pleasant weather to punt, pinning the Bills on their 11-yard line. The Bills went three-and-out, as they would do for most of the first half; their five first-half drives produced a total of just 52 yards and four first downs. The Titans took over and again drove before stalling out on the Buffalo side of the field, this time punting on fourth-and-9 from the Buffalo 48, again to the 11-yard line. That’s reasonable: You can see the Titans wanting to play field position and force Tyrod Taylor to march downfield on their quietly impressive pass rush. After another punt, Tennessee broke through into the red zone and finally got into scoring position. Again, though, Whisenhunt played it safe. The Titans eventually faced a fourth-and-2 from the Buffalo 3-yard line and chose to kick a 21-yard field goal. It doesn’t seem to fit. The numbers narrowly say to go for it, but if Whisenhunt was playing field position, wouldn’t he have appreciated the value of locking the Bills inside their 5-yard line even after a failed conversion attempt? You’ll hear announcers and coaches blabber on about how important it is to take the lead and score the first points in a game, but a 3-0 lead almost never holds up. There have been 180 games in the post-merger NFL with a team leading 3-0 at halftime, as the Titans did Sunday. In just 27 of those 180 games (15 percent), the leading team has maintained its shutout through the second half. It was naive of Tennessee to expect the defense to shut the Bills out for the entire game. Whisenhunt kept going. He punted on fourth-and-7 from the Titans’ 45-yard line, and after another failed Bills drive combined with a 26-yard punt return, the Titans took over on the Buffalo side of the field. They moved the ball to the 39-yard line, and on yet another fourth-and-2, Whisenhunt again chose to look past the numbers and punt. Only one team, the Chiefs, punted even once during the first half on fourth-and-2 or less inside the opposition’s 40-yard line during the 2014 season. Whisenhunt’s Titans did it twice in one game! He finished up the half by handing the ball off to Dexter McCluster on a draw from the Tennessee 10-yard line with 10 seconds left. The Titans forced one more short possession after the break and then punched in a 1-yard touchdown by Antonio Andrews to go up 10-0. It looked like they had probably done enough to keep themselves ahead of a moribund Bills offense, but things suddenly clicked to life for the Bills against a tiring Tennessee front seven. Taylor began to break free, scrambling for 26 yards on one third down before taking a quarterback draw for a 22-yard score. Whisenhunt’s Titans responded with a drive that started on their own 5-yard line and took nearly seven minutes off the clock. It included a successful conversion on second-and-1 from Andrews, his second conversion on three 1-yard tries Sunday. And when the drive stalled on the Buffalo 23-yard line, Whisenhunt faced a fourth-and-2 and … kicked another field goal to go up 13-7 with 9:41 left. The New York Times‘s fourth-down bot liked that one, and it’s the most defensible conservative call Whisenhunt made all day. The head coach was betting on his defense to come through and prevent the Bills from scoring a second touchdown, but it didn’t work out that way. Taylor scrambled for 24 yards on third-and-23, with a 15-yard horse collar penalty tacked on for linebacker Zach Brown. Taylor then hit nominal no. 1 receiver Chris Hogan (with Sammy Watkins inactive with a calf injury) for 46 yards before finding Hogan on a quick out for the game-winning score. The Titans picked up one first down on their two ensuing drives, and even that required an absurd unnecessary roughness call on Corey Graham. Quite literally, Whisenhunt’s conservative decision-making cost his team the game. Chase Stuart noted on Twitter that Whisenhunt’s three decisions on fourth-and-2 cost his team 2.5 points versus the optimal decision, which would have been going for it in each case. Even allowing that the Titans would not have had quite as much success as an average team going for it in the same situations, there’s a comfortable gap between the 2.5-point difference and the single-point margin of victory in Tennessee. It’s a shame, too, because the Titans might actually have a shot at competing to win an even-more-moribund-than-usual AFC South. They’re in the middle of a homestand that will see them play the lowly Dolphins and the somehow-undefeated Falcons over the next two weeks before traveling to winnable road destinations in Houston and New Orleans. If Tennessee had managed to hold on to the lead against the Colts in Week 3 and beaten the Bills this week, it would have had serious playoff aspirations at the top of the South. Instead, just as was the case on Sunday, the Titans appeared to let opportunity slip through their grasp.",2015-10-12T10:17:07+00:00,NFL,Barnwell
54,Week 4 Wrap: The Haves vs. the Have Nots,"EDITOR’S NOTE: This piece was published before reports surfaced that the Dolphins had fired head coach Joe Philbin.  There are six undefeated teams in the NFL, and you can construct an easy story for four of them. The Patriots and Packers have the two best quarterbacks in football. The Broncos have the league’s best defense. And the Panthers have played the league’s easiest schedule. It’s a little tougher to piece together the story for the Falcons, who had won three close games before blowing out the Texans on Sunday; they’ve faced an easy schedule and gone up against a pair of backup quarterbacks. It’s even tougher to sum up why the Bengals have made it through the first quarter of the season without a blemish on their record. This isn’t to say that they don’t deserve a 4-0 record; Cincinnati has outscored its opposition by 11 points per game while going up against three playoff contenders and a Raiders team that’s been feistier than expected this year. Their story isn’t quite as obvious as the league’s other undefeated teams, but it doesn’t make the Bengals any less impressive or suggest that they’re suddenly about to fall from grace. With a 67 percent chance of winning the AFC North, Cincinnati may have already done enough to seal another run of meaningful football in January. The Bengals have a more subtle tale in play: It’s hard to find a team that has been more impressive on both sides of the line of scrimmage than Cincinnati. It’s always tough to gauge this, but through four weeks, the Bengals have had one of the best offensive lines in all of football. That’s not necessarily a surprise, given how well their stars — notably dominant left tackle Andrew Whitworth — played a year ago up front, but they’ve taken another step forward. Right tackle Andre Smith was a disaster in 2014 before going down with a torn triceps; he has returned and been reasonably effective. Center Russell Bodine, the other weak link from a year ago, has also improved. The impact of those improvements has been felt in Cincinnati’s performance. No line has been better in pass protection. Andy Dalton has been sacked only twice across four games, tied for the league-low mark with Ryan Fitzpatrick of the Jets. He has been pressured on just 13.5 percent of his dropbacks this season, which is the third-lowest rate in the league. Only Eli Manning and Derek Carr have felt less pressure, and as far as the Giants are concerned, that’s mostly been because teams have been dropping seven into coverage in the hopes of slowing Odell Beckham Jr.1 As has often been the case with Dalton, he’s a totally different quarterback when the Bengals keep defenders out of his face. During those rare times defenses have gotten pressure on Dalton this season, he has posted a 1.8 QBR, 28th in the league among quarterbacks when they’ve been pressured. When unmolested, Dalton is brilliant: His 97.6 QBR when unpressured is the best rate in football through four weeks. It’s no surprise that he torched the Chiefs for 321 yards on 24 pass attempts in a 36-21 win on Sunday. The same pass rush that lit up Tom Brady in this very week last season and stood out as one of the league’s best rushes for most of the season couldn’t get near Dalton yesterday. The Chiefs didn’t knock Dalton down even once amid those 26 dropbacks, and ESPN Stats & Information credited Justin Houston & Co. with only two pressures during a long, arduous afternoon. The Bengals have also been better about creating running lanes for the combination of Jeremy Hill and Gio Bernard. Last year, Cincinnati’s backs averaged 2.47 yards before contact by a defender, which was 20th among the league’s 32 teams. This year, with a larger dose of Bernard and steadier play up front, they’re averaging 2.97 yards before contact, which is the fifth-best rate in the league. That figure, too, was up to snuff on Sunday: The Bengals averaged 3.69 yards before contact, topped in Week 4 by only the Broncos and the Rams. By avoiding sacks and negative plays, the Bengals have been way ahead of schedule on offense. They’re averaging 7.4 yards per first-down play this year, which is the best in the league by a comfortable margin. Nobody else is within a half-yard of them. And then, when they get to third down, they’re converting on 45.8 percent of their attempts, the fifth-best rate in the league. It’s obviously still early, but so far the Bengals are seeing the benefits of getting their personnel back on offense. The most notable returnee is emerging tight end Tyler Eifert, who missed virtually the entire 2014 season after dislocating his elbow during the season opener, one of many injuries that plagued Cincinnati last year. The Bengals posted the league’s fifth-highest Adjusted Games Lost (AGL) figure on offense in 2014, while this season they have virtually their entire offensive roster available. The only exception is first-rounder Cedric Ogbuehi, with the Texas A&M tackle basically spending 2015 as a redshirt year as he recovers from knee surgery before likely taking over for a departing Smith in 2016. It might be even more promising to see the Bengals return to form on defense. Last year was a disastrous campaign for the Cincinnati front four, which failed to come close to lofty expectations. Star defensive tackle Geno Atkins wasn’t the same guy after returning from a torn ACL, and a thin rotation at defensive end failed to get after the quarterback. The Bengals finished with fewer sacks (20) as a team than Justin Houston (22) had on his own. This year, with Michael Johnson returning after a year in the Tampa wilderness and Carlos Dunlap back to health, the Bengals are back to form. They beat Alex Smith and an underwhelming Chiefs offensive line into submission on Sunday, sacking Smith on five occasions and knocking him down 10 times on 55 dropbacks. They got another sack from Dunlap, who may finally be having the breakout season the Bengals have long envisioned. Having failed to make it over eight sacks since a 9.5-sack rookie season, Dunlap has 3.5 sacks in his first four games. Atkins, too, looks like the force who was dominating in 2012 and 2013. The Chiefs were able to move the ball with Jamaal Charles, but when they got to the red zone, Cincinnati’s defense tightened up. Cairo Santos kicked seven field goals on Sunday, as the Bengals held Kansas City to nine points across three trips to the red zone. And while Charles ran for 75 yards on 11 carries, the Bengals had been great against opposing rushers heading into this game, posting the league’s second-best rush defense DVOA through three weeks. This is all a very viable, sustainable plan for the Bengals, who have been built around their offensive and defensive lines and a deep, versatile secondary. Dre Kirkpatrick has finally made his way into the starting lineup ahead of Leon Hall without the Bengals skipping a beat. Darqueze Dennard, a 2014 first-rounder, struggled when taking his first snaps of the season in the stead of injured starter Adam Jones, but Jones should be back in time for Cincinnati’s Week 5 matchup with the Seahawks. With the Bengals, it always comes back to Dalton, and so this is a time to acknowledge how well he has played with an allowance for how it might fade. Dalton’s numbers to start the year — completing 67.2 percent of his passes while averaging 10.2 yards per attempt — have been ridiculous. He has produced 11.4 adjusted yards per attempt to start the season, the best four-game figure of his career by a significant margin. Dalton has posted a four-game average higher than nine yards per attempt only once, when he averaged 10.2 adjusted yards per attempt during a stretch in 2013. That run felt like a maturation point for Dalton; the Bengals went 4-0 during that period, including a memorable win over the Patriots in Cincinnati. As tempting as it was to pin it as a step forward, it wasn’t. Dalton immediately followed that by averaging 4.0 adjusted yards per attempt over his next four games, the second-worst four-game stretch of his career. He threw nine picks during that subsequent four-game run, even as the Bengals went 2-2. Cincinnati may have done enough during its hot start to seal up the North, but if the Bengals want to make a serious run in the AFC playoffs, it’ll be awfully important for Dalton to keep up his hot stretch over the second quarter of the 2015 campaign. Getty Images London was the site of a long-rumored administrative bloodletting on Sunday. Two of the Premier League’s 20 managers lost their jobs, with Sunderland’s Dick Advocaat quitting hours before the news broke of Brendan Rodgers’s dismissal by Liverpool. A third boss will be relieved that he wasn’t added to the list. Dolphins head coach Joe Philbin’s job appears to be on the chopping block after a dismal start to the season, and the calls for his head only grew after Miami joined most of the West Coast in sleeping through a brutal 27-14 shellacking by the Jets in England. If a head coach should be fired after four games, it’s fair to say that Philbin would be that coach. The loss to the Jets wasn’t exactly a one-off. Miami’s playoff aspirations are in tatters after a 1-3 start, one that has included consecutive division no-shows against the Bills and Jets. FiveThirtyEight’s simulation leaves the Dolphins with just a 5 percent chance of making the postseason when it was expected that Philbin needed to make the playoffs to save his job. So why shouldn’t the Dolphins fire their embattled head coach after lying down at Wembley? Well, what if it doesn’t make things any better? I’m not convinced that Philbin is doing much right for the Dolphins, but I’m also not convinced that firing him is going to solve the myriad problems with this football team, at least not at this point in the season. If anything, given how dysfunctional they appear to be, getting rid of the small amount of continuity the Dolphins have with their head coach might actually make things worse. When I wrote about the Dolphins during Brink Week this past August, I spelled out the concerns about how thin Miami was on defense and how important it was for the few stars the Dolphins had to stay healthy, given the incredible lack of depth behind them. It was a problem the Dolphins reinforced by clearing out cap space this offseason to sign superstar defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh, who promised to give Miami another All-Pro-caliber player but prevented it from signing multiple contributors to plug holes around the defense. Shortly after the article was published, Dolphins safety Louis Delmas tore his ACL, ending his season in August. It was the first in a series of problems. Delmas was replaced by Walt Aikens, who promptly became one of the worst regular defensive backs in the league in 2015. He has now ceded most of his playing time to special-teamer Michael Thomas, who played 96 defensive snaps last season. If you’ve never heard of these guys, it’s not a coincidence; this is what the back half of Miami’s roster looks like. Next, it was star pass-rusher Cameron Wake. Wake suffered a hamstring injury during the Week 1 win over Washington and hasn’t been the same player since, in terms of both workload and effectiveness. He has been a situational player ever since the injury and has yet to record a sack in 2015, with just one quarterback knockdown. As Wake’s effectiveness has gone missing, so has the concept of a Miami pass rush. The Dolphins have just one sack in four games (from Jordan Phillips), and Olivier Vernon is the only Dolphins defender to knock down a quarterback as frequently as two times this season. Suh, who had 8.5 sacks and 20 knockdowns last season, has just one hit in 2015. Teams have been able to double- and triple-team him all season without needing to be worried about Miami’s edge-rushers beating their tackles one-on-one. Without any sort of pass rush, defensive coordinator Kevin Coyle attempted to manufacture one against Fitzpatrick and the Jets on Sunday. He sent blitzers on only 30.3 percent of New York’s dropbacks on Sunday, and while that generated pressure, it failed to produce even a single sack. Despite this strategy, the Dolphins were still susceptible to power runs; see Chris Ivory’s 29-carry, 166-yard day for proof of that. Brent Grimes hasn’t been his usual self this season and was beaten by Brandon Marshall for a 58-yard gain on the opening drive, but even a disappointing Grimes would be Miami’s best cornerback by leaps and bounds. If he’s out for any length of time, the Dolphins would be running out one of the worst secondaries in recent memory after their upcoming bye. Miami is also a thin team on offense, and it’s having similar issues on that side of the football. The Dolphins badly miss left tackle Branden Albert, who has missed the past two games with a hamstring injury. Their guards have struggled mightily, especially right guard Jamil Douglas, a fourth-round project forced into action as a rookie. The line has exhibited serious communication issues that have led to blown protections, like the one that ended with Muhammad Wilkerson running free at Ryan Tannehill for a sack yesterday. And first-round pick DeVante Parker still isn’t right after foot surgery, having played just 59 snaps through three weeks before going targetless on Sunday. This is all a consequence of the way Miami built its roster under Jeff Ireland and subsequently under the current regime of general manager Dennis Hickey and football operations VP Mike Tannenbaum. The Dolphins have taken a stars-and-scrubs approach to their roster construction, a byproduct of their love for signing free agents and their struggles to draft well in years past. Right now, their stars are all injured or ineffective. It’s Philbin’s job to develop the few draft picks and journeymen he gets into worthwhile contributors, but he isn’t exactly getting to work with a series of Ted Thompson draft classes in Miami. The Dolphins can’t change their roster-building model overnight. They can start this offseason, but it won’t be easy, given that Suh’s cap hit jumps from $6.1 million to $28.6 million.2 They definitely can’t start here in October, given what little flexibility they have and what little there is to work with on any plausible trade market. They could inquire about out-of-favor players like Browns linebacker Barkevious Mingo or Buccaneers cornerback Alterraun Verner, but even those moves would take away valuable picks the Dolphins need to keep in order to draft cheap talent in the years to come. And with that roster so thin, what good is firing Philbin going to do right now? Whoever the Dolphins would bring in isn’t going to know the players Miami has or the schemes it’s been preparing with all season. The new coaches would be putting out fires and installing a vanilla game plan for the first few weeks; is there any reason to think Philbin can’t do that already? It’s unclear who would even be a logical successor to Philbin, given how the Dolphins have been struggling. There’s no obvious head-coaching candidate on staff, especially with offensive coordinator Bill Lazor struggling to piece together even a competent unit around Tannehill. The Dolphins can’t afford to erode their quarterback’s confidence, given how he’s signed to a deal that guarantees him significant new money next year. The game situations and struggles along the offensive line have led Lazor to virtually abandon the run, with Miami averaging a league-low 16.3 rush attempts per game. The struggles with the running game and an inability to keep Tannehill upright have left Miami’s offense in far too many third-and-longs, which it’s been expectedly unable to navigate. The Dolphins are converting just 26.9 percent of their third downs so far this year, the third-worst figure in the league. In midseason, it’s also virtually impossible to find someone who can revamp a team’s schemes the way the Dolphins need to. Tannenbaum can’t hire anybody off of an NFL staff in midseason, which eliminates many of the top viable candidates as a future Dolphins head coach. He can hire somebody who doesn’t currently have a job, but that person would be coming in as a lame-duck interim coach for a team riddled with injuries, out of depth, and without any ability to install a coaching staff or many new concepts. Does that sound like the sort of job that would entice a big-name coach? And if for some reason it did, why wouldn’t that coach wait until the end of the season to try to take over, when those sorts of personnel decisions are more likely to come with meaningful power? That leaves the Dolphins without any good options. Even if they think Philbin has no future or no hope of making the playoffs, there’s nobody Tannenbaum can hire today who would make them significantly better before 2016. And if that’s true, the only purpose a firing would serve would be to try to light a spark under the team, which might work over the next week or two without offering anything in the way of even a vaguely long-term solution and could very well set the team back even further. Instead, it’s more plausible that the Dolphins start making preparations for these moves in the days to come. They can’t really fire Philbin, but they can get a head start on the staff rebuilding project by firing defensive coordinator Kevin Coyle, whose unit has seemed a step slow and a moment behind virtually all season. There’s no obvious replacement for Coyle on staff, either, but it’s easier to envision a defensive position coach stepping up to coordinator than it is to imagine one of Miami’s assistants stepping right in as a head coach. The Dolphins are overloaded with problems, and Philbin is one of them, but getting rid of him isn’t inherently a solution, either. Getty Images Week 4 was brutal for kickers around the league. On Thursday, Steelers kicker Josh Scobee missed his two chances to seal Pittsburgh’s win over the Ravens. Scobee’s replacement in Jacksonville was Jason Myers, who missed two would-be game winners against Indianapolis before the Jaguars eventually fell, 16-13. San Diego’s Josh Lambo missed his game-winning attempt, only to be bailed out by a Browns offside penalty before hitting on the second try. Philly fill-in Caleb Sturgis pulled a 33-yarder and missed an extra point in what ended up as a three-point loss. Saints rookie Zach Hocker bounced a 30-yarder off the uprights to force overtime. And Tampa Bay’s Kyle Brindza has already missed six field goals and two extra points, including 29- and 43-yard attempts against the Panthers on Sunday. Scobee lost his job this weekend, and yet it wouldn’t be a surprise to see him replace one of the other kickers in that list above by the time Week 5 begins on Thursday. Kicking around the league sure feels like a mess, but when the solution is just to sign a place-kicker who’s available because he struggled in another situation last week, are things really going to get any better? What’s wrong with the league’s kickers in 2015? You won’t be surprised that we’re about to head to some numbers. During Week 4, kickers were 57-of-71 (80.3 percent). And so far in 2015, kickers are 198-for-237 on field goals. That’s an 83.5 percent conversion rate. Those figures are down from the cumulative performance produced by place-kickers in 2014, when the league’s specialists hit on 84.7 percent of their field goal attempts. That’s certainly a decline, but it’s not much of one. Kickers were actually worse through the first four weeks of the 2013 season, hitting on 82.7 percent of their field goal attempts. As recently as 2010, they were all the way down at 78.9 percent through those first four weeks. Our standards for kickers are a lot higher these days: 83.6 percent is the sixth-best cumulative performance through the first four weeks of the season since the merger in 1970. Let’s drill down a little further by comparing field goal rates from each traditional 10-yard range to the league’s conversion rate last year to see how many field goals kickers “should” have made given our expectations heading into the season: That isn’t a significant difference whatsoever. Kickers have missed more midrange field goals than we would have expected, but they’ve also been better on 50-plus-yard tries, making 23 of 33 when we would have expected them to hit on just 20.1 of those 33 tries. Take Brindza’s Week 3 as an example: He hit a 58-yarder and then missed from 41, 33, and 57 yards. The drop-off between last year’s kicker performance and this year’s group through four weeks amounts to a little less than one made field goal over the first month of the season. Kickers are not performing significantly worse than we should have expected so far in 2015. So, if kickers are basically cumulatively playing at about the level we would have expected heading into the season, why does it seem like they’ve been so awful? As far as I can tell, there are three reasons: 1. The disparity between the league’s best and worst kickers is larger than normal. There are plenty of kickers having great seasons so far this year. Josh Brown of the Giants is 10-for-10. Justin Tucker, who hit the game winner for Baltimore on Thursday night, is 10-for-11. Cairo Santos of the Chiefs is 10-for-11, too, including a 7-for-7 day against the Bengals on Sunday. Robbie Gould is 9-for-9. Steven Hauschka, Stephen Gostkowski, Sebastian Janikowski, Matt Bryant, Greg Zuerlein, and Dan Bailey are a combined 40-for-40. The league’s subpar kickers, though, have been struggling mightily. Brindza has already missed six field goals over four games; that’s more than 19 regular kickers missed over all of the 2014 season. Scobee missed four in four games, but he went 20-for-26 last year and missed seven over the previous three seasons combined. Adam Vinatieri has missed more field goals on five tries in 2015 (two) than he did on 31 attempts in 2014 (one). The true talent level of an unproven kicker like Brindza might be low, and Vinatieri isn’t going to hit more than 95 percent of his kicks with any level of regularity like he did last year, but these guys aren’t going to be as bad as they have been. 2. The missed kicks have come in meaningful, memorable situations. There have been 14 missed field goals so far in Week 4. Three of those kicks would have been game winners, and the two from Scobee were would-be game sealers that became important after the Ravens came back to win. And that number doesn’t include the Lambo miss that was wiped off the board. A disproportionate number of this week’s misses came in critical moments. There’s little reason to think that is meaningful or likely to reoccur. 3. We’re seeing more misses because of the new extra point rules. This, I think, is the biggest reason we’re down on kickers in 2015. They’re getting way more meaningful opportunities to have an impact on games because of the new extra point rules, and in our heads we’re treating all the misses as equally meaningful despite that not being the case. Include the 300 extra points attempted by kickers so far this season and we’ve seen 537 tries in four weeks. Last year, with extra points all but guaranteed, kickers attempted only 987 field goals all season. We’ve already seen what amounts to half a season of work during a typical year for the league’s kickers, and compressing that into a four-week span means that we’re naturally going to see more misses than our brains are used to seeing under the old rules. The league’s place-kickers have been right on schedule with those extra points from the 15-yard line. From 2010 to 2014, kickers were 144-for-153 (94.1 percent) on field goal tries from the 15-yard line. This year, they’re 283-for-300 on extra points, which is a conversion rate of 94.3 percent. That means we’ve seen a total of 56 missed kicks this season, way up from the 38 kicks (36 field goals and two extra points) that were missed over the first four weeks of the 2014 season. It’s no surprise that we’re seeing more missed kicks than we have in years past, but that’s because we’re seeing way more medium-range attempts by virtue of the change in the extra point rule. This is going to create an interesting market for how teams value those kickers going forward. History tells us that kicker accuracy is markedly inconsistent from year to year and subject to dramatic regression toward the mean, if only because the sample for each season was so remarkably small. Imagine judging baseball hitters by what they do in 30 at-bats over the course of a week; you’ll find that Mike Trout is probably better than Elvis Andrus most of the time, but that won’t always be the case. For kickers, that week of at-bats is an entire season of field goal attempts. Now, the sample of meaningful kicks will have more than doubled. We’ll get 70-80 attempts from most kickers if they stay healthy and play a full season, and that can change how teams value their talent. If the larger sample reveals that kicker talent is more homogeneous, it could cause organizations to treat kickers as far more fungible assets. On the other hand, if it allows the league’s top kickers to stand out even further and create a larger gap between the haves and the have nots, it could make the Gostkowskis and Baileys of the world even more money. So far, the story appears to be leaning in the latter direction. In any case, when it comes to kickers, there’s nothing unexpectedly wrong about their performance. This is just the NFL’s new normal.",2015-10-05T10:03:05+00:00,NFL,Barnwell
55,Your Comprehensive Week 4 NFL Picks,"It’s Underdog Week! I had the Ravens last night. OK. It’s Underdog Sunday! Jets (-1.5) over DOLPHINS Underdog Sunday in America … via London! Matt Ufford rightly wondered whether the Dolphins would Lane Kiffin Joe Philbin by leaving him at the airport in London if they lose Sunday. I’m not sure they should, but I am positive we should use Lane Kiffin as a verb for leaving someone at the airport from now on. Jaguars (+9) over COLTS Recency bias, but nine points seems like a lot for a team that hasn’t looked good for a single moment in 2015 and appears to have finally broken Andrew Luck. Texans (+6.5) over FALCONS The Falcons are 3-0 despite having led by more than seven points for 19 minutes during those three games. I don’t know that they’re a great team — Julio Jones and a few others aside — but there is also a reasonable chance they’ll end up running through the first half of their season without having played a quarterback any better than Marcus Mariota. It pays to be OK in the NFC South is what I’m saying. BUCCANEERS (+3) over Panthers Speak of the devil, the Panthers are 3-0 having beaten Blake Bortles, Ryan Mallett, and Luke McCown by a combined 23 points. After Jameis Winston this week and a bye, they get Russell Wilson, Andrew Luck, and Aaron Rodgers across a four-week span. That seems like it’ll be a problem, especially without Charles Johnson, who was placed on short-term injured reserve this week with a hamstring injury. Giants (+5) over BILLS A full list of the starting quarterbacks who have gone three games without throwing an interception: Aaron Rodgers, Tom Brady, Eli Manning. Comedy comes in threes! Interceptions too, sadly. BEARS (+3) over Raiders This is the second time the Raiders have been a road favorite in 10 seasons. They were two-point favorites against the Dolphins in 2012 during Ryan Tannehill’s second career start and lost by 22 points. The time before that was in 2005, when they had Marques Tuiasosopo at quarterback against Brooks Bollinger. It’s unfamiliar territory. WASHINGTON (+3) over Eagles This was the toughest test of my commitment to Underdog Sunday in America. Chiefs (+4) over BENGALS The debate over whether the Chiefs need to fundamentally change their offense to throw downfield seems odd, given that they won nine games in a tough division and were 12th in DVOA last year with Alex Smith throwing his passes a league-low 5.58 yards in the air per attempt. That was more than a full yard below next-to-last Blake Bortles. (Smith is last again this year, at 5.38 air yards per pass.) What the Chiefs need to do is not play the Packers in Lambeau every week. Browns (+7.5) over CHARGERS It’s unfair to judge the Chargers on how they played last week, given that they went down to five offensive linemen and lost their top two cornerbacks, but they’ve been underwhelming outside of one half against a Lions team that doesn’t appear to be very good. They’re 24th in DVOA and they might not have played a very tough schedule. They should beat the Browns, but 7.5 points seems like an awful lot. 49ERS (+8.5) over Packers Packers -2.5 and Chargers -1.5 is a classic sharp six-point teaser; since that isn’t in play for these bets, I’m going to count on a late 49ers touchdown from Colin Kaepernick in garbage time to cover. By the way: The only quarterback to throw more touchdowns in the first three games of a season without a pick than Aaron Rodgers (10) this year is Peyton Manning in 2013. Vikings (+6.5) over BRONCOS The Vikings absolutely flummoxed a struggling, injury-riddled Chargers offensive line with A-gap pressure last Sunday, knocking down poor Philip Rivers 11 times. They should be able to do the same thing to the Broncos. Then again, Minnesota’s offensive line hasn’t been much better, and DeMarcus Ware & Co. have gotten pressure on 39.1 percent of opposing dropbacks, the second-highest rate in the league. So, more than anything, just expect to see lots of grimacing quarterbacks and bubble screens in this game. Rams (+7) over CARDINALS The Cardinals have been incredible to start the season, but it’s also possible they’ve started the year against the three worst teams in the NFC. They’ve managed to go three games while holding the opposition to one sack of Carson Palmer; they may see star guard Mike Iupati make his debut this week, but if there were ever a matchup where the opposing pass rush was going to give Arizona’s downfield passing attack fits, it would be these Rams and their front four. SAINTS (-4) over Cowboys OK. Let’s settle it at Underdog Sunday Afternoon in America. This assumes Drew Brees will suit up at home for the Saints, because if he doesn’t, then it’s Luke McCown vs. Brandon Wee— nope, actually, this one won’t require Brees. SEAHAWKS (-10) over Lions How many consecutive shutouts would it take for Kam Chancellor to hold out again? Like, if the Seahawks shut out the Lions this week and blank Andy Dalton in Cincinnati next week and they go three games without allowing any points, shouldn’t Chancellor point out how much they’ve improved since he returned and hold out again? THIS WEEK: 0-0-1
LAST WEEK: 8-8

56,A Tale of Two Halves in Atlanta,"Two highly anticipated debuts occurred during the first game of Monday night’s doubleheader, and while many of us have been waiting to see what the new-look Eagles offense and Falcons defense would look like, what we saw was just about what any of us could have expected. Both personnel groups are flawed but fascinating, and their success both swung upon the power of the Atlanta pass rush. It was a late surge from the Atlanta defense that caused Chip Kelly to make a curious fourth-down decision, one that probably ended up costing his team the ballgame. The early returns on the Philadelphia offense, naturally, depend on which half of football you want to believe. The first half was an unmitigated disaster, as the Eagles seemed to disintegrate at the slightest touch without even vaguely resembling the dominant unit from the preseason. In the second half, against a gassed Atlanta defense, they looked virtually unstoppable, with Sam Bradford playing pitch-and-catch on a seemingly endless series of shallow crosses and wheel routes. Bradford was as advertised. The difference between the quarterback who struggled to make an impact during his time with the Rams and the guy who appeared to be throwing against air in the second half yesterday boiled down to the amount of time he had to throw. Under pressure more often than expected from Vic Beasley & Co. during the first half, Bradford wasn’t able to progress through his options and seemed to struggle with his accuracy. Once the rush slowed down after halftime, he was precise and in rhythm, going 21-of-25 for 219 yards with a touchdown and an unlucky, game-sealing interception that bounced off Jordan Matthews’s hands. Philly averaged 3.4 yards on first down before halftime and 8.0 yards on first down after the break. My concern about Bradford within the Kelly scheme has always been his struggles throwing deep and how important that’s been to the Philadelphia offense, but it didn’t really come up Monday. Bradford attempted a Week 1–high 52 passes but didn’t throw a single pass more than 20 yards downfield. His longest throw was a pass up the seam to a streaking Miles Austin that Jon Gruden identified on the broadcast as a possible touchdown if it had been completed, only for Austin to misjudge/drop the throw. Kelly’s solution to his team’s offensive struggles early last season was to up the dosage of Darren Sproles, and that salve worked again. The diminutive halfback was the team’s leading rusher and second-leading receiver, bringing in a team-high 15 touches while averaging 9 yards per touch. He became a matchup nightmare for Atlanta, which seemed to throw Kroy Biermann in Sproles’s direction in the hopes that the utility defender would figure out a way to suddenly get much faster. It didn’t work, and when the Falcons went to heavy zone coverage in an attempt to squeeze Philadelphia’s success throwing to the middle of the field, Sproles torched them on the edges. Last year, Sproles’s success came at the expense of LeSean McCoy, beginning a process that eventually led to the Eagles trading Shady to the Bills this offseason. Here, his reps came ahead of Philadelphia’s most notable offseason additions. While Sproles played only 24 snaps, those came at the expense of DeMarco Murray (31 snaps, less than half of Philadelphia’s total) and Ryan Mathews (13 snaps). Sproles out-touched Murray and Mathews during Philadelphia’s second-half comeback attempt. It makes sense that Kelly went to a heavier dose of Sproles; not only was he having more success than his more expensive brethren, but the Eagles virtually abandoned the running game. For a team that is supposed to be built around a power-running attack, the 2015 Eagles played a lot like some WIP caller’s nightmare of an Andy Reid dystopia. They threw the ball 52 times against just 16 running plays, and while some of that was due to the game situation of being down double-digits at the start of the second half, the truth is that Philadelphia’s running game simply wasn’t effective against 2014’s third-worst run defense. And when the rushing attack did get going, it was driven by Sproles, who had success running Philadelphia’s sweep and finished with five carries for 50 yards. Murray and Mathews combined for just 13 rushing yards on 11 carries. Mathews had an unfortunate drop in the first half before chipping in as a receiver after the break, but Murray never got going; his fantasy owners surely enjoyed two touchdowns, but he touched the ball 12 times and managed only 20 yards. Kelly abandoned the run, as Grantland’s Chris Brown noted on Twitter, because his offensive linemen were getting their asses handed to them. That has to be the most disconcerting part of Week 1 if you’re an Eagles fan. Beasley gave Jason Peters fits during a twitchy first half before Peters restored the order of the universe after halftime. The Eagles offense committed six holding penalties, admittedly in a game in which the referees needed to chill. The biggest problem with the line was how awful the guards looked, and in an offseason that seemed dedicated to reshaping the Eagles to run the football, it remains the most curious of Kelly’s decisions. It was one thing for Philadelphia to cut Evan Mathis and Todd Herremans from what had been the league’s best line in 2013; it was another to not obtain any replacement offensive linemen in free agency or the draft.1 The combination of Allen Barbre and Andrew Gardner, backups who were forced into the lineup by injuries last year, simply couldn’t hold up against Atlanta’s front four. It’s one thing for Peters to have a bad half; he’s earned the benefit of the doubt by now. It’s another for Barbre and Gardner to look totally ineffectual. There’s plenty more season to come, but it’s not a promising start for Philadelphia’s most obvious offensive weakness. Their issues may have ended up costing the Eagles the game. Down 26-24 with 6:27 to go, Bradford marched the Eagles downfield with little hint of any resistance. A hold on center Jason Kelce wiped away a 25-yard screen to Mathews, leaving the Eagles in first-and-16. They made it back to third-and-1 but weren’t able to convert; the Falcons flooded the B-gap to the right of Gardner, with the right guard getting shoved inside and linebacker Paul Worrilow shooting through to meet Mathews at the line for no gain. That left the Eagles with a reasonably difficult decision. They faced a fourth-and-1 on the Atlanta 26-yard line with 2:32 left, knowing that a successful field goal would give them the lead, but that it would simultaneously leave the Falcons and their high-powered offense with a shot to win the game by kicking a field goal. A successful fourth-and-1 conversion would have forced the Falcons to start taking their timeouts, made for an easier field goal, provided for the possibility of a touchdown, and left Matt Ryan with less time if he did get the ball again. As it ended up, the decision was so tough that it took Kelly 17 seconds to decide. The cameras depicted him debating the call before eventually sending his field goal unit onto the field with about 23 seconds to go on the play clock; while it didn’t seem like kicker Cody Parkey was too rushed from how he jogged onto the field, he sent the subsequent 44-yard field goal attempt wide right. Afterward, Kelly said the Eagles hadn’t gotten much movement up front on the previous play as justification for the decision to kick. Here’s the part I don’t understand. It’s true the Eagles had been stuffed on third-and-1, and that was hardly an isolated incident on the evening. I wouldn’t have had much faith in the offensive line’s ability to carve out a hole in short-yardage, either. But why wasn’t throwing the ball an option? Bradford had completed his last 12 passes leading into that fourth down, and those were hardly even contested throws. The Eagles were two first downs (and a much shorter field goal) away from ending the game. They’d picked up 18 yards throwing the ball on a fourth-and-1 earlier in the game. Even if Kelly didn’t have faith in his expensively assembled rushing attack to pick up a yard, would anybody in the stadium have bet on the Falcons coming up with a stop on a lone pass attempt? Kelly’s team did end up getting the ball back when the Falcons went hyper-conservative, running the ball twice before seeing rookie Tevin Coleman stuffed by Malcolm Jenkins in the backfield on a third-and-1 try. And the Falcons did get a final stop, although it required a generous bounce. Matthews came over the middle for what looked like yet another easy completion on third-and-8, and while Bradford’s throw was a little high, it was eminently catchable. The ball bounced off of Matthews’s hands and into the waiting arms of converted safety Ricardo Allen for the game-sealing pick. Matthews was disconsolate after the loss, but it shouldn’t have ever gotten to that point. Even without the benefit of hindsight, Kelly should have gone for it on the earlier fourth down. The numbers suggested the decision was a wash, but I’m skeptical. Coaches often use the game situation and the context of how their players are performing as an excuse to be more conservative than the numbers would suggest they should be in fourth-down situations; given how his passing game was slicing the Falcons apart, here was a place where Kelly should have been more aggressive than the numbers wanted him to be. As much as the focus has been on the Eagles for what they did or did not do, this was a promising start for the Falcons, especially in a game in which Ryan didn’t do his best work. Atlanta’s star quarterback would likely admit he played a sloppy game, throwing two picks — including one in the end zone by debuting Eagles inside linebacker Kiko Alonso — and having a couple more dropped. Ryan also underthrew a would-be touchdown pass on a wheel route in the second half, hitting Connor Barwin in the helmet. Otherwise, Ryan was generally effective, if in part because he was playing with an advanced being at receiver. Preseason speculation has suggested that Julio Jones is in line for an Offensive Player of the Year–caliber campaign, and he absolutely destroyed the Eagles on Monday night, catching nine of the 11 passes thrown to him for 141 yards and two touchdowns. There’s still plenty of pages left in Byron Maxwell’s book as a no. 1 cornerback, but Jones torched the first chapter. It’s one thing for Jones to beat Philadelphia’s new starter, but it’s another altogether when Roddy White was getting in front of Maxwell for receptions on slants and deep crosses. Maxwell will get a breather over the next few weeks, with both Dez Bryant and DeSean Jackson likely to miss their matchups against the Eagles with injuries, but he was pretty mediocre in his Philly debut. The Falcons also have to feel some semblance of hope for their running game after years of seeing the dying embers of Michael Turner and Steven Jackson plow into the line. They finished with a very mediocre 3.0-yard rushing average, but much of that was Devonta Freeman and Ryan, who ran for a combined 25 yards on 15 carries. Coleman is likely going to be the featured back in this offense, and he was a far more exciting weapon Monday night, carrying the ball 20 times for 80 yards while consistently making the right cuts upfield at the right time. For a back who was regarded as a north-south runner with little nuance or patience heading into the draft, he looked like an excellent running back for Kyle Shanahan’s stretch-intensive scheme. I think fans of both teams have something to hold on to after this game, actually. Eagles fans will write off the first half as an irrelevant nightmare, much as was the case when Philadelphia went down 17-0 to the Jaguars at halftime in Week 1 a year ago, and they might not be wrong. And the Falcons can hang their hat on the defensive improvements they showed in the first half with an upgraded running game to boot, knowing that Ryan probably isn’t going to throw two picks a game the rest of the way. This was a narrow game that came down to one fourth-quarter call. And in what must be a strange feeling for Falcons fans, the coach on the wrong end of a late-game decision in the Georgia Dome was somebody besides Mike Smith.",2015-09-15T12:43:44+00:00,NFL,Barnwell
57,A Tale of Four Quarterbacks: Your Week 3 NFL Wrap,"After talking about the league’s 0-2 teams on Friday, this seems like a good time to switch gears and get to the teams atop the NFL. There are six 3-0 teams in the NFL right now, and with all due respect to the teams that have clawed their way to an undefeated record after three games, two of those six teams stand out from the rest. That grouping starts in Foxborough, where the Patriots are picking up where they left off last season. It almost feels like a shame that they’re about to take their bye week, given how well the Patriots are playing right now. They stomped an overmatched Jaguars team on Sunday, 51-17, with Tom Brady throwing for 358 yards and two touchdowns. The natural comparison for this Patriots team is to the 2007 squad, under the obvious idea that this would be another revenge season designed to get back at the league. In 2007, of course, the revenge was for the Spygate saga; this time, it’s for Deflategate and the attempt to suspend Brady for his role in the ball-manipulating controversy. I have to admit that I’ve never really been a believer in the whole EFF YOU season idea. That Patriots team in 2007 was stacked from the beginning, blowing out the Jets, 38-14, in Week 1. They weren’t especially pass-happy late in that stunning string of first-half blowouts, with plenty of stretches where they turned the game over to Heath Evans and Kyle Eckel late. They were so good at times that it just seemed like they wanted to make the opposition look bad. It’s true that Brady is staying in late into games, but that’s not uncommon for Bill Belichick, who rarely takes his star quarterback out. Brady didn’t exit many of New England’s blowouts between 2008 and 2013; one of the rare exceptions was the blowout loss to the Chiefs in Week 4 last year. The EFF YOU argument also implies that the Patriots aren’t otherwise trying their hardest or suffering from (perceived) slights during their other seasons with Brady, which seems silly. What’s also true is that New England’s offense is invoking memories of that legendary 2007 season. The Patriots have scored 119 points through three games, breaking their franchise record and approaching a post-merger league record. The franchise record just wasn’t held by the Patriots team you’re thinking of: The 2002 Patriots actually hit 115 points in three games; they, like the rest of the teams on this list, started 3-0. That Patriots team promptly lost its next four games and finished 9-7, averaging 20.5 points per game the rest of the way. It’s fair to say that probably won’t be happening with this year’s Patriots unless Brady and/or Rob Gronkowski get injured. What this year’s Patriots have done, really, is just keep up what they were doing for most of last season. After that disastrous loss to the Chiefs, the Patriots found an offensive line combination that worked, upped Gronk’s snap count, and began to score in droves. From their Week 5 blowout of the Bengals through Brady’s last full game of the season against the Jets in Week 16, the Patriots averaged 34.5 points per game. During their first three games of the season in 2015, they’ve averaged 39.7 points per game; better, of course, but aided by the fact that they’ve played what are likely to be a pair of mediocre defenses in Pittsburgh and Jacksonville. That’s in itself impressive because it looked like missing players would slow the Patriots down, but they haven’t skipped a beat. Dion Lewis, who spent most of 2014 out of football, has actually been an improvement upon Shane Vereen, fumbles aside. Lewis had three catches across two seasons before arriving in New England, but after catching all five of his targets on Sunday, he has 15 catches on 19 targets for 179 yards.1 That’s a 955-yard pace that would double Vereen’s receiving output from 2014. He’s the latest Belichick running back to be plucked off the scrap heap and contribute for next to nothing, a lineage that starts in New England with Antowain Smith and runs through to LeGarrette Blount, who scored three touchdowns in short-yardage situations on Sunday. Lewis has gotten most of the attention, but there have been surprise contributors elsewhere. With Brandon LaFell on the Physically Unable to Perform list, his role has been filled in alternate weeks by Aaron Dobson and recently acquired Keshawn Martin, who scored a touchdown on Sunday. The interior of the line was expected to be a problem with Dan Connolly retiring and Bryan Stork out indefinitely with a concussion, but even that’s been a positive, with rookies David Andrews and Tre’ Jackson playing well enough at center and right guard, respectively. Andrews gave up his first sack of the season on Sunday, and the Patriots still continue to rotate Marcus Cannon in off the bench for unknown reasons, but anyone who remembers how awful the Patriots offensive line was this time last year can appreciate how valuable competency can be around Brady. If anything, the difference between this team and the 2007 squad is that the defense looks worse, but the numbers overstate that difference. The Patriots have allowed 70 points, but much of that has come in the second half of blowouts the past two weeks. Malcolm Butler has looked mostly impressive as a no. 1 cornerback, although he dropped a would-be Blake Bortles interception yesterday and has allowed two touchdowns on plays where he mistimed his jump on pickable passes. The Patriots have surprisingly marginalized former star linebacker Jerod Mayo by keeping him out of their sub-packages, but Jamie Collins — who had a sack and a forced fumble yesterday — has been an absolute monster. There’s little reason to think that things will suddenly get much worse for the Patriots. In fact, if you’re one of those fans who wants to compare this team to the 2007 unit and start dreaming of a second undefeated regular season, things appear to be slowly breaking in your favor, although we’re three months away from it being even a remote likelihood. The toughest stretch of New England’s season appeared to be coming up after this bye, when the Patriots were booked for consecutive road games against 2014 division winners. Those games no longer seem quite as scary, given that the Cowboys will be starting Brandon Weeden or Matt Cassel at quarterback and the Colts appear to be a mess. ESPN’s Football Power Index suggests that the Patriots have a 75.3 percent chance of beating a Tony Romo–less Cowboys team and a 54.7 percent chance of topping this flawed Colts squad in Indy. And after that, the schedule begins to really open up. The Patriots are favored by FPI in each of their remaining games short one: Brady-Manning XVII in Week 12, where FPI gives the Patriots a 49.4 percent chance of topping the Broncos. Here’s the Patriots’ win expectancy for each of their remaining games2 along with their chances of going 16-0 heading into each of those contests: The chances are still incredibly high that the Patriots will slip up, that the Giants or the Bills or the Jets will get them in that rare game in which Brady throws four picks. It happens to just about every great team. Patriots fans might want a 16-0 campaign, but they’ll happily trade a couple of regular-season losses for another trip to the Super Bowl. FPI gives them a 39.7 percent chance of making a trip back, with no other AFC team above 20 percent. There, they can do the one thing the 2007 team failed to accomplish. Norm Hall/Getty Images The only team that FPI pegs with a greater chance of making the Super Bowl is the only team that has managed to outscore the Patriots so far this season. You may have noticed the Cardinals sneaking into the table of greatest season-opening three-game offenses above, and in fact, Arizona has been an unholy force so far this season. The Cardinals have posted a plus-77 point differential through three games in 2015. That’s the seventh-best figure since the 1970 merger. Four of the six teams with better point differentials than this Cardinals team through three games made it to the Super Bowl, and FPI gives the Cardinals a 41.2 percent chance of following those teams to the big game. Now, this is awkward. The Cardinals were supposed to decline this year. It’s not even a quarter of the way into the season, and we don’t have to go far to think about a Cardinals team that got off to a dominant start before falling apart, given that the 2012 team started 4-0 before losing 11 of its final 12 games. It’s also simply inaccurate to compare those two teams, and increasingly, it’s becoming inaccurate to compare what the 2014 Cardinals looked like to this 2015 version. The easy story is that the 2015 Cardinals are what the 2014 Cardinals would have been if Carson Palmer hadn’t gotten hurt. Given that the Cards were 6-0 with Palmer last year and have started 3-0 with Palmer in 2015, one can see why that story makes some sense. On a point basis, though, they’re playing dramatically better: That’s not the same team. That 2014 Cardinals team, outscoring the opposition by nine points, would be one of the best teams in football in a typical season. They would be like the 2014 Patriots, who outscored their opposition by 9.7 points per game. The 2015 Cardinals would be the best team in NFL history. They would take the 2007 Patriots, who outscored their opposition by 19.7 points per game, and throw another touchdown on for good measure. And this is mostly happening with the same personnel, at least among the players who were around when Palmer was in the lineup. Arizona’s top two offseason acquisitions haven’t played; former 49ers guard Mike Iupati has missed the first three games after undergoing knee surgery, while first-round pick D.J. Humphries has been a healthy scratch at tackle. The Cardinals got suspended tackle Bobby Massie back for Sunday and have made changes at halfback, with the 2014 version of Andre Ellington swapped out for a combination of rookie David Johnson alongside Ellington in Week 1 and free agent Chris Johnson afterward. Chris Johnson, who floundered in free agency for months, ran for 110 yards and two touchdowns on Sunday. Otherwise, though, this is basically the same team getting 16.2 points per game more out of its offense with Palmer under center than it was a year ago. How are the Cardinals doing it? Dominating the red zone. San Francisco became the first team to stop the Cardinals in the red zone this season, with Arizona kicking a field goal solely because there was one second left on the clock at the end of the first half. The Cardinals have now scored 11 touchdowns and one field goal on 12 trips to the red zone this year, meaning that they’ve averaged 6.6 points per red zone possession in 2015.3 That’s otherworldly. It’s also not entirely insane, given that the Cardinals were really good in the red zone with Palmer in 2014. They averaged 5.3 points per red zone possession with him in the lineup, scoring 10 touchdowns and four field goals across 15 trips. With Drew Stanton and Ryan Lindley at the helm, Arizona took 23 trips to the red zone and scored just six touchdowns and 13 field goals, averaging just 3.6 points per possession. That’s almost the difference between the best red zone offense in football over the entire season (Oakland, 5.7 points/possession) and the worst (Jacksonville, 3.8 points/possession). It’s a small sample size, and red zone performance tends to be inconsistent from year to year, but it’s impossible to say that the Cardinals aren’t much better in the red zone with Palmer at the helm. Getting return touchdowns. It’s hard to credit Palmer for this one, but the Cardinals have been taking extra trips to the house with their quarterback on the sideline. Last year, across their 16-game slate, the Cardinals produced five return touchdowns. Two of those were by Antonio Cromartie and Ted Ginn, who are no longer with the team. That’s not an unreasonable number, and there was little reason to think the Cardinals would be particularly above-average or below-average on returns in 2015, given that return touchdowns are also almost entirely random from year to year. Things have changed. The Cardinals already have four return touchdowns in three weeks. They picked up two in Week 2, when David Johnson returned the opening kickoff for a score before Tony Jefferson took a Jay Cutler gift to the house. They added two more in the first quarter on Sunday, when Colin Kaepernick threw ugly interceptions to Justin Bethel (playing his first defensive snap of the year) and Tyrann Mathieu for easy pick-sixes. More than nine points per game of Arizona’s offensive improvement have come from return touchdowns alone. Now, I think even the most aggressive Cardinals fan isn’t going to suggest that Arizona will grab two return touchdowns per week the rest of the way. But creating takeaways is a skill, and the Cardinals could very well be good at that. Mathieu, in particular, is clearly healthier and more productive than he was a year ago. It also helps when the other team makes it easy for you: Mathieu: “Their passing game has just simplified so much it was easy for us to anticipate routes, get some good breaks on the ball today.” — Marcus Thompson (@ThompsonScribe) September 28, 2015 Keeping Palmer healthy. The most important thing the Cardinals could have done heading into the season was ensure that Palmer was healthy for as long as possible. That was hardly a guarantee, given that the former Bengals star has a long injury history and was coming off of a season that included nerve damage in his shoulder and his second torn ACL. The Cardinals made those aforementioned moves to beef up their offensive line, but as I noted, both Iupati and Humphries haven’t taken a single snap. Turns out that it hasn’t mattered. Despite Palmer’s average pass going a league-high 11.1 yards in the air, the Cardinals have done an incredible job of keeping him upright and unmolested. Palmer has had 2.68 seconds to throw before his passes, the fifth-longest rate in the league. And he’s been sacked just once across 91 dropbacks this season, producing a 1.1 percent sack rate that’s the second lowest in football. Again, it’s probably fair to say that they won’t keep this up, but it’s a question of degree. A 1.1 percent sack rate would be right there with the 1988 Dolphins for the lowest figure in modern league history, but the Cardinals can decline some and still do a great job of protecting Palmer. It’s hard to figure that they’re going to get worse as a pass-blocking unit when Iupati debuts and replaces Ted Larsen at left guard. Palmer was sacked on 3.8 percent of his dropbacks last year; if the Cardinals can improve on that figure, it’ll be a job well done for Bruce Arians & Co. Can the Cardinals keep this up? Well, it depends on what “this” is. The Cardinals will probably not continue to cash in on 90 percent of their red zone trips with touchdowns or score two return touchdowns a game or allow Palmer to be sacked once a month. They’re probably not going 16-0, either, though I’m not sure even I would listen to me doubt the Cardinals right now. If “this” means being one of the genuine best teams in football, though, the Cardinals can certainly keep that up. Even if they slip in those aforementioned categories, this offense is playing at a high enough level and is joined by an impressive enough defense that the Cardinals are going to be tough to stop. Their schedule admittedly hasn’t been especially tough so far — their three opponents are a combined 1-5 in non-Cardinals games this season — but when you’re stomping each challenger by nearly four touchdowns per game, it doesn’t matter. The 2014 Cardinals looked like they were going to regress in 2015. The 2015 Cardinals, at least through three weeks, don’t look anything like even the best version of the 2014 Cardinals. Getty Images Tyrod Taylor had what was comfortably his best start so far on Sunday, posting the league’s top QBR — 95.3 — during a 41-14 Bills blowout in Miami. Taylor finished up 21-of-29 for 277 yards and three touchdowns while running a more sustainable offensive scheme than the hyper-conservative one he ran successfully against the Colts in Week 1. He got some help, because Miami’s defense had a brutal day. The Dolphins’ lowlight came on the opening play of the fourth quarter, when a blown coverage led to an easy touchdown catch for Chris Hogan. Taylor actually stares down Hogan for most of the play before delivering a perfect throw down the sideline, but watch the defensive backs on Hogan’s side of the field:  This simply shouldn’t happen. It looks like the Dolphins should be in a simple three-deep coverage with four intermediate zones … except cornerback Jamar Taylor bumps Hogan and then proceeds to settle in the intermediate zone as Hogan runs past him. Jamar Taylor thinks he has safety help, but there’s no way the Dolphins can expect Walt Aikens, in center field, to cover both sidelines like he’s DirecTV Earl Thomas. He actually sees the quarterback staring down Hogan and is able to sprint over to try to break up the play, but the only way this wasn’t going to be a touchdown was if Tyrod missed the throw. And he didn’t. This is the thing you have to worry about if you’re a Dolphins fan. Miami has built its defense around several stars, and those stars have to be playing at a high level for things to go well. They’re not right now. One of Miami’s three quarterback knockdowns came on this play, but the Dolphins failed to sack Taylor once. Ndamukong Suh, who presumably wasn’t freelancing this week, had two tackles for loss against the run without pestering Taylor. Cameron Wake, struggling with a hamstring problem, didn’t play his usual complement of snaps. Brent Grimes hasn’t looked like his usual self this year and was powerless to do anything about this throw. You can break down the weak links on this Miami defense, and on this play, the chain snapped. Chris Lee/St. Louis Post-Dispatch/TNS via Getty Images Before Sunday, it would have been hard to imagine that Steelers fans would be happy to hear that Ben Roethlisberger was going to miss four to six weeks, but after early fears that Roethlisberger suffered a season-ending injury against the Rams, it’s a timeline they’ll happily accept. Pittsburgh’s star quarterback suffered a sprained MCL after a Mark Barron sack yesterday afternoon, an injury that should keep him out for at least one month. As with any hit that injures a quarterback, Barron’s sack was controversial. Steelers fans were likely angry4 after the fact because Barron hit Roethlisberger below the knees, a violation of the so-called Brady Rule, designed to protect quarterbacks from defenders diving at their knees or legs as Bernard Pollard did when ending Tom Brady’s season in 2008. I think Barron’s hit was illegal and should have been flagged as a foul, but I don’t think it was deliberately dirty. Watch the play and you’ll see Barron beginning to trip and fall as he approaches the line of scrimmage on his blitz. He’s on his hands and knees crawling at Roethlisberger like a zombie by the time he gets to the quarterback, at which point he clearly hits Roethlisberger below the knee, causing the injury. Barron had a free path to the passer and his momentum was falling forward toward Roethlisberger; he would have basically had to lie on the ground and let Roethlisberger go right by him to avoid making the hit he made. It’s not as if Barron was running upright and tried to clip Roethlisberger at the ankles. He made the only play he could have made, and that happened to cause an injury. Yes, that play wasn’t legal, but it wasn’t inherently dirty. Regardless of whether it should have been flagged, the damage is done. The Steelers had their offensive starters miss just seven games in 2014 and fielded the league’s healthiest offense per Adjusted Games Lost, but Roethlisberger’s injury will make him the fourth Steelers offensive starter to miss time in 2015. The Steelers just got Le’Veon Bell back from suspension and will get Martavis Bryant back after Week 4, but Roethlisberger will join center Maurkice Pouncey as a long-term injury absentee. It ends a string of 39 consecutive regular-season starts for Roethlisberger, a remarkable run for a player who made it through 16 games just once during his first nine seasons in the league. It’s difficult to gauge a more accurate timeline for Roethlisberger’s return because the reports of his injury are still vague. While we found out on Sunday night that Roethlisberger had a sprained MCL, the knee sprain’s severity and degree remain unclear. It’s likely that Roethlisberger is suffering from a second-degree MCL sprain, which has a six-week recovery time frame but often sees NFL players return in two to four weeks. Roethlisberger has a history of being a quick healer and returning to the field at less than 100 percent, even if it perhaps stands as a detriment to his team’s chances. In 2011, Roethlisberger tried to grit his way through a high ankle sprain without missing any time and played poorly in a 20-3 loss to the 49ers; he took the following week off before returning for a Week 17 game against the Browns, where he again struggled before a third disappointing performance against Tim Tebow and the Broncos in a wild-card loss. Roethlisberger is unquestionably tough and regularly plays through injuries, but rushing him back isn’t in itself a great idea. It’s a shame, too, because Roethlisberger was playing some of the best football of his career. Through three games, Roethlisberger’s 91.3 QBR was the second-best mark in football behind Aaron Rodgers. Pittsburgh was being slowed down by a very good Rams defense on Sunday, but the bulk of Roethlisberger’s success had come during the first two games, without his star running back or his primary deep threat. The only quarterback in the league who had been throwing his passes farther downfield than Roethlisberger was Carson Palmer, and Roethlisberger was still completing more than 75 percent of his passes before the injury. He was in control of the offense in a way that replacement Michael Vick simply cannot and will not be. Roethlisberger is a far more accurate passer, even on the bevy of screens the Steelers love to run to set up their throws downfield. Since his rookie season in 2004, Roethlisberger has completed 73.2 percent of his passes that travel no farther than 5 yards past the line of scrimmage. That’s the sixth-highest rate among quarterbacks with at least 800 such attempts over that time frame. Vick has picked up 66.4 percent of those same passes, good for 30th over the same time frame. It might be better if Vick had been a steady backup behind Roethlisberger for years, but that isn’t the case. He only signed with the Steelers on August 25 after longtime reserve Bruce Gradkowski was placed on injured reserve with a dislocated finger. It’s reasonable to question Vick’s work ethic as a backup after the former Falcons star admitted that he wasn’t prepared to come in last October as a backup for the Jets. And that was in a Marty Mornhinweg–led scheme, one Vick was familiar with from his time in Philadelphia. Vick had never worked with offensive coordinator Todd Haley before last month, so it’s fair to say that he’s still learning the nuances of Haley’s scheme. Even beyond the fact that Vick’s legendary physical skills have obviously eroded, it’s hard to expect him to be comfortable in Pittsburgh’s offense, which is likely to get far more vanilla. There was never going to be a good time for the Steelers to lose their star quarterback, but they’re about to enter a particularly brutal stretch of their schedule. Vick will have a short week to prepare for his starting debut against a desperate Ravens team on Thursday. After that, the Steelers play the Chargers, Cardinals, Chiefs, and Bengals. The move solidifies 3-0 Cincinnati at the top of the division, especially if Roethlisberger doesn’t return in time for its clash with Pittsburgh on November 1. The 0-3 Ravens caught what could be a season-saving break with this injury; they’re already listed as three-point favorites for Thursday night, something that would have been unimaginable with a healthy Roethlisberger in the lineup. It’s hard to say how much Pittsburgh’s chances will be affected by Roethlisberger’s absence until we know just how long he’ll actually be missing, but it’s fair to say that the Steelers are going to badly miss their star quarterback. What may end up saving their playoff chances may actually be what happened after Roethlisberger went down in the third quarter. The Steelers led 9-3 at the time and managed to keep that lead, with the Rams seeing their lone drive deep into Pittsburgh territory fall apart with a pair of false starts in the red zone before kicking a field goal. A much-maligned Steelers secondary came up with an interception on a dismal Nick Foles pass before kicking a field goal and promptly forcing the Rams to turn the ball over on downs, ending the game. A 1-2 Steelers team without Roethlisberger and about to face their upcoming schedule would have been dead in the water. At 2-1, they may have banked just enough to keep afloat until Roethlisberger returns, especially if he beats those six-week estimates. It’s a stunning turn of events for a team that before this weekend would have expected — not hoped — to make the playoffs this season, but given how bad things looked while Roethlisberger was writhing on the scorched St. Louis turf, its current situation beats the alternative.",2015-09-28T10:39:55+00:00,NFL,Barnwell
58,Your Comprehensive Week 3 NFL Picks,"Earlier today, I wrote about the playoff chances of the league’s nine teams that started 0-2; now, let’s get to the picks for this weekend. I took the Giants -3 last night, and while I’m trying to block out any memories of that brutally ugly football game, the box score tells me that the Giants won and covered. As usual, the lines come from the consensus Vegas sportsbook figures posted at VegasInsider.com. Home teams are listed in CAPS. RAMS over Steelers (-1)
Antonio Brown’s five-catch, 50-yard streak has always been silly; not only is it an entirely arbitrary cutoff, but it undersells how great of a player he is. Even though they’re minimums, those figures add up to 80 catches for 800 yards. It’s the sort of streak that your basic starting wide receiver would aim to hit on a weekly basis. Brown is the best wideout in football: We can set our sights higher. What would that look like? Well, let’s start with Brown posting 100 or more receiving yards in four straight games, stretching back to last season and including Pittsburgh’s playoff loss to Baltimore. That’s a pretty great start. The record for most consecutive 100-yard games since 1960, per Pro-Football-Reference.com’s essential Streak Finder, is eight. Calvin Johnson set that in 2012, and Demaryius Thomas came up just short with a seven-game streak last season. That’s a far more dignified streak for Brown, a genuine superstar. He should get a steady diet of screens to slow down the St. Louis pass rush on Sunday. Buccaneers (+6.5) over TEXANS
I couldn’t understand why the Texans threw the ball 58 times last week with Ryan Mallett as their quarterback. Then I watched their first play from scrimmage and it made sense:  I don’t think anybody would have blamed Bill O’Brien for just giving up and walking out if that was how his team executed the opening play. That’s not to say Mallett was good. He was 11-of-29 for 74 yards in the first half, and if anything, those numbers somehow inflate his performance. Mallett has such a strong arm that he can throw his way out of (and into) mistakes, but when he’s not zipping an out to an open receiver, he does stuff like this:  The Texans are favored by 6.5 points. Eagles (+2) over JETS
Through two weeks, teams have been comfortable dropping back into coverage and daring Sam Bradford to squeeze the ball between zones. Bradford has been blitzed on only 11.0 percent of his dropbacks, the second-lowest rate in the league; only Mallett has been blitzed less, which is the same sort of logic you apply when you try to stay a few car lengths away from student drivers. Bradford has been bad under any circumstances, but he’s been worse against those few blitzes; his 26.3 QBR against no rush falls to 15.1 when teams send the house. Todd Bowles has sent pressure 47.0 percent of the time through two weeks — why wouldn’t he do the same against a passer who has shown virtually no ability to make opponents pay with big plays? PANTHERS (-3) over Saints
PANTHERS (-6.5) over Saints
The different lines reflect Vegas’s thinking based on Drew Brees’s availability. VegasInsider had -3 posted as the line before it was announced that Brees might not play; now that he’s been declared out of the game, we’ll go with the -6.5. Or we can just not care about the points altogether, which might be the better way to approach it. Even if Brees had played, his bruised rotator cuff suggests the Saints would have been more likely to go with a heavier run approach than they typically have in years past. That was the messaging as they made moves this offseason, but despite their efforts, their rushing game has been awful this season. You’ve heard about the Eagles and how dreadful they’ve been; their running backs are getting hit after 1.39 yards, the second-worst rate in the league. You can probably figure out who is below them: Sean Payton’s Saints, who have their backs taking contact 1.13 yards after receiving the football. And while it makes sense the Eagles would struggle to create running lanes after losing their two starting guards, that shouldn’t be the case in New Orleans, which added a Pro Bowl center in Max Unger as part of the Jimmy Graham trade and used its first-round pick on Stanford tackle Andrus Peat. The problem has instead been at left guard, where the Saints traded Ben Grubbs to the Chiefs to clear cap space. Replacement Tim Lelito has been a mess. Peat has played only five offensive snaps through two weeks, which might be a scarier sight; it’s hardly like the New Orleans line is playing well enough to keep him out of the lineup. PATRIOTS (-13.5) over Jaguars
Jacksonville’s pass rush continues to improve. Last year, it posted the league’s second-best sack rate, but the Jags weren’t able to generate the sort of consistent pressure on non-sack plays that creates problems for quarterbacks. Their pressure rate of 22.8 percent was the fifth-worst in football. Through two games in 2015, though, they have been a force, bumping their pressure rate up to 32.1 percent. That’s the seventh-best figure in the league. Their secondary is an issue, though, and if the pass rush doesn’t get home, that secondary gets exposed. And the easiest way to make sure the pass rush doesn’t get home is to throw the ball as quickly as possible. Tom Brady is very good at that, and he keeps getting his passes out quicker and quicker. ESPN has tracked the seconds before a pass is thrown going back to 2011; here’s Brady’s time before his average pass by year: The lowest figure for a full season is 2.22 seconds, which Peyton Manning hit last year. The only guy who has gotten his passes out quicker than Brady is Matt McGloin, and it’s fair to say they’re making different passes; McGloin has also thrown the third-shortest average pass in the league, while Brady’s passes travel 7.8 yards in the air, right below the league average of 7.9. Some of this is a schematic choice — the Patriots didn’t want Brady holding the football against that Bills pass rush — but it’s clearly working for the Patriots. It wouldn’t be a surprise to see them continue the quick throws against the Jags. BROWNS (-3.5) over Raiders
As much as you might be disappointed to see Johnny Manziel replaced by the returning Josh McCown, you cannot possibly be as disappointed as Browns wideout Travis Benjamin, who had three receiving touchdowns of 50 yards or more with Manziel at the helm in two weeks. McCown has thrown three touchdowns of 50 yards or more … in 14 years. One of those was to Anquan Boldin in 2003, and the most recent was to Mike Evans, who was 10 years old when Boldin caught that bomb. It seems unfair to suggest that McCown should lose his job because he suffered a concussion while trying to Elway into the end zone against the Jets in Week 1, but is there anyone who really thinks this Browns team is going anywhere with the journeyman backup at the helm? Mike Pettine didn’t bench McCown, but he’s now stuck in the trap that often comes when head coaches make a quarterback change early in the year; if the guy who was on the bench shows enough to suggest he’s better than the starter and you send him back to the sideline, you’re going to spend the rest of the year waiting for the moment when you put him back in. Manziel wasn’t great, but you don’t think that Browns fans are going to be chanting for him the moment McCown starts to struggle? Unless McCown rolls off a 2013 Bears stretch over the next few weeks, the Cleveland offense is just going to be waiting for the other shoe to drop. VIKINGS (-2.5) over Chargers
RAVENS (-2.5) over Bengals
DOLPHINS (-3) over Bills
PACKERS (-6.5) over Chiefs Colts (-3) over TITANS
As much as the Indianapolis offense has struggled this season, the Colts defense hasn’t exactly held up its end of the bargain. Indy has allowed 47 points over its first two games to offenses quarterbacked by Tyrod Taylor and Ryan Fitzpatrick. Not great. The acknowledged problem has been injuries at cornerback, where Greg Toler and Darius Butler were already out in Week 2 before Vontae Davis went down with a concussion. The Jets had far too many free releases and were able to create separation with the combination of Brandon Marshall and Eric Decker much more easily than they would have against the Colts’ regular starters. The more subtle problem that’s come up as a result of those cornerback issues is that Chuck Pagano can’t blitz. He’s naturally terrified to leave those corners in man coverage, and that’s changing the way he operates. Last year, Pagano sent blitzes on 44.5 percent of opposing dropbacks, the second-highest rate in the league. This year, that figure has dropped to 27.1 percent, just below the league average of 29.0 percent. Indy’s pressure rate has dropped from 24.5 percent to 22.0 percent, and through two games, it has just one sack and two quarterback knockdowns. Rookie Henry Anderson, not Trent Cole or Robert Mathis, has been the team’s best pass-rusher. Pagano needs to get his cornerbacks healthy, and when they are, he needs to start sending blitzes to try to get the Colts defense right again. Falcons (-1) over COWBOYS
As much as Brandon Weeden can lead a team, he’ll be leading the Cowboys out to face the 2-0 Falcons in Dallas this week. I think the Falcons will prevail, but if you’re a little skeptical of their 2-0 start, I can’t say I blame you. They’ve won their first two games by a combined six points; given that the minimum differential in this grouping is obviously two points, it’s fair to say the Falcons are one of the more narrow 2-0 teams in recent memory. Because point differential matters, a team like Atlanta tends to be less impressive than 2-0 teams that blow out the competition. Since 1970, the 61 teams that started 2-0 with a point differential of 10 points or fewer (like the Falcons) promptly went 427-413-1 (.508) the rest of the way. They were average teams. The 54 teams that started 2-0 and blew out the opposition by a combined 40 points over those two games went 455-279-3 (.619) over the remainder of their seasons. The Falcons would happily take a 9-7 record after the last two seasons, which is where history suggests they’re eventually heading. SEAHAWKS (-14.5) over Bears
You can use the Vegas line and the over/under set for a game to figure out what a team is expected to score in a given contest; it’s what is commonly referred to as a team total. As you might expect given that the Bears are heading into the Pacific Northwest with Jimmy Freaking Clausen as their quarterback, their team total is not very high. As 14.5-point underdogs in a game where the over/under is 43.5, we would expect the Bears to score 14.5 points.1 That’s not historically low — the 1992 Seahawks once had a team total of 8.75 points in a game against the Steelers — but in the modern era of scoring, it’s a pretty distressing figure. There were only three team totals in 2014 that were two touchdowns or fewer, two of which came against the Seahawks in consecutive weeks: the 49ers in Week 15 (13.5 points) and the Ryan Lindley–led Cardinals in Week 16 (10 points). I was fully expecting teams on the low end like these Bears to outplay their expected team total; after all, it’s far easier to underestimate their chances and struggle to even imagine them scoring than it is to think about what often happens in reality, where teams score from short fields and throw in garbage-time touchdowns. So I went back and looked at all the teams with a team total of 14 points or fewer over the past five years. The implied totals suggested they would score an average of 13.1 points. In reality, those 44 teams have scored … 13.2 points. Goes to show what I know. 49ers (+6.5) over CARDINALS
The best two-game stretches of Carson Palmer’s career, as rated by Adjusted Yards Per Attempt: Palmer has quietly been unreal through two weeks. He’s completing 64.3 percent of his passes despite throwing an average of 10.8 yards in the air; the only quarterback who tops him in both categories is Ben Roethlisberger. Palmer is throwing a touchdown once every eight pass attempts. He still hasn’t been sacked despite playing behind an offensive line that’s down two regular starters. And he’s averaging 8.8 yards per attempt, which doesn’t even take into account that he has generated four pass-interference calls for 120 yards through two weeks; the only other quarterback in the league over 50 yards is Aaron Rodgers, who has 86. Granted, Palmer played the Saints and Bears through two weeks, so he isn’t exactly playing brutal defenses, but those are MVP-caliber numbers. Pretty good for a guy the Raiders dumped to the Cardinals two years ago for what ended up amounting to draft capital worth the 184th pick in a typical draft. Broncos (-3) over LIONS
It’s still very early, of course, but the Broncos have the league’s second-worst offensive DVOA through two weeks. They’ve played a pair of pretty good defenses in the Ravens and Chiefs, and DVOA doesn’t account for the quality of opposition this early in the season, so it’s fair to expect them to improve based on that alone, but this is still a rough start. Peyton Manning’s pass-heavy efficiency is basically built to make DVOA happy, as much as a quarterback’s style can excite an Excel algorithm, so this is weird territory. His offenses in Indianapolis and Denver have finished in the top six in offensive DVOA 13 times in 16 seasons. Manning has had rough two-game stretches, but he has never operated an offense quite this bad. It’s always important to avoid overreacting, and Denver’s offense is probably going to get better, but Manning isn’t exactly getting any younger. It may be more likely the Broncos return to competency instead of the top of the charts. And competency might even be off the table. LAST WEEK: 9-7
THIS WEEK SO FAR: 1-0
THIS SEASON: 20-12-1 (.621)",2015-09-25T15:16:28+00:00,NFL,Barnwell
59,Nine Lives: Which Winless Team Will End Up in the Playoffs?,"You probably saw the numbers this week. The exact figure depends on the cutoff you choose, but since the league went to its current divisional structure in 2002, just 10 of the 107 teams that started the season 0-2 ultimately made a postseason run. That’s 9.4 percent. By the end of Week 2, we were left with nine 0-2 teams around the NFL. You can see where I’m going with this one. Even if you fudge the numbers a tiny bit, recent history suggests that a typical season will see just one of those nine 0-2 teams rebound and head into the postseason. The other eight are playing for fantasy football and draft position purposes. Yikes. Given how good some of this year’s 0-2 teams were expected to be heading into the season, it’s perhaps more likely we’ll see two or more of these teams advance into January than we would in other years. FiveThirtyEight’s Elo model suggests that two or three of these teams will make the postseason if they play as expected the rest of the way. Of course, it may also be possible that the numbers don’t know some important detail about these teams that has led them to that fateful 0-2 start. We’re all left simultaneously trying to avoid overreacting to the dismal first two weeks while frantically searching to find what might be a fatal flaw. Football can be confusing, especially in September. If 0-2 is bad, 0-3 is virtually a point of no return. The last team to start 0-3 and make the playoffs was the 1998 Buffalo Bills, who rode Doug Flutie to the playoffs after their initial three-game skid. Eighty-two teams have started 0-3 since without making it to the postseason. It’s not out of the question for a team to do it again, but it’s taking a long shot and stretching it even further. After the 0-2 Giants beat Washington on Thursday night, that leaves us with eight must-win games coming up in Week 3. Let’s run through the nine teams that started 0-2 and try to figure out why they might be the ones to buck history and advance into the postseason. These aren’t power rankings of how these teams would perform in a vacuum, but instead a comparison of their relative playoff chances given their talent level, circumstances, injuries, etc. And it starts with the team I think everyone can agree belongs at the bottom of the list: OK, it’s not exactly easy to find reasons to believe that the Bears should have high hopes for 2015. They weren’t expected to do very much before the season, and after an 0-2 start, they’re about to head to Seattle to face a pissed-off Seahawks team in a home opener that will now include Kam Chancellor. Oh, and because Jay Cutler is injured, Jimmy Clausen — whose only win in a 1-10 career came over John Skelton in 2010 — will be under center for Chicago, with both wideouts who would start for Chicago (Alshon Jeffery and first-rounder Kevin White) likely absent as well. The Bears are the league’s biggest underdogs in Week 3, and it’s exceedingly unlikely they’ll come close to the playoffs. There have been things to like for Chicago this season. The defense was better than expected against Aaron Rodgers in Week 1, albeit in a game where they allowed the Packers to score 31 points, mostly on throws past overmatched starting corner Alan Ball. And the much-maligned Cutler actually played very well for most of his short run against the Cardinals, starting 8-of-8 for 120 yards and a touchdown against the stout Arizona pass defense before throwing a pick-six and injuring his hamstring while trying to tackle Tony Jefferson. Baby steps! But, you know, like a baby with a pulled hamstring. The Lions are already in a lot of trouble. They’ve started the season by losing their first two games on the road by a combined 15 points, and each of those games needed garbage-time touchdowns from Detroit to make things look more competitive than they were. The Lions are already two games behind the Packers and 1.5 games down on the Vikings, given that Minnesota beat the Lions last Sunday. Mike Zimmer’s defense beat up poor Matthew Stafford during that game, knocking him down eight times on 53 dropbacks and leading to a terrifying observation afterward: Stafford was beat up so much, he didn’t even know from which wound he was bleeding all over himself. Crazy. — Kyle Meinke (@kmeinke) September 21, 2015 That sounds like the worst game ever, and while it looks like Stafford will play through a rib injury this weekend, injuries are giving the Lions fits. Star linebacker DeAndre Levy has missed the first two games with a mysterious, unexplained hip injury; the team had to deny rumors this week that Levy was suffering from a Chilean parasite, which seems absurd. Defensive end Ziggy Ansah missed practice time this week. The right side of the offensive line, Larry Warford and LaAdrian Waddle, missed Week 1. Warford is back, and Waddle should make his season debut in Sunday’s game against the Broncos, who have pressured opposing quarterbacks on a league-high 50 percent of dropbacks. If the Lions can’t beat Denver in their home opener, their playoff chances might very well not exist. Much like the Lions, Houston’s performance looks a lot better by virtue of what it’s done late in the fourth quarter of comfortable losses. The Texans went down 27-9 against the Chiefs before two scoring drives in the final five minutes left it as a seven-point loss. Things were closer last week when they scored a touchdown with 6:31 left to make it 24-17, but their attempt to tie included a blocked field goal, two extended drives thanks to Kony Ealy penalties on third down, and a fourth-down conversion before Carolina came up with a fourth-and-16 stop. The problem has been an offense squeezed by poor quarterbacks and injuries. Bill O’Brien benched Brian Hoyer after three quarters for Ryan Mallett and stuck with the backup for the Panthers game, saying Mallett had given the team a “spark.” It seems bad when your team needs a spark in early September. Mallett promptly started the second game 11-of-29 for 74 yards as part of a game plan that eventually saw the overmatched passer throw 58 passes. The offense badly misses Arian Foster, who is likely a week away from returning after groin surgery. Even worse, star wideout DeAndre Hopkins has missed practice this week with a concussion, which would leave Houston with a passing attack built around Mallett throwing to Nate Washington and Cecil Shorts III. On the bright side, the Texans do get to face the Buccaneers. Dumpster fires need sparks, too. Would you believe it: another offense felled by an injury to a totally irreplaceable player! Here, the precious cargo is Drew Brees’s rotator cuff, which was bruised during Sunday’s loss to the Buccaneers. The Saints attempted to take some heat off Brees this offseason by investing in an improved offensive line and doubling down on running backs, but first-round pick Andrus Peat has played just five offensive snaps at tackle, while C.J. Spiller played seven snaps in his season debut last week. The Saints will be happy to see the return of Jairus Byrd and Keenan Lewis from injuries if they can make it back Sunday, but that might not be enough if Brees misses the game. The last time Brees missed a start because of injury was in 2003, when no. 1 receiver Brandin Cooks was in fifth grade. A bruised rotator cuff can be a week-to-week injury; Marc Bulger missed a game with a similar rotator cuff injury in 2009. On the bright side, it would push Luke McCown into the lineup, which would complete the most unlikely run of notoriety Luke McCown ever could have expected after those commercials. The Saints get the Panthers this weekend, and while they’ll be happy to face a Carolina team that hasn’t exactly looked incredible despite a 2-0 start, a loss would put them 3.5 games behind Carolina before October has even begun. Baltimore might have been my pick to win the AFC North before the season, but losing the first two games wasn’t part of the plan. Losing to the Broncos in Week 1 after Steve Smith Sr. dropped a pass in the end zone was one thing, but losing to the Raiders and giving up 37 points in the process was another. Derek Carr even left a few big plays on the field. Could Terrell Suggs have really been that valuable to the defense? Like New Orleans, Baltimore finds itself in a divisional must-win against the current leaders. The Ravens can’t afford to fall three games and a tiebreaker behind the Bengals before the end of September, and while Baltimore may be a narrow favorite in its home opener Sunday, it hasn’t come close to putting together a complete quarter, let alone a complete game. Carr torched the Baltimore secondary last week, and a wildly impressive Bengals offensive line has helped Andy Dalton avoid a single sack or turnover. If that keeps up, the Ravens will be in serious trouble. The Ravens would be strong favorites over the Giants on a neutral field, but here, the situation favors Big Blue. Granted, I’m cheating and counting the victory the Giants claimed last night to get out of the NFC East cellar, but the Giants have now had double-digit leads in the fourth quarter of each of their three games. Granted, they’ve managed to hold on to exactly one of them, but it’s still a sign that they’re playing well in otherwise-meaningful situations before playing some incredibly unclutch situational football. It will disappear quickly because the Giants won the game, but let’s not forget about Tom Coughlin’s latest fourth-quarter mistake. Here, Coughlin threw his challenge flag after a Washington touchdown, costing the Giants their final timeout. It’s inexcusable for a head coach to make that sort of mistake, especially a veteran coach like Coughlin. It was certainly the most “Dad, you’re embarrassing me” penalty a coach can get, and it makes me wonder whether teams will eventually have their head coach cede challenge duties in the same way they occasionally give up play-calling duties. The newly clutch Giants weren’t all that different last night. The late score that appeared to seal it was a third-down lob from Eli Manning to a covered Rueben Randle that was bobbled and then grabbed out of space for a touchdown. The Giants promptly allowed a kickoff return for a touchdown and then had Manning throw another ugly pass on third down, extending the game. It didn’t matter, because Kirk Cousins appears to develop a low-grade fever when he faces the Giants on national television, but — sadly, for the Giants defense — they don’t get to play Cousins every week. This team should be 3-0; instead, it’s just happy to be 1-2. Even knowing that the Eagles are a half-game behind the Giants and a game and a half behind the Cowboys in the wide-open NFC East, I like their chances a little more than those of the Giants. It’s far easier to imagine the Eagles making the sort of adjustments they need, given the talent they have, than it is to believe that the Giants will suddenly blossom a couple of offensive linemen and a safety and a pass-rusher by the end of the season. The improvements have to come, to some extent, from Chip Kelly. Chris Brown noted on Twitter how Philadelphia’s play-calling was so obvious by virtue of how stagnant their personnel groupings and spacing on offense have been. Reacting to last week’s disastrous performance from Sam Bradford and this offense, it wouldn’t surprise me to see Kelly really focus on showing different looks to the opposition starting Sunday against the Jets. He almost has to make schematic changes, given that it’s too early to make personnel decisions like benching Bradford or DeMarco Murray (who may not even play given his hamstring injury). Even if Kelly does, the offense may still struggle to get going. The Jets may be lucky to have recovered all eight fumbles under Todd Bowles, but the former Arizona defensive coordinator brought in a bevy of defensive backs this offseason and has installed his favored blitz-happy scheme. Darrelle Revis (questionable with a groin injury) and the rest of his defensive backfield brethren can hold up against Philadelphia’s athletes in man coverage, freeing Bowles to send exotic pressures at Bradford, who is already naturally inclined to check down. With the Giants choking and the combination of Tony Romo and Dez Bryant both injured, the Eagles could possibly be in a more advantageous spot than they were before the season started, even at 0-2. Per FiveThirtyEight, the Seahawks had a league-best 78 percent chance of making the playoffs before the season started. Now, just two weeks later, their odds are down to 56 percent. If the unthinkable happens and they lose at home to Chicago this weekend, the Seahawks will be in serious danger of falling below 50 percent. As 14-point favorites, that seems extremely unlikely. Seattle should really be concerned less about this week and more about the weeks to come. After the Bears, four of Seattle’s next five games come against 2014 playoff teams. And while I’m not super high on Detroit or Cincinnati, a stretch that includes them alongside the Panthers and Cowboys won’t be easy. The Seahawks won’t have to deal with Romo during their crucial November 1 meeting since he is on short-term IR and won’t be eligible to return. If the defense fixes itself (and it should) and the offense gets just enough Jimmy Graham to get going, the Seahawks should be fine. Their concern at this point is less about the playoffs and more about beating the Cardinals for first place in the NFC West. As bad as they’ve been, the Colts are no. 1 for me. I wrote Monday about why they should improve in the weeks to come, and much of that boils down to schedule. Indy is about to start a three-game run through the AFC South, and by the end of that stretch, it wouldn’t surprise me if it was atop the division at 3-2.",2015-09-25T09:56:20+00:00,NFL,Barnwell
60,DRAKE DANCE REVOLUTION: The ‘Hotline Bling’ Video,"I have this friend named Felipe. He’s a great man. A strong man. A smart man. And at his most indifferent, still a life of the party. Someone who can be sitting on a couch for two hours, hear a song he likes, walk onto the dance floor, dance to two songs — thereby changing the tone of the entire evening for many present — and then go sit back down and chill. When I run into Felipe at night, and we’re both out, and there’s music playing, and there’s a dance floor, and a certain song comes on, and there’s something resembling a circle — or really any empty space with scattered humans — I know he’s going to get after it, which gives me full clearance to get after it. It’s unclear if either of us has any dance moves, in the literal sense. But in the moment, when all of those late-night planets align, there are few people who dance better than Felipe. And in that same moment, one of the few people present who can match him — in my head — is me. And as I look around — again, in this moment — the assortment of goony friends I arrived with or knew would be present are also dance-peaking, doing their own hyper-personalized creations, existing always on beat, filled to the brim with confidence in their movements, feeling spectacular. Twenty seconds into watching the video for “Hotline Bling” by Aubrey Drake Graham, the first thing I thought was, Oh wow, that’s Felipe. And then I kept watching and was like, Oh shit, that’s Matt. And then I kept watching and thought, Oh Lord, that’s me. It’s a great video in the sense that he pulls off dancing the way one would in a crowded setting — your vulnerabilities calmed by the crew that surrounds you that is also doing their own version of dancing — by his lonesome.  The first “Internet opinion” I saw about the video prompted me to click in order to see “silly Drake dancing.” I clicked on the video but, oddly enough, saw nothing silly. There’s nothing silly about the dancing in “Hotline Bling.” This is just dancing. Riddle me this, author of Internet opinion, what else is someone supposed to do to this song while listening to “Hotline Bling” and existing in a James Turrell biodome? Every single move that emanates from Drake’s gray one-size-fits-all ensemble is arguably the only thing that is supposed to be happening. That slow, crouched-over thing he did to “you used to, you used to” — yes. That side-to-side heel-toe later in the video — of course. Those occasional slow-motion movements — I mean, have you ever listened to music while standing up? That Chris Tucker as Michael Jackson head and arms and neck thing — OBVIOUSLY.  What your are witnessing is Yung Aubrey Bautista absolutely feeling himself, a concept that should not be met with any negative connotations. With that said, that also has very little to do with actual quality. The idea of feeling yourself does not necessarily imply that the dance moves are great. Feeling yourself is simply when you could not be any more a fan of yourself and how you look and what you are doing and, in turn, what you are giving to the world in that moment. It’s that feeling when you start dancing, and then stumble on a move, and then really like that move. When this happens, chances are you’re going to dig into it more and more with each sidestep. Each time, a little more knee bend. A little more head nod. A little more sass. A little more attitude. A little more goddamn. These aren’t theoretical concepts, these are actual facts of life.  In this video, you’re seeing the confidence of someone who’s been going to the same bar every other weekend for three years. It’s post-posturing. It’s when you show up in sweats at 1 a.m. because you can. It’s how you dance when a public space becomes your living room. You’re beyond needing to impress strangers, because you’re not the stranger — everyone else is. Very few of us have the talents of a Chris Brown or Usher or Ciara or Beyoncé. If your dancing skills resemble these people, by all means be a superior mover and distance yourself from the world by any and all means necessary. But contrary to popular belief, the next level on the rung down from “really good dancer” isn’t a “pretty good dancer.” Because there’s nothing worse than a “pretty good dancer.” Because the hallmark trait of a “pretty good dancer” is “someone who is actively trying to be a really good dancer yet isn’t.” And that person is the worst (and if you don’t know this to be true, that person is you). If you aren’t an amazing dancer, the next-best thing is to be an on-beat dancer whose moves create a blissfully irrational confidence in self. Dancing in a way that is often ridiculous, never threatening, and increasingly makes you feel fly-er than the song before.  A less obvious reason this video is startling — beyond the dancing, and the lights, and the REI turtleneck — is that on Drake’s end, we actually see him, unedited, for long periods of time. Music video editing can make the most uncomfortable, near-pubescent artist seem exceedingly cool. If you look at Drake videos from years past, a constant is a patchwork of short clips filled with rapper bravado that are cut and pasted together to form a cocky rapper. You’d typically see him do one or two motions, and then a quick cut, and then he’s somewhere else, doing something else slightly cool, and then another cut and — poof — he’s either back to the former place or a third location, doing something else that some people characterize as cool.  This isn’t Drake-specific. Music video directors are magicians in making all artists look more interesting than they are. In Drake’s past, much of his dorkswag appeal (and in turn, overall confidence in everything) came from editing rather than personality. Looking at someone move and dance and exist for a lengthy period of time, however, is completely different. They have to carry it — in a way that editing can only enhance but not fully control. And with fewer cuts and longer one-take stretches come more room for scrutiny (or, in some cases, praise). This video goes beyond dance ghosts of Drake’s past (like that dumb Yeet-like arm-across-body thing as he’s jumping, or that other dumb thing where he kind of rotates like a compass with the elbow and it’s kind of a “Bye Bye Bye” ‘N Sync thing with the fist pump). The Drake portion of this music video begins with 28 straight seconds of unedited Drake doing things. These are new waters for him: not just the dancing, but consistently existing on camera, with help from no one, needing to be interesting the entire time.  The video for “Hotline Bling” is a good sign if you’re invested in Aubrey Drake Graham, the performer. An obvious weak spot in his repertoire is the live performance, in the sense that he doesn’t have a library of classic performances like a Kanye or a Beyoncé. But then again, those are two people who can interestingly move and exist, alone, for long stretches of time. With Drake, the idea of whether the moves are good and cool is subjective, and to each their own. (They’re phenomenal.) But the fact that he’s doing them, or anything at all, is what you want to see. It’s like the old saying goes, ’tis better to feel yourself than to not feel at all.",2015-10-20T16:42:58+00:00,Music,Browne
61,BigBang: The Perfect Boy Band for 2015,"Saturday nights are special. They’re consistently my only true night of the week to do exactly what I want. These carefree nights can happen, in theory, on any night, but Saturdays are when they happen most often, with the fewest consequences. Fridays also used to be like that — remember Friday nights? Unfortunately, the weight and stress of the workweek typically rears its head around 8:30 p.m. on said Friday, causing the body to crave a night of Blu-ray and Chill, regardless of whether you obey your body’s wishes. I say all this because I care about what manifests on my Saturday nights. Which is why this past Saturday was notable, because I acted very out of character. As in, I left Brooklyn at 6:30 p.m., en route to Newark, New Jersey. And I did this act of self-treason alone. And I did this for work, to cover a concert. And I did this alone, for work, to cover a concert by Korean pop boy band BigBang, a group from which I had heard only one song prior to my trip, and that song I had heard only twice, and I wasn’t even convinced I liked it. The assignment self-haze is a part of my occupational DNA. I’m no stranger to it, for it also takes me to amazingly dark places that result in occasionally fun pieces for a reader who lucked out by not being the one who trolled themselves. My approach to Newark’s Prudential Center was by car. And as the car got closer, I realized that I was surrounded by fewer and fewer normal cars. To the front, to the back, and immediately to the right of me, limousines. SUV-size limosines. I felt like a chemistry teacher tailing drunk students to senior prom. What should have been horror in this realization actually begat humor. It was clear I was about to walk into a madhouse. When I got out of the car and attempted to find will call, all I could do was find new lines of people. And each line was long, but none was the line I needed. Sometimes, as I got closer to another line of people — people who always looked younger than me, but weren’t always “young” — I would occasionally hear English being spoken. Typically, however, I didn’t. Because I knew this was a boy band, I expected the gender split to be about 90 percent female, 10 percent male. From what I’d seen, however, it was pretty close to 50-50. There was an excitement in the lines, but also a panic. Because this show was set to start at 8:00, it was 7:50, and there were probably a thousand people outside. Will call was a poorly marked door. And for some reason no one was going into this door, but a long line was positioned in front of it, waiting in the general admission line. Feeling the rush of adulthood and an obnoxious “I don’t wait in lines”–ness come over me, I walked right to that door, opened it, and confidently walked in. About 50 kids in line followed me, which caused mayhem inside. I turned around and gave the security lady an apology shrug as I went to get my ticket. By the time I’d entered, it was 8:05. I was told the show was starting exactly at eight, but its running late was welcome and not surprising. I needed a drink, and maybe two, and was happy to learn there was zero line for every alcohol kiosk in the arena, because teens. As I paid for my two very cold tallboys, I heard the first arena-wide shriek. It was showtime. Turning to look for a stairwell, I was almost knocked over by a crew of eight teens racing to their seats. Their faces weren’t filled with joy but with terror — the terror of missing a second of BigBang. I felt bad for them but even worse for the hundreds of people still outside. Who knew when they were going to get in? When I asked a guard how to get to my seat, I was told to find the escalator. But I couldn’t find it, so I took the stairs — which led me to the wrong floor, which was probably why she told me to take the escalator. As I stood on the wrong floor, however, I had a balcony-like vantage point on the entrance, which was an ebb and flow of people racing to their seats, screaming at the air. It was incredible. And then, just like that, a second arena-wide scream. It must have been song two. I needed to get to my seat — I didn’t come out to Newark to miss a concert, after all. When I made it up to the third level and walked into the arena, very little made sense.  The lights were mostly up, the room was half full, and, most importantly, no one was onstage. There was a music video playing and people were singing to it, but that didn’t add up to the insanity I heard as I wandered the halls of the Prudential Center. Two minutes later, when that music video ended, it all made sense. Another music video started and the place erupted, as if the five BigBang members were actually onstage. This increasingly filled room was freaking out over very large music videos. Because of course they were. Because this was a boy band, after all, and that’s what happens. It was almost as if I didn’t grow up on TRL and witness what happened when Brian and Kevin would walk up to the glass three floors up from the street and just look down, causing teens to scream, and then cry, and then faint. This was becoming a salvageable Saturday night. Five more music videos played, and each time, the reaction was the same when the music video began, but each time louder because by the fifth video, general admission was packed and the available seats were nearly filled. When the lights finally dimmed, they — we — were ready. It’s rare to find you’re in the middle of a phenomenon but have no idea what it is. Suddenly, it was pitch-black, and everyone down below had some sort of light source that they were ready to wave. And then the strobe lights appeared, followed by some second cousin of “Zombie Nation,” which I later learned was just BigBang’s first song of the evening, “Bang Bang Bang.”  Sitting there in awe for the next five minutes, I couldn’t get over the song, their live spectacle, their moves, the crowd, and the overall eccentricities of each member. ???  BigBang is made up of five members: T.O.P., Taeyang, Daesung, Seungri, and G-Dragon. All five are in their twenties, so none are actually boys. And you can tell that when you watch them perform, because they very much have the confidence of adults. But not in the “let me shed my boyish innocence” way (which would pertain to them, since they’ve been a unit since 2006). More in the “we’re fly, and we know that because we’ve been told that by little girls, grown women, little boys, and grown men, the end” sense. As a group, they have found a sizable amount of success, winning awards in Korea, Japan, and throughout Europe. In the United States, G-Dragon has had the most crossover appeal, but throughout Asia all five have found success beyond BigBang, be it in music, acting, or as personalities. As BigBang, all five can sing, all five can dance, and a few (most notably, T.O.P. and G-Dragon) rap. And they do all of these things very well. Three songs into the show, I was completely sold on BigBang. And I had 16 songs left. But as my interest increased, it wasn’t really because of the songs (only a few words throughout this show were in English, just to give some idea of how good things have to be when you don’t know what is being said at you). To put in plainly, it’s because they are the perfect boy band for 2015.  When it comes to boy bands, there are rules. And certain rules can never be broken, even if they are highly inefficient. One of those rules is that each member of the band gets a moment. Obviously, some bands have true stars and what ends up shaking out is a lead member and backup singers, but at some point, even the lowest member of the boy band totem pole gets some moment to do something. And not because of fairness for him — because even that last guy is someone’s favorite. And that fan paid good money to see their favorite have a moment in the sun. BigBang followed these rules, almost to a fault. On three occasions during the concert, a good 10 minutes was dedicated to each member walking up to the front of the stage, with the other four looking on, and giving the crowd similar prompts. “How are you, New Jerz?” “I Love Jerz.” “Make Some Noise” “I Love Your Energy” “You Give Us Energy” “Jerz” Even by the fifth iteration of this, the fans did not tire. And that’s because BigBang is at equal strength at each position. It’s terrifying how good each member is. It’s like the ’92 Dream Team starting five, but with unlimited R1 turbo. When you watch it for the first time, you want to immediately think of the Backstreet Boys or ’N Sync or Boyz II Men or New Kids on the Block or New Edition, but none is the right comparison. If BigBang has one evolutionary ancestor, it’s most certainly the Floaters.  You see, the Floaters are not the greatest boy band/man group of all time, but “Float On” might be the most beautiful creation a group of four to five boy-men with equal talent have ever made. It’s a simple song, with each member getting a verse of equal length, with the “Float, Float On” hook between each. But as each begins his verse, he alerts the world to his astrological sign, followed by his name, followed by what he offers the world (and how he wants to take you to Love Land). First, Ralph. Aquarius and my name is Ralph
Now I like a woman who loves her freedom
And I like a woman who can hold her own
And if you fit that description, baby, come with me
Take my hand, come with me, baby, to Love Land
Let me show you how sweet it could be
Sharing love with me, I want you to Second, Charles Libra and my name is Charles
Now I like a woman that’s quiet
A woman who carries herself
Like Miss Universe
A woman who would take me in her arms
And she would say, Charles, yeah
And if you fit that description
This is for you especially Third, Paul. Leo and my name is Paul
You see I like all women of the world
You see to me all women are wild flowers
And if you understand what I’m sayin’
I want you to
Mmm, take my hand
Come with me, baby, to Love Land
Let me show you how sweet it could be
Sharing love with me, I want you to The first three are great. And some people’s person is Paul or Charles or Ralph. I know this because I have aunts. The fourth verse, however, while not enough to overwhelm the other three, is admittedly a standout. It’s Larry. Cancer and my name is Larry, huh
And I like a woman
That loves everything and everybody
Because I love everybody and everything
And you know what, ladies,
If you feel that this is you
Then this is what I want you to do
Ooh, yeah, take my hand
Let me take you to Love Land
Let me show you how sweet it could be
Sharing your love with Larry, listen To be fair, G-Dragon is probably Larry from the Floaters. But in the same way Paul, Ralph, and Charles are also beloved and not far behind (and the favorites of many in their own right), so are T.O.P. and Taeyang and Daesung and Seungri. I know this because I watched and listened to the individualized screams from their constituencies, whenever it was their time to make a statement, rap a verse, do a dance move, be the center of attention.  This equal spread of adoration and talent and style that BigBang has is what makes them a great boy band. But what makes their presence perfect in this moment is that they buck one of the main tenets of boy band-dom: the crutch that is choreography. Let it be known: BigBang certainly has choreography. And when they do it, it is clean and sharp and very appreciated. But when BigBang really gets going on a song, they are not front and center, doing the same moves. They are covering surface area, doing their own moves, dripping with their own concoction of indivudualized swagger, each living his best life off in his own corner of the stage. It was truly a sight to see — a boy band that in reality is a supergroup. In one song, you have G-Dragon doing the nae-nae, T.O.P. calmly standing with his cane holding court, Taeyang running up a catwalk in a manic way, Daesung jumping up and down, and Seungri off doing moves with the background dancers. Whichever caught your eye, you were suddenly looking at the coolest guy in the room and the most talented guy in the band. Watching it, I understood why their audience was made up of people who could only dream of being them or being with them. And as they went through their catalogue, doing both group BigBang songs and solo numbers, hopping from rap to R&B to pop to EDM to dubstep to a country-esque ditty to a song that I swear could be the no. 1 Christian rock song in history (“Wings,” the solo song by Daesung), they found a way to be everything. They found a way to make it seem like Drake, Usher, Katy Perry, and Taylor Swift concerts all in one night. It was quite a sight to behold. As I walked out of the show, I didn’t know what to do. Standing with a group of friends and fellow music writers, I began to word vomit excitement. As I spoke, one response to my excitement was this: If you think they’re good, you also have to hear the new BigBang, Teen Top. I was disgusted. I didn’t want to hear that. I wasn’t ready to “explore the genre” right now. I was #BigBangHive now, and I wanted nothing more than to embrace this moment, this show, these men, this perfect Saturday night.",2015-10-14T10:05:40+00:00,Music,Browne
62,Genius: A Conversation With ‘Hamilton’ Maestro Lin-Manuel Miranda,"This morning, the MacArthur Foundation announced its annual “genius grant” recipients. Playwright, composer, singer, rapper, and Washington Heights native Lin-Manuel Miranda was among the 24. The 35-year-old is currently on his second tour of turning Broadway on its head. His first, the musical In the Heights, which he composed and starred in, won four Tony Awards in 2008, including Best Musical, and a Grammy for Best Musical Show Album. It was a 2009 nominee for the Pulitzer Prize in Drama. Now he has delivered Hamilton, a musical based on the life and death (spoiler) of Alexander Hamilton, his decades-long feud with Aaron Burr, and, in turn, the birth of the United States. Like Hamilton himself, the reality of Broadway is that if your show is going well, you’re always doing that show. Catching Lin-Manuel when he’s not performing is a tough task. In mid-September, between a 2 p.m. matinee (in which his understudy, Javier Muñoz, played the lead)1 and an 8 p.m. show in which he would perform, we met at the Richard Rodgers Theatre. We spoke twice. The first time was in his dressing room as he ate the grocery store sushi that you get in the plastic case and which you always hope was made that day. After half an hour, he departed for his daily duties in the Hamilton lottery outside the theater. Dubbed “Ham 4 Ham,” it’s a beautiful, insane display of fandom, with people putting their names in a hat to get an opportunity to see the biggest show in town. Half an hour later, after the crowd had dispersed, we sat alone in the seats that he looks out on every night. It’s been interesting watching Hamilton become “a thing” beyond the crowd that follows Broadway. When I saw the show, Lenny Kravitz and Lee Daniels were sitting across from me — at first they were chill, but by the second act they were completely into it. That was wild for me to see. I’m sure it also is for you — not only seeing them after the show, but seeing them while you’re performing. So, the scariest show we have done — and it’s all been easy since then — was three weeks at the Public Theater. Busta Rhymes is in the front row. Listen, this is an unapologetic love letter to hip-hop. [Rappers] didn’t come see In the Heights. A couple people did, Run-D.M.C., a few other old heads that love the genre in any form — they came. I was so nervous, [Busta] was in the front row, he took a redeye to get there. And I remember we were doing “My Shot,” and back at the Public, it was literally a “Pass the Courvoisier” line — it was, “Rise up, don’t this shit make my people wanna rise up” — and I saw him go [mimics big smile] and whisper to Riggs [Morales, a longtime record label A&R]. My feet are off the ground I’m rapping so hard because, you know, I got into a fistfight to get the last copy of “Scenario” when I was 13 years old. It’s the only fistfight I’ve ever been in in my life. I was like, Don’t look at Busta, don’t look at Busta. Then I look into the second row and Mandy Patinkin is sitting above Busta Rhymes. If there is a Busta Rhymes of musical theater, it probably is Mandy Patinkin. And it was just fucking crazy, when the people you’ve emptied your pockets to see are seeing you. It’s a crazy feeling. It’s both ennobling and totally humbling and totally terrifying. But after Busta, everything was cool. Les Misérables is playing next door to the Richard Rodgers Theatre. I know you love Les Mis. It was my first show. It’s not just that you have a show on Broadway — if you literally take a step back on the street, your show and Les Mis, the show that helped mold who you are, are on the same block. The things that you can see in Hamilton that are affecting people are also present in Les Mis. One, it’s trying to capture so much of the human experience that even if we fall short, we’ve got a lot of it. I mean, Les Misérables starts in prison. It’s “Look down, look down, you’re standing in your grave.” And then it goes up from there. And in terms of musical theater, it’s the opposite of what most people’s prejudices with musical theater is: It’s not sunny and uplifting. I think that’s why it struck such a universal chord with people. This is not happy show tunes. The one they do give you, it’s prostitutes. And it comes with this ironic twist. It’s like a masterclass in how to use themes in order to take a short circuit to someone’s tear duct or heart or gut. You see Valjean at the end and they play that music that was playing when Fantine died and it’s like, we know what’s coming — OH SHIT. “NOW YOU ARE HERE.” — NO, FUCK FUCK FUCK. [Mimics wiping away tears from his eyes.] Like, we just know. And it’s a masterclass. So those are the things that I always responded to. There’s just so much in it, it’s such a full meal. I have so much fun quoting Les Mis to Twitter and shit, because I could do it forever. There’s literally a line for every occasion. It hits everything. The musicals that leave us kind of staggering on our feet are the ones that really reach for a lot. And so, we’re trying to do that. Backstage in Miranda’s dressing room at the Richard Rodgers Theater. In the Heights came out at an important time for me — 2008, the recession, terrified to leave college in this climate, not knowing what to do with my life. I knew I wanted to write, but then saw the show and felt like there was the option to create something. In The New Yorker, you mentioned two things that kind of showed you the light. One was Rent. Rent was the show that made me want to write. Or that showed me you’re allowed to write. And the other, your going to Wesleyan, taught you that you could write about (or even talk about) where you’re from.  I got into Hunter [College] Elementary when I was 6 years old. So already, it’s like, they call me Lin at school and Lin-Manuel at home. It’s also super stark when there’s another language involved. I speak Spanish at home and English at school. And I’ve had all white Jewish friends from the time I’m 6 years old. I saw Rent, I loved writing musicals, but the first two musicals I wrote in high school, they sound like Rent. There’s no Latin anything in them. It wasn’t out of shame or embarrassment, I just didn’t bring anything from home to what I was writing. It was just like, “This is for high school and I’m writing about high school shit.” So one of them was about an unchaperoned party and I think I gave one of the kids a Latino last name. But they were all white Jewish kids playing the parts in the show. And then I lived in a Latino program house my sophomore year at Wesleyan. It was called La Casa. It was such a dope house; you had to write an essay to get in about why you were a Latino community leader, and that was the first time — this was my version of your experience — there were kids whose parents owned bodegas, and there are kids whose parents were both Wesleyan alums and they always knew they were going to Wesleyan and they’re Latino, but they’ve got the code switch down easy like I do. And it was inspiring — like, we could make a Marc Anthony joke before the English-speaking world knew about Marc Anthony, and it was also coinciding with when Ricky Martin did “Cup of Life.” It was the Latin pop boom, suddenly Marc Anthony is singing in English, Enrique Iglesias was a thing — I was figuring out these things about myself at the same time that the world was figuring out that we had something of value to offer, musically. Oh, look at you guys. These were some of the perfect storms that led to In the Heights. One of the other parts was The Capeman, which was going to be the great brown moment in musical theater, and it lived and died my senior year of high school. I was directing West Side Story; I wanted a life in this business. And there was this show written by fucking Paul Simon, starring Marc Anthony and Ruben Blades, two of my heroes — it just came and went. And it was us as gang members in the ’50s, again. It’s like, two musicals about Latinos and they’re both about the same fight. And so a part of me was just fueled off of that — we should be able to be onstage without a knife in our hand. Once. So that was a big creative fire. The other real shit was that my high school girlfriend and I were still dating and we should have broken up like two years prior. And she suddenly went to study abroad, and then I had all this fucking time and angst about where we were and what we were doing. So there was this sad love story that took place in Washington Heights and I used hip-hop and I used the same cocktail that ended up in the final product. It was this love story about these two people who could never be together, because that’s what I was going through in my head. And so all of that formed to help make that first draft of In the Heights. I’ll never forget, there’s a scene when Usnavi [played by Miranda] and Benny [Christopher Jackson] are freestyling on the street and they’re rapping and looking out and seeing the audience physically go like this [mimics perking up]. Yes, they liked the show, it was well received at Wesleyan, but I saw a physical reaction on the hip-hop numbers. And was like, Oh, this is some new shit. I remember seeing In the Heights, but I also remember that in-between period. Living in the Village, going to Le Poisson Rouge to see your group Freestyle Love Supreme perform. But by 2012, I remember beginning to think, with regard to you, Was that it? And I know if I thought that, there had to be some extent to which you thought or felt that. Because so much of In the Heights is that classic first-album thing, where you put your entire life into that first thing, and then it’s like — so do you have anything left to say? I was pretty Zen about it, honestly. Well one, I had the idea for Hamilton when I was still in In the Heights. So, again, impossible to overstate: The success of In the Heights gave me a life as a writer, a career as a writer, it said, “You belong here.” Nothing will ever do for me what that show did — from broke to not broke — in every respect. But you actually felt like you belonged on Broadway? So that’s the interesting thing: When my wife and I got married in 2010, we went on our honeymoon and — again — I have the idea for Hamilton, and I wrote the King George song on our honeymoon without a piano around, and then when I got back from our honeymoon our producers were like, the show’s closing. So that was the starter pistol of Oh shit, I won’t have a show running on Broadway, which was my steady source of income. But at the same time, I was a big film buff growing up. And the book whose advice I really followed concerning that “first album-ness” of Heights was Robert Rodriguez, Rebel Without a Crew. And he said, “Just don’t let them know what your sophomore project is.” And he just went and did a bunch of random shit. He did Four Rooms. And he did a Showtime movie. And he did so many random little things that people couldn’t just say, “Well, when’s your next movie?” So I did this West Side Story translation. I cowrote the Bring It On musical. And I did each one — it was never in my soul and bones to write a musical about cheerleading. But I knew I’d learn a lot watching Andy [Blankenbuehler] direct and writing with Tom [Kitt], who to me is one of the best melodists of our generation. Watching him think through an idea and see it go through his filter — it was like, Oh, I’m going to learn some moves. It was a way to stay sharp. That, absolutely, but just learning new shit. I had to write backward for Bring It On, because Andy was so specific about the tempos of the songs he wanted. I’d start with the tempo, I’d start with BPM, and he would be like, “ca-ca-ca-ca-ca, ca-ca” and I would write that down, and then build a song backward from the rhythm, as he had it in his head. Which was great, because now I know how to do that. I knew I had Hamilton in my pocket and I knew I needed to focus and time to get it done, and that was the hard part, because I have a family and I’m trying to support them. Yeah, it’s hard to just stop. But Do No Harm was like a writing residency for me. It was a bad NBC show and I was sixth on the call sheet and I took the job because I was like, it shoots in Philly and you’re going to be killed off in the 11th episode. So it was like signing a potential seven-year contract, which I was not interested in doing or going to L.A. I wanted to have time to write. I would have days free in Philly to write. NBC Miranda in ‘Do No Harm.’ Even before you’d finished Hamilton, were you already writing a character with Chris Jackson in mind? He was always George Washington. He’s just got that moral authority. He had it as Benny. In the beginning, someone was like, “Why do you have Chris playing this Lothario? Chris is so much more interesting than the character you’re writing.” So once we started writing for Chris, it became this R&B sound within the Latino thing, and it totally elevated the character. So this time I started with Chris. We didn’t know if Chris was going to do it, but it was going to have Chris’s skill set. You’re going to be able to spit and then sing an R&B ballad, like he’s this mash-up of Common and John Legend, fused into one person. A reality of this musical is that there are many standout characters that are not your character. People come away from it raving about Daveed Diggs’s portrayal of Thomas Jefferson.  That’s most people. Like, maybe he did Thomas Jefferson better than the actual Thomas Jefferson. And Leslie Odom Jr. as Aaron Burr. I stupidly gave him a lot of the best songs. Just layups. “Wait for It” and “The Room Where It Happens” are two of the best songs I’ve ever written in my life and he got them both. It doesn’t feel like the Alexander Hamilton show, as in you and some background singers.  I don’t know how to do that. Heights wasn’t like that either. Usnavi is the narrator, but he’s offstage a lot of the time. I honestly think it’s because school plays were my way into theater. I think I’m always subconsciously trying to write the ideal school play. Lots of parts for everybody, great parts for women — don’t forget, more girls try out than boys in the school play; everyone gets to be in the school play. When this gets done in high schools, they probably won’t double the parts. So you’ll have two different actors to play. I think it has an enormous amount of resonance to double the way we’ve doubled, but it’s a way to get more people in the school play. But it’s interesting: With Heights, we studied Fiddler on the Roof a lot. That’s the best way to introduce an audience to a community that’s ever been written. So what can we learn from that? And there’s a lot of similarities between our opening number in Heights. With Hamilton, it’s not about a community. In the abstract, it’s about the creation of America, but it’s about this fucking one guy who just blazes through. Born, keeping score, and counting time. So we studied Sweeney Todd a lot. And we studied Gypsy a lot. Shows where the structure is, there’s one fucking character and they’re a life force and you’re either an obstacle or you’re a friend but get the fuck out of the way. But at the same time, it’s so much fun to get to write about these people we think we know, because they were in a history book. And be like, oh yeah — Jefferson’s going to be dressed like Morris Day. And that’s all Paul [Tazewell]. The leaps they took from the music into the other departments are so incredible. I grinned so hard when I saw Andy’s staging for this at first, and they introduced Jefferson and he’s walking down the staircase and everyone’s scrubbing the floor. They got it, before I even had to say anything. Like, yep — there’s Jefferson, talking eloquently about freedom while a slave shakes his hand and he goes like this [looks disgusted]. That’s Jefferson, write more eloquently about freedom than anybody, but didn’t live it. There are some artists — Kanye West stands out — who treat music secondarily to telling stories and changing people’s perceptions of things and fucking with people’s heads. But even if you hear him describe his music, he talks about it like paintings. It’s visual for him. Which I found really interesting. I saw some interview with him where he was talking about creating the beats and he’s like, “I’m making a painting here.” When it comes down to it, if you had to pinpoint one thing, is it making musicals? Is it telling stories? Is it filling in the gaps of American and New York history? Is it being part of a musical theater lineage that connects you to people like Sondheim and Hammerstein? Well, I’ve learned an enormous amount from that lineage, quite literally. Getting to work with [Stephen] Sondheim. Getting to talk to [John] Kander. Getting to talk to Sheldon Harnick. These are the guys that do it the best. That’s the thing the theater affords you. I don’t think Hollywood really affords you that, or even music. Because everyone kind of works in their own world. There’s a Nashville world, there’s an Atlanta world, there’s an L.A. world. But everyone that’s the best at this works in these blocks. These 15 blocks. And so I’ve been the beneficiary of an enormous amount of knowledge from that. I’ll tell you, the person I talk to the most about the show is John Weidman, who wrote the book to Assassins and Pacific Overtures. And I have emails to him where I’m like, “I’m getting lost in the research and I feel like I’m fucking drowning.” And he was super encouraging. And I think that’s just true of musical theater. I talk about this with Tommy [Kail, the director of Hamilton] a lot. Directors don’t ever get to work together. Like, there can be collegiality, but they’re all up for the same gigs. I can’t write Next to Normal. I can’t write Fiddler. It wouldn’t come out of me like that. And I also think because composers know they have to collaborate for the theater, composers for the theater are among the most generous creative artists I’ve ever met. Because there’s no competition between me and Bobby Lopez, you give us the same assignment, we’re going to write two totally different things. So we could just be friends and talk about that shit. And so, I find it a very welcoming world. And a world to learn from. That being said, there’s other shit I want to write. It’s interesting, I think of it as, What’s the thing that’s not in the world that should be in the world? Heights is very much like, there should be a show with Latino people where we aren’t gang members and drug dealers, because that’s been super well represented already. We’re good on that. What’s the other thing? With this, I read that book [Alexander Hamilton by Ron Chernow] and it was such a perfect marriage of form and subject, and it was like, this music is the only way you can tell this guy’s story. You could do a Les Mis–type musical about Hamilton, but it would have to be 12 hours long, because the amount of words on the bars when you’re writing a typical song — that’s maybe got 10 words per line. Whereas here we can cram all this shit in all the margins. One of the last things I wrote for the show was one more fast rap for Lafayette, before he hands off a letter. Because I had Daveed. And he’s just the fucking best. And there was an opportunity. It was just them vamping, like, “Get your right-hand man back, unh, get your right-hand man back [scratches].” And it was like, no — we will fill that with stuff. It’s like Mad Magazine, where Sergio Aragonés is drawing cartoons in between the cartoons. There’s a lot of that in the show. I could just fill it with everything I think I know and the story allows that because it’s such a rich story. So, OK, I’m going to write a “Peter Piper”–type rap for “Washington on Your Side” and have them all trading back and forth, yeah. It allowed me to make a paella because it’s so rich. One of the great buried ledes is how it does come back to New York, how it comes back uptown.  A detail that I couldn’t get into the show. It ends with Eliza [Hamilton] and it’s all about her 50 years alive after Hamilton died. Something else: Eliza established the first school in Washington Heights. Really? Yeah. And we had a line. And I put it in, where it was like “the first school” — and they went, in Washington Heights. I took the melody from my own shit in In the Heights, but it was just too on the nose. You just can’t. Even though it’s historically true, I can’t actually say “in Washington Heights” at the end of my fucking show. But it was there to be mine. You didn’t even make it up. So imagine, I’m reading this book. And then I read that in the closing chapter. It was a confirmation — I was supposed to do this. I did find it fascinating that one of the artists you’ve cited as a musical influence, and you can hear it from time to time, is Outkast. For me, Outkast did what both Rent and Wesleyan did for you: They taught me I could write and that I could write about home. Part of my job is to tell a story about my home when I’m not there. Because once you leave, you become a representative of what a lot of people know about a place, and people are going to take cues about a place off of what they get from me. You’re an ambassador. They gave a lot of people that confidence to do that about their home. That’s part of their arc. They’re our Lennon and McCartney. They’re hip-hop’s Lennon and McCartney. Down to the double album where they each do one thing, which was like the “White Album.” And you’re just grateful that they did shit together as long as they did. I’ve always treated everything we’ve gotten in recent years as playing with house money. Just grateful for anything. I remember one of my best friends from high school played me Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik, when I was too young to even fully absorb it. What I knew was all East Coast hip-hop. And nothing else would go into my brain, like, my body rejected it, was like “I don’t know what this is.” I literally don’t understand what’s happening, didn’t process it. And then Aquemini came out my freshman year of college. And it was the soundtrack of college. And then by Stankonia, it was all I listened to. This may be a tangent, but I think about Andre 3000’s verses on all these random songs as these little orphans. Like someone needs to put them together. Like, “Sixteen” on the Rick Ross album is the most incredible thing I’ve ever heard in my life: “while I’m jelly beans descending / into the palms of a child,” like what the fuck is even happening? And it’s hiding inside a Rick Ross song. And “Walk It Out.” And “Pink Matter.” How did you decide to essentially make Hamilton without dialogue? We actually went down the road with a playwright. There’s a version of Act 1 where we had songs and they were the songs that are in the show, but we found that if you start with our opening number, you can’t go back to speech. The ball is just thrown too high in the air. So then the challenge for me became, how do I write scenes that still have this hip-hop feel? And that’s when I would listen to “Friend or Foe” by Jay Z on a loop. And like, most people if they’re writing hip-hop for theater, think it needs to sound a certain way. And that’s where growing up with hip-hop actually comes in handy, because we know it contains everything. I can write the most conversational, Reasonable Doubt–era Jay-Z: “Don’t do that, you makin’ me nervous / my crew, well, they do pack / them dudes is murderers.” That level of conversationalism is what you’re trying for in the scenes. But then there’s the songs that are heightened. Something that happens so often with minority figures, in the arts or otherwise, is this sense of responsibility. Have you wrestled with that? I’m sure you felt it in In the Heights, too. I did, and I got pitched every Latin-themed anything that was coming from anywhere. So, we’re not Hollywood actors, in that we do the thing once and then we hope they like our movie in a year. We’re chefs. And not like Raekwon, like we got a five-star review and you’re coming to see our show tonight and we’ve got to cook the same meal for you that we cooked for the critic that gave us the five-star review. It has to keep going, and it keeps you humbled. I’m drinking this shit that’s fucking terrible with parsley and lemon and ginger and swiss chard, because it’s good for me. Because you have to keep making the meal. Just the work of that is humbling. But the relaxing two hours and 45 minutes of my day or spent during the show, because I’m not supposed to be doing anything else but that. Everything else is crazy. Good crazy or bad crazy? Just, Gerard Butler standing next to Justice Kennedy crazy. It’s famous person Mad Libs. Every night is Mad Libs. But also, you don’t ever want to get used to it or take it for granted. You want to be pinching yourself the whole time. There was a rapper that was supposed to be coming — not going to give his name up because he’ll come eventually. Anyway, they were trying to get him in, it was tough to get him a ticket, I helped get him a ticket, I literally kicked a friend out. And then he didn’t show. And I found out like 15 [before the performance]. And I spent the opening number pissed off. I can’t fucking believe I kicked my friend out for this rapper, and then I was like, “I don’t ever want to be the guy who is in my hit Broadway show and mad because the most fam— one of the most famous rappers ever isn’t there. I have to get that shit out of my system. Check your priv. It was the ultimate check my priv. I almost got hit with a chair [during] the number and I was like, “OK, check your privilege.” I can’t be in that headspace and make this thing. So doing the show keeps you honest, keeps you humble and focused and grounded. This interview has been condensed and edited. This post has been updated to correct one name and clarify another. Tom Kitt composed the music for Bring It On, and Tommy Kail is the director of Hamilton.",2015-09-29T17:17:46+00:00,Theater,Browne
63,"#Holywatergate: The Theft of a Pope’s Beverage Rocks Washington, D.C.","Sometimes the Internet completely lets you down. And then you have to do things to make the Internet aware of your disappointment with the hope that it never happens again. Last week, His Holiness Francis, Bishop of Rome, Vicar of Jesus Christ, Successor of the Prince of the Apostles, Supreme Pontiff of the Universal Church, Primate of Italy, Archbishop and Metropolitan of the Roman Province, Sovereign of the Vatican City State, Servant of the servants of God made a trip to the United States, beginning in Washington, D.C. When His Holiness Francis, Bishop of Rome, Vicar of Jesus Christ, Successor of the Prince of the Apostles, Supreme Pontiff of the Universal Church, Primate of Italy, Archbishop and Metropolitan of the Roman Province, Sovereign of the Vatican City State, Servant of the servants of God arrived in the nation’s capital (unclear if by BoltBus or Megabus; awaiting confirmation, check back for updates over the course of the year), he first went to the White House to meet with the First Family, followed by a parade, the midday prayer, and Mass at the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception. Things were going great for HHFBORVOJCSOTPOTASPOTUCPOIAAMOTRPSOTVCSSOTSOG, until his next stop: Congress. The “Pope” (as some lazily refer to him) was set to address both houses of Congress. And then he did just that. As he walked out, most of the room’s attention was focused on Pope Francis, since he’s the Bishop of Rome, Vicar of Jesus Christ, Successor of the Prince of the Apostles, Supreme Pontiff of the Universal Church, Primate of Italy, Archbishop and Metropolitan of the Roman Province, Sovereign of the Vatican City State, Servant of the servants of God. All but one person:  He used to be known simply as Representative Bob Brady from Pennsylvania. That was until, like a villain in a Scooby-Doo episode, he used the diversion of “Pope” to steal the drinking glass used by His Holiness Francis, Bishop of Rome, Vicar of Jesus Christ, Successor of the Prince of the Apostles, Supreme Pontiff of the Universal Church, Primate of Italy, Archbishop and Metropolitan of the Roman Province, Sovereign of the Vatican City State, Servant of the servants of God. Bob did that. And then he kept going. Stan White/U.S. Rep. Bob Brady’s Office Yes, he took it back to his Congressional Office Hideout, drank from it, and then passed it around like he got a free bottle of coconut Ciroc at the club.  This is not why we’re here, however. I couldn’t care less about Congressman Bob Brady and what he steals. Or what he said was an approved steal. Or that he claims he’s going pay for it. Or that he admitted to His Holiness Francis, Bishop of Rome, Vicar of Jesus Christ, Successor of the Prince of the Apostles, Supreme Pontiff of the Universal Church, Primate of Italy, Archbishop and Metropolitan of the Roman Province, Sovereign of the Vatican City State, Servant of the servants of God that he did it. My concern is the degree to which this story was covered, ad nauseam, without bringing up the obvious origin story to his nefarious ways. Most stories reporting on his heist eventually were like, This isn’t the first time Brady has robbed someone more important; he also took Obama’s glass at his first inauguration. That’s cool and all, but again, it’s not the story. When one speaks of “Pope” and “theft,” only one thing should pop into your mind:  It’s the 12th episode of the seventh season of The Golden Girls. Titled “The Pope’s Ring,” the episode centers around Sophia stealing Pope John Paul II’s ring during his visit to Miami. As you remember, Sophia and Dorothy have two tickets to the papal Mass, and Dorothy’s super excited, but then Sophia comes in and tells her she traded their two terrible tickets for one really good ticket just for her, so she can be closer to the Pope and ask him to bless her friend Agnes. Blanche, hearing the story, is skeptical that Sophia will be able to get the Pope’s attention, until Sophia says she thinks she’ll get the Pope’s attention pretty easily.  Later in the episode, Sophia returns home from Mass and shows off a new collector’s item: Pope John Paul II’s ring. Dorothy doesn’t believe it’s real, but Sophia assures her it’s legitimate (“You think he’d wear his fakes in public like Zsa Zsa?”). Dorothy needs the full story, so Sophia sets the scene. She’s at Mass, and then sneaks into the handicapped section. When the Pope arrives, he comes to that section and she bends down to kiss his ring. As she’s going to kiss it, security comes and takes the Pope away. And then she tells Dorothy, “He leaves the ring behind, as a memento.”  Dorothy, knowing her mom very well, follows up with the only appropriate response: “Mom, you stole the Pope’s ring?”  Sophia doesn’t want to give it back, suggesting that maybe it’s a sign and further wondering if perhaps her having the ring would get her into the Bible. Dorothy’s not having it, and tells Sophia she has to return it. Before Sophia gives it back, she tries to test out its powers, waving her hand over a glass of water, seeing if it would turn into wine, and then when it doesn’t, saying “Worth a shot.” The next time we see Sophia, it’s when she walks into the kitchen, crashing a typical Golden Girls late-night chat session. Her question to the group: “This may not be a good time, but has anyone seen a large jewel-encrusted ring that’s steeped in history just lying around lately?” Sophia lost the Pope’s ring, which is certainly the only thing worse than stealing the Pope’s ring. Dorothy helps Sophia look for the ring, and then has a weird hunch something is up. Questioning her mother, she suddenly threatens to flip her upside down and shake her and see what falls out of her pockets. At that point, Sophia pulls the ring out of her pocket. Sophia lied about losing the Pope’s ring so she wouldn’t have to return it, which is even worse than losing the Pope’s ring or stealing the Pope’s ring. Ultimately, Sophia’s absolutely blasphemous ways end, as she returns the ring to a priest, and then her friend Agnes actually gets a blessing from Pope John Paul II (played by Eugene Greytak, who also portrayed Pope John Paul II in Night Court, ALF, Sister Act, Murphy Brown, Naked Gun 33 1/3, Ally McBeal, and The Wayans Bros.). He visited the hospital that Agnes was staying in and gave her the blessing that Sophia sorely wanted, the thing behind all of her scheming ways. She’s a lot like Congressman Brady, except she does it for her dear friends and he robs Popes for his mantle of thievery. There is no moral to this story — I’m simply disappointed that our country’s foremost political bloggers don’t watch enough Golden Girls. That’s all. Good day.",2015-09-28T17:14:35+00:00,Papal Affairs,Browne
64,"Hpnotiq, a Love Story: One Man’s Epic Journey to Rediscover Hip-Hop’s Most Notorious Blue Liquor","The following is a love ballad, a cautionary tale, a story of what happens when a resurrected icon meets a soon-to-be champion. ??? “WHAT UP,” I scream into the phone. “Um, hi, I’m outside with your package,” the nervous voice responds. “Oh, sorry. Hey, coming right out.” There is absolutely no reason for me to yell into the phone. I don’t know the number that called, but it has a 404 area code — my area code — and something about that made me overly comfortable with this stranger. I run outside, get the package, and come back inside. It’s two bottles of Hpnotiq. Yes, I’ve had Hpnotiq delivered to me via UberRUSH on the first school night of the workweek. In 2015. In 2004, I’m sure this would not have raised an eyebrow — ordering a delivery of this refreshing blend of premium French vodka, exotic fruit juices, and a touch of cognac on a Monday night was as common back then as going double platinum. But this is 2015, a full liquor generation past the height of the blue drink. I need this Hpnotiq, because something important is happening, right under my nose. Hpnotiq is trying to make Hpnotiq happen again.  Cam’ron, as a spokesman for Hpnotiq, in 2015. They’re actually trying to do this, for real. And I am absolutely here for it. Hpnotiq is throwing house parties where Cam’ron and other artists perform real-life Cam’ron and other artist sets, but in the name of Hpnotiq. That, too, I am here for. For years, I’ve had the idea to gather all of the mid-aughts lyrics centered on Hpnotiq and celebrate them in all their glory in the form of an Internet blog post. But it never came together, because it was potentially a piece about Hpnotiq roughly 10 years too late. But now that this glorious wormhole has presented itself, it’s time. If I’m going to do a deep dive on Hpno, though, I’ll need to become excruciatingly familiar with the beverage. “Know your subject,” as they say. The irony of my love and obsession with the drink is that Hpnotiq’s glory days were the years leading up to when I could legally drink. Had it been a consistent part of my life, I’m sure the allure would not be there. But Hpnotiq was the thing my friends and I wanted, because it was the thing we didn’t stop hearing about, and the thing we couldn’t readily have. This is a terrible idea.  That first sip of Hpnotiq is my breakfast. It’s over ice, and while it’s delicious, I can’t stop looking at the bottle. There is so much left. And the glow within the bottle is almost taunting me — daring me — to enter, like a bioluminescent bay in Vieques. I spent so much of my sub-21 years wanting to behave as my favorite rappers did, and now the moment is here. I thought I was ready, but maybe I’m not. For people of a certain age, the early 2000s were the greatest time to be alive. I was on the youngest end of the range for this generation, as I was comfortably in my high school years. When you’re in high school, you’re too young to do everything, which makes it the perfect age to try to do certain things and fantasize about other things. You’re not grown, but you think you’re so close to being grown that you’ll do anything to feel grown. The people you admire are older than you and they talk about things they’re doing, which resonates with you, because it’s all right outside your grasp. You couldn’t pay me a million dollars to relive a single day of it. I miss it so much. I’m starting to like it.  I know how deceiving a liquor bottle can be, but I don’t care. Looking at the Hpnotiq after my second mugful, I’m sure that I’m halfway done. This is easy, I think. I love Hpnotiq and Hpnotiq loves me. I am in such a good head and health space that I begin my deep dive into what I always felt was true, this period when rap couldn’t escape discussing the liquor. The truly amazing thing about Hpnotiq, and its glory days from 2003 to 2006, was that in 2000 it didn’t even exist. Its cultural rise went from its creation in 2001, to its owners bulldogging the drink into New York City clubs in 2002, to Fabolous having a sip of it in P. Diddy’s then-restaurant, Justin’s. The first time I remember taking note of the drink was on Fab’s landmark 2003 album, Street Dreams. Loso could not stop talking about Hpnotiq. In the current age of brands and “influencers,” words are rarely spoken unless work behind the scenes has taken place to perfectly curate a message. But this was 2003. And while official liquor placements in videos did eventually take place between the rapper and the drink, at least in the beginning it seemed as if Fab just really liked Hpnotiq. The following is all from one album: Uh, hold up Cain, uh, why wouldn’t I have samples of raw (uh huh)
In Akademik sample velours
Hpnotiq samples to pour
The European sample Azure
—”Why Wouldn’t I” I’m particularly picky
When it come to licky licky
Have ’em slidin’ off them Vickies quickly
Under the doo-rag thick three sixty
It’s the hypno and sticky icky
—”Not Give a Fuck” Ain’t no tellin’ what this hypno’ will do to me
I’m feelin’ like I can do what I want now
Dip-low immunity
—”This Is My Party” These lyrics spoke to me then, but they really speak to me now. Because at 12:52 p.m. I finally get it. If there is one phrase that sums up my current existence, as I crawl back under my office desk to pour a third glass of Hpnotiq, it’s “Ain’t no telling’ what this hypno’ will do to me.” All I can assume is that, most likely, it’ll be something great. Just following instructions.  On the back of a Hpnotiq bottle are instructions about how to best indulge in the beverage. And the scripture reads: Always serve chilled — on the rocks, straight, with vodka, rum, champagne, or added to martinis, margaritas, shooters, or your favorite cocktail for a unique twist. There wasn’t Vitamin Water Formula 50 in the early 2000s, but I assume they would have added this to the list. Because, lordamercy, this is a phenomenal creation I’ve made. Also, it’s relevant because if there’s someone who cared about Hpnotiq back in the old days (2006), it was 50 Cent. Now homie, I say I “run it run it” cause I’m in control
Hpnotiq, Hennessy, a couple shots of Patron I have you feeling aight
—“You Don’t Know” (Eminem song) 2006 was the tail end, however. People were still talking about it (most notably, Jeezy on “Go Getta,” the Game on “It’s Okay (One Blood),” Crime Mob on “Rock Yo Hips,” Lupe Fiasco [in a negative light] on a few occasions on Food & Liquor), but what happened between 2003 and 2005 made me think it was the only thing they served at these things called “clubs” that one day I would excitedly try to attend but then be denied entry. And it wasn’t just rappers. From a 2003 People:  Hpnotiq was spreading to the general celebrity public, even making its way into a Sex and the City episode. This mainstream acceptance was noteworthy, but the thing that continued to fuel the machine was still hip-hop and the liquor’s nonstop appearance in songs. A collection of the (non-Fabolous) greatest hits from 2003: Cause I’m the best that ever done it, the best that lived it
I ain’t no overnight success goddamnit I was born with it
The Prada mama, the Dolce and Gabbana drippin
The Blue Hpnotiq Martini Mimosa sippin
Y’all better team or get it together
Or you, you and her can get it whenever
—Lil’ Kim, “Came Back for You” She at the bar stylin’ she throwing it up
She drink a little hypno, throwing it up

—WC, “Gangsta Nation” (Westside Connection song) Gas, break, dip, stop, and go
Ride the strip, hit the sto
You know that I bought it, you know that I got it
Had to cop a bottle of the blue Hpnotiq
Incredible Hulks, you know what I mean
Mix it with some dark and watch that shit turn green
—E-40, “Act a Ass” Hpnotiq in my drink (that’s right!)
Shake ya ass till it stink (that’s right!)
Mr. Mos’ on the beat (that’s right!)
Put it down for the streets (that’s right!)
—Missy Elliott, “Pass That Dutch” I think I got a Hpnotiq
Drunk got me singin bout it
Back off in Cali like Cool J
Fresh on the scene with Sade
—Nappy Roots, “What Cha Gonna Do? (The Anthem)” My girls know who I be (true)
My girls like VIP (true)
And they like Hpno-I-C (Que)
And they ain’t tryin to show you ID (true)
—Kelis, “Milkshake (Remix)” After that we go to my room for the after, after party
Y’all know what happens next
Hpnotiq and a rated X
Got her singin’ the greatest sex
—R. Kelly, “Gangsta Girl” (Big Tymers song) Speaking of Robert Kelly, he really wanted people to know that he had Hpnotiq essentially on tap in 2003. He brought up the liquor again in “Snake (Remix),” which he performed at the 2003 BET Awards, dramatically beginning his set with the lyrics, “First we’re gonna pop open a bottle of the Hpnotiq / No more time waste, let’s get this party started.” One of the rappers on that remix? Cam’ron.  As they say, what a time to be alive. And now, finally — 12 years later — alone, from my desk at work, in the middle of the afternoon, I can really understand what they’re talking about. Things have gone terribly wrong.  I don’t know why I had sushi for lunch. Why on EARTH would I have sushi for lunch? Anyway, a word to the wise: Don’t eat sushi after your third cup of Hpnotiq. It’s almost 4 p.m. and I’m having trouble staying awake. I also have the chills. Also, I just got very warm. I wish I weren’t wearing a sweatshirt. I wish I were wearing a swimming pool. Also, I just asked someone how many Tums one can take in a 30-minute window, because my chest is on fire. Also, I think people are beginning to notice what I’m doing under my desk, because the last time I just stayed there for a while because my left eye started to tear up. I hope this espresso helps. I’m not mixing it with the Hpnotiq, I just need another stimulant to try to counteract all the blue gak running through my veins. Also, when I went outside to get the espresso, someone walked by and said “go rebels.” It’s really disarming for a white man to walk by black you and look you in the eyes and say “go rebels.” I think my Hpno instincts told me to swing on him, but then I looked down and saw I was wearing an Ole Miss sweatshirt. I think I still tried to trip him up. I think everyone in the office knows. People keep walking by my desk, looking at me, and not saying anything. I think there’s a mole in the office. Why is there so much Hpnotiq left? How did Twista do it? Twista loved Hpnotiq. I bet he still does. Look how much Twista loves Hpnotiq. Cuz I’m coming some pimp tight game
Iced out charm
Chromed out truck
Come through balling like I really don’t give a fuck
Blowing a fatty of the purple with the windows up
While I’m sipping on Hennessy and Hpnotiq getting stuck
—”Do U” (Do or Die song), 2003 Take the Hpno to the dome
Smokin when I’m rollin, wood on chrome
—”Rubberband Man (Remix)” (T.I. song), 2004 Girl you know you get me so erotic
Especially when I be sippin’ Hpnotiq
Got me feelin like I’m smokin on chronic
When we fuckin’ it be so exotic
—”So Lonely,” 2006 Give you Hpnotiq to get you erotic
And then I take you somewhere exotic
Where we can blow chronic
—”Diddy Rock” (Diddy song), 2006 I just had one of those bad burps. Help.  I’m fine, but something terrifying has happened and I don’t know what to do. I spilled a little Hpnotiq on the carpet because my Montessori pouring skills have begun to falter.  Two minutes later:  As I said earlier, help. I’m not sure if this rap lifestyle was ever for me. How did they drink so much of this drink in the mid-2000s? Some of my heroes would stop at no length to talk about the joys of mixing Hpnotiq and Hennessy, as if it were cheese eggs and cheese grits. I spent so many years yearning for this lifestyle, and now that I’m here, maybe it wasn’t for me from the beginning. Seriously though, people loved to mix Hpno and Henny. Especially in 2005. You don’t wanna run up on a n?-?-?-?- in the club
When I’m gone off that Hpnotiq, Henny, and that buzz
—Master P, “Yappin’” I hit the stage buckin’ hard, got the whole club rockin
Hennessy and Hpnotiq got me thinkin’ ’bout the projects
—Webbie, “Full of Dat Shit” One cup of Henny, one cup of Hpno
If you ran out of it, yo, you got to get more
—Kanye West, “Tim Westwood Freestyle” Towel under the door, we smoke until the day’s end
Puff puff and pass, don’t fuck up rotation
Hpnotiq for Henny? Now n?-?-?-?- that’s a chaser
—Kanye West, “We Major” I’ma hit the bar up, put some Henny in your cup
With the Hpno, girl you incredible, sexy
Two-way text me on the Blackberry
—Phoenix Orion, “Don’t Hurt Nobody” (Canibus song) And I’m chasin’ it down, with Henny and Hpno’
Two pulls and pass, you know how fast the weed go
—Tony Yayo, “I’m So High” There’s no Hennessy here, so that’s not really an option. But I think I know the next best thing. I’m baaaaaaaaack.  Introducing: The Wintertime Incredible Hulk. Ingredients: Hpnotiq (obviously) and a Lemon Zinger hot tea K-Cup from the office kitchen. Not only is the warmth soothing the chest pains that may never leave, it’s beyond tasty. I’m in an incredible mood. Pretty much everyone has left work, but I’m just hitting my stride. Just jumped into a little transcribing, and the Hamilton soundtrack has never sounded better. If you haven’t listened to Hamilton after finishing three-fourths of a bottle of Hpnotiq, you haven’t truly experienced the theater. In addition to 2005 being the year that people embraced the true power of the mix, it’s also the moment, perhaps, when Hpnotiq got too big for Hpnotiq. It was actually everywhere. A little-known rapper, Kendrick Lamar, named a song of his “Hpnotiq,” and he didn’t even reference it in the lyrics. It was just a good, cool thing to name the song. If you needed to discuss anything that was blue, Hpnotiq was the go-to metaphor (“My raps are chaotic, your face blue like Hpnotiq / Cause I’m a multi-millionaire who still using Ebonics” —Ludacris, “Family Affair”). The Syleena Johnson song “Hypnotic” wasn’t spelled like the liquor, but it was clear it was playing off the fame of the drink. The hook: Hypnotic, hypnotic, hypnotic (hypnotic), hypnotic
Hypnotic, so hypnotic
Your love is so hypnotic, hypnotic, hypnotic, (hypnotic), hypnotic
Hypnotic, so hypnotic (so hypnotic)
Your love is so (your love is so) Lines from the verses: R. Kelly: I’m like a pimp with a twist / Hpnotiq with the Cris’ Fabolous (yes, he’s back): The game is hypnotic, somethin like the blue drink / You see me on the hood, frontin’ with the blue minks. The cultural imprint of the liquor was so big, it was as if the only direction it could go was down. Which, unfortunately, is exactly what happened. It’s time to leave work. And I’m so close.  The day has been filled with ups and downs. With that said, I think I get Hpnotiq now. And I’m kind of glad that only on a few occasions could I get my hands on this as a kid. Because an entire bottle of this is not for kids. Really, if I’m being frank, an entire bottle on a Tuesday afternoon is probably only for myself and famous rappers. I get it so much that I’m convinced I don’t need to finish the last bit. So I decide that I’m done. Enough is enough. I decide to get in a cab, because I’m a little too self-conscious at the moment to get on the subway. This turns out to be a bad idea. Because this is when the city starts talking to me.  Seriously? Nike-fueled subliminal messaging telling me to do a chin-up and then have one more glass of Hpnotiq? Unreal. But it’s not over.  YouTube’s in on it too? What does this even mean, anyway? All I know is that I’m convinced it’s an ad pushing me in the direction of finishing this Hpnotiq. But it still isn’t done.  NO IT WASN’T, SUBLIMINALS FROM A BIG APPLE NIGHT OUT ON THE TOWN. EVERYTHING IS NOT GOING TO BE ALRIGHT. I can’t deal with this, being tormented for being a quitter. I know what I have to do: ask Siri.  Useless. It’s time to go home and handle this, once and for all. I’ve eaten dinner, gotten some air, had some very chatty conversations with cab drivers, but now it’s time. At some point, you have to be like, what would Twista do? What would Fab do? What would Lil’ Kim do? What would Kanye do? What would Crime Mob do? What would that guy who rapped on the Canibus song do? I know what all of them would do at a moment like this.  Finish the damn Hpnotiq, like a champion. So I do what all champions do: dig deep, find the strength you didn’t know you had, take out two ice cubes from the freezer, and let those final seven drops fall into your mug. One second later, it’s done.  On September 22, 2015, a child name Rembert Browne has finally become an adult. And to only one thing does he owe this achievement: the refreshing blend of blue stuff known as Hpnotiq. I’m so glad you’re back. To all the rappers old and new, it’s time to fire up the old Hpno metaphor machine. Today is a new day. And while it may be months before I can even look at that second bottle of Hpnotiq, to the rest of you, jump in. The water is premium, it’s French, and it’s chilled.",2015-09-24T12:42:38+00:00,Booze,Browne
65,"Songs of the Week: Bieber Peaking, Carly Rae Evolving, and Pharrell Making No Sense"," This is not a new song. But as of right now, this is the no. 1 rap song in the country. And that will probably be the case through 2017, so just get used to it. (Warning: If you are a stickler about high lyric content, this is your song, your moment, your Ben-Hur.)  Lifehack: If you go to Chipotle and do the “SILENTO” scream but replace it with “CILANTRO,” they’ll kindly ask you to leave the line.  This is a new song. This is a good song. We really don’t deserve a world where Bieber and Efron are peaking at the same time. What a perfect time to be alive or something.  This is a new song. And if imagining Russell Wilson’s haircut writing a five-minute musical about Anchorman 2 gives you the chills, you’ll probably like it.  This is not a new song. But it is a new cover. Good things happen when Solange and Dev work together.  This is a new video. This is a great video. I can’t stop watching this video. You should watch this video. It screams summer noooooo please don’t end noooooooooo, which I guarantee you need in your life right now.  This is not a new song. But this is a new video, a video I’m only partially convinced wasn’t shot on my roof. The video is filled with Future, still fully dialed into his Zorro look, Drake doing his cool kid hallway stumble dance, and THE COOLEST DJ IN THE WORLD, DJ ESCO.   This is not a new song. But I think I just finished my 50th listen of it, which is the moment you realize you have no idea what Pharrell is talking about. Lyrics that I’ve convinced myself are in this song: “Eat all the shrimp / shrimp go a float / float in the sea / race is a myth / live like a queen / eat like a bear / feed all the toads / hats on the shelf.”  This is a newish song. And whenever I turn on this song, I am a caterpillar. By the time the hook rolls around, however, I am a full-grown butterfly, walking on two legs, trying to find a bodega that sells loosies. LONG LIVE THE ANTISWIFT.  This is not a new song. But it is a from her new EP, Four Pink Walls. Cara is riding the wave that comes from associating yourself with a Drake song; in her case, a “Hotline Bling” cover.

66,Stem the Tidal: How Jay Z Is Trying to Gain the Trust of Fans (and Old Friends) All Over Again,"It’s not hard to feel indifferent about Jay Z these days. This is not ideal for Jay because the only thing worse than people disliking him is people not caring. Antipathy, while worrisome, at least carries with it some passion. Jay Z has built a career — an empire — on making people feel passionately about Jay Z. Year in and year out, Jay Z could be counted on to be talented, to be likable, and to be profitable. In this moment, all three are up for debate. This is a new chapter in Jay’s career arc: a time when things routinely don’t go his way, when people seem to take some satisfaction in watching him squirm. Whether it’s his tenure with the Brooklyn Nets, his client list at Roc Nation Sports, a telecommunication-corporation-sponsored album, domestic elevator whodunits, or his entrance into the streaming music wars, there’s admittedly something satisfying about watching him stumble, as normal humans do. And there’s something therapeutically twisted in targeting him — a mass bullying of the unbullyable — since he feels too big to feel, and to fail. Rarely does it seem malicious, the Jay pile-on, but there is a sense that he’s long overdue for a heat check. There has always been an idea that the pedestal upon which Jay sits — one we built for him — could not be toppled. That no matter how much one clowns Jay, criticizes Jay, puts pressure on Jay to use his powers for good, there a sense that he’s too high up to see the finger wags. Regardless of whether that’s true — and even it’s routinely stated that we may not see the good he does privately — the perception remains. And as his life becomes more closely aligned with the business of music rather than the music business, he will increasingly be viewed through a critical, unflattering, even occasionally distrusting lens. Jay Z’s most recently perceived slip-up turned public target practice comes by way of his ownership of the music streaming service Tidal, which has not had the most flattering roll-out. Tidal is 2015 Jay Z personified: easy to deem out of touch, the butt of many a joke, and potentially groundbreaking. So what’s a maybe-not-that-cool, maybe-out-of-touch, easily mockable Jay Z and Tidal to do?  It was an odd moment in the history of Jay Z. We’re not used to those who sit in thrones coming down to plead for acceptance — that is, unless a significant panic is in order. The act, oddly enough, was the humanized Jay that many people seemed to yearn for. But because this moment is also connected to Jay doing things that aren’t considered cool — defending a brand, corporate messaging — it was ultimately mocked. For the first time, it genuinely looked like Jay Z could not win. It’s a challenging world to navigate when you can’t be confident or humble, guarded or vulnerable. It was becoming painfully clear that this Tidal thing wasn’t going to work purely on the strength of Jay’s word or his taste. He needed help. Jay Z needed serious help. Enter: the B-sides.  The premise: two concerts for Tidal subscribers on back-to-back nights in New York City, starring Jay and his extensive back catalogue. The lesser-known songs. The tracks for the ever-romanticized day-one fans. The mere existence of this concert suggests that Jay knows, to some degree, that he can’t just make people do things anymore. Tidal will not benefit from the same “It’s cool because it’s mine — trust me” hypnosis that worked with, say, his early-2000s Rocawear clothing line. At this point in his career, he’s closer to an elected official. If he wants the support of his constituency, he’s going to have to work to prove he still deserves his seat. A concert his truest fans have always wanted? On the surface, it seems like a legitimate start. ??? The critique cycle of Jay (and the Carters, and black celebrities, and people with money, and anyone with the privilege of having a platform) is fair. Even the occasional pile-on is fair. Because the haves typically owe something to the have-nots — the rise of the haves is in large part due to the support of the have-nots. So when the have-nots feel as if the haves have forgotten a time when they were have-nots, the have-nots will remind them, publicly. This was true, in some part, after the first night of the B-sides concerts. The one thing I knew about Night 1, while preparing to attend Night 2, was the existence of a Jay “freestyle” in which he got “political.”  When Jay does anything that touches on a current issue, it will immediately be seen as good, bad, authentic, or fake, depending on the mood of the listener and their level of trust in the motives of 2015 Jay Z. Which explains the multitude of takes on Jay’s Saturday “freestyle,” one that included mentions of Spotify, YouTube, Mike Brown, and Freddie Gray in a 30-second span. The two overarching themes of the response: disgust (given the context) and pleasant surprise (given the context). These are the same conflicting yet coexisting questions concerning modern-day Jay: “Is he doing enough?” “Is he trying to do too much?” At Manhattan’s Terminal 5 for the second show, I was prepared for another one of these commentary-filled moments. This — even more than the premise of being treated to portions of around 40 Jay Z songs — was my focus, because this show, like Jay Z, was bigger than music. And it seemed as if this moment at this concert could ultimately shed light on whether Jay Z was falling further into the abyss of “Who does this guy think he is?” or beginning to trend up back toward “That’s still my guy.” ??? The only way we can continue in hip-hop is if we pay respect to the past. I had to pay respect to the past so I can continue on to the future. Can I introduce y’all to my future. ROC-A-FELLA RECORDS, GIVE ME SOMETHING, JUST. This is Jay, but not from 2015. This is 2003 Jay — peak rap icon Jay — during his “retirement” concert in Madison Square Garden, chronicled in the film Fade to Black.  In a show that was meant to be a celebration of the career of Jay Z, one of the night’s slight departures was the Roc-A-Fella interlude with Memphis Bleek, Freeway, and Beanie Sigel. It’s one of those moments in the film — like the three-song Beyoncé portion — that were welcome if not essential. But you also understood their inclusion, because both his then-girlfriend and his crew (and Jay’s verses with both) were important parts of his career. You understood it, but could also acknowledge them for what they were, favors — good looks, if you will — by Jay for people whose futures he was invested in. Look back at Jay, however, during the Roc Boys Fade to Black reunion: He’s elated. He is at his happiest on a stage. It’s the closest thing to Jay as a member of a group. Beans, Freeway, Bleek, — that’s his Destiny’s Child. And for the six-plus minutes that is “You, Me, Him & Her” and “What We Do” — a two-song live medley that is as good as any two-song live medley in rap history — they were a unified presence. One with a clear star, sure, but a unified front nonetheless. Everything clicked while they performed those two songs. Even if it was a favor, it sure didn’t feel like it on the part of Jay’s crew. What you saw in that moment were three hungry rappers, ready to carry the torch that Jay had handed them, for the foreseeable future. When the Roc reunited at Hammerstein Ballroom in 2007, things had changed. The gap between Jay and the rest had widened irreversibly. In 2003, Jay was still the guy, but the others were very much on the rise. By 2007, Jay’s success has grown exponentially, while the others were commonly thought of as rappers once closely associated with Jay Z, and little else. The result felt like an acceptance of “just happy to be here” for Beans, Bleek, Freeway, and the members of the Young Gunz. It was the prophesy from Jay’s charitable, factual, and rude lyric about Memphis Bleek fulfilled and now spreading to the entire Dynasty. Bleek could be one hit away his whole career
As long as I’m alive he’s a millionaire
And even if I die he’s in my will somewhere
So he could just kick back and chill somewhere  When they performed these two songs in 2007, it was still great — because these are great songs — but the fire had been extinguished. It felt more nostalgic than relevant, like seeing the Temptations shimmy on a cruise ship in the 1990s. That was eight years ago. A great deal has changed. And for the first time, the one in need of favors is Jay. ??? There’s an episode in the first season of House of Cards when Frank Underwood returns to his alma mater, the Sentinel, for the dedication of a new library on campus bearing his name. Before he’s set to give a speech, Frank asks the event’s planner if he received his guest list, as if there were a few additions that wouldn’t naturally be at this swanky, high-brow affair. It’s clear Frank doesn’t see the people he’s looking for, but has to launch into his speech anyway: I left this campus with fond memories … Right then, three of his old buddies from his college group enter the room, and Underwood instantly transforms back into his former self. “We wouldn’t miss it for the world,” one of Frank’s pals tells him of his big night. What ensues is a night of revelry as the foursome has their way with the campus, drunkenly breaking into buildings while speaking of the days when they were all boys — all equals to the outside world — long before one of them became a congressman. “Do you think this place made us?” Frank asks his closest friend of the bunch. “I don’t know,” he responds. “But I do know I always thought you’d be the guy with your name on something.”  Observing the differences between Nights 1 and 2 of the B-sides shows, Keith Nelson noted at AllHipHop: “Night 1’s reunion resembled The Backstage-era Roc-A-Fella. A wild group unified by unbridled hunger that leads to unrehearsed passionate performances. Night 2’s reunion was more Fade To Black-era Roc-A-Fella. A well-oiled machine so in sync they looked like they grew up together their entire lives.” This is a keen, accurate depiction of what made — and continues to make — Jay important, that group crucial, and their music long-lasting.  No one was just happy to be there. These may have been Jay’s B-sides, but for the rest of the Roc masthead, these were their A-sides. The mere fact that they did complete versions of both songs made this moment feel different from past reunions. Watching each rapper alternate who would be at the front of the stage, with no one spending too much time away from the safety net that was the group, was exciting. Witnessing the group do their choreographed “chicken and gravy” arm move was applause-worthy, as if they’d stuck a triple axel. Hearing a crowd get amped as it recited every word of Bleek’s verse, shouting “Y’ALL DUDES DON’T GET IT” as if it were a battle cry was glorious. It was surreal. We were losing our minds over Bleek and Beans and Freeway verses as much as Jay verses all night. In the past, either Jay would cede the stage to his guys — a magnanimous way of giving them their glimmer of fame — or they’d roam behind him until summoned. Here, they held a strong line. They were equals. He knew, like we all knew, that this was the Jay we wanted. The Jay we trusted. The Jay who convinced us what was cool and what wasn’t. This wasn’t about whether Jay could rap his songs, but rather if Jay could transform back to the guy who made those songs. For years, Jay had been the one who always seemed to get the best end of the deal. His pals, not so much. Be it jail, dwindling success, or public ridicule, they’ve constantly been the ones attempting to stay above water. And historically, the way for each to feel a whiff of the good old times was when Jay would have them along for a ride. For once, on that stage, it was Jay’s turn. It was Jay’s turn to not be the darling of the media. It was Jay’s turn to have public hardship. It was Jay’s turn to potentially fail. And it was Jay’s turn to ask for help. And in this moment — a make-or-break time when he needs people on his side more than ever — it was Jay who needed help from Bleek. And Freeway. And Beans. And Chris. And Neef. And Beyoncé.  ??? The day after Jay’s final B-sides concert, one of the first true positives in the early days of Tidal, Beyoncé and Nicki Minaj released their video for “Feeling Myself,” exclusively on Tidal. Because it’s Beyoncé and Nicki, and the initial rumblings about the video were that it was superb, it was the first real moment when we saw a noticeable shift in the desire to actually subscribe to Tidal. And in that, those who did buy into Tidal had access to something that most people did not. And even when versions of the video began to sneak out — screenshots, GIFs, Vines, low-quality videos — it wasn’t the same experience. And there was no denying that you were bummed you didn’t have the real Bey and Nicki going full Bey and Nicki. Watching it anywhere else was like watching Avatar on network television. For the second time in as many days, Tidal got a win, by way of Jay — by way of those who love Jay. In two days, Tidal went from an easy-to-dismiss prestige project with little proven need to something that could potentially carve out a niche in the zeitgeist. And that has nothing to do with high-fidelity sound. Again, it has less to do with Jay and more with what Jay can make happen, because he’s Jay. And it’s not just Jay, cramming famous people he knows in a room. It’s Jay figuring out the right help to ask at the right time. Tidal isn’t much different from another Jay Z venture, the 40/40 Club, which most nights out of the year is little more than a shinier Applebee’s. But then there are those nights — the nights of legend you only hear about because they weren’t for you — when the place transforms into the “Roc Boys” video. Tidal will probably never be the thing. But when it’s on, it could be on unlike few other properties. But that’s on Jay. He has to keep working, for us. It’s been proven that we don’t truly care if the things Jay does are built, we just want to know that he’s building them. And if he convinces us of that, then there’s a good chance we will come.",2015-05-19T16:22:46+00:00,Music,Browne
67,"R.I.P., Grooveshark: A Tribute to a Great Home for Obscure Music, Illegally Listened To","It was all good just a month ago. #ff @Grooveshark — Rembert Browne (@rembert) March 30, 2015  This day was like many other days. Every few months, the same scenario would present itself. A song would pop into my head — a song that was not on Spotify, not on iTunes, and occasionally not even on YouTube. At these moments in history, the only thing left was to go to Grooveshark.com. And every time — every single time — the streaming service would come through. That tweet was on March 30, 2015. Exactly one month later — yesterday — on Grooveshark.com:  This makes me SICK. Apparently, the “music industry” had “enough” with Grooveshark “stealing music” that allowed people to do as they once claimed, play any song in the world, for free. So Universal Music Group, Sony Music, and Warner Music Group sued Grooveshark, and part of the settlement was that Grooveshark had to shut down its site. Everything. All servers, cleaned. Apps, gone.  ALL OF MY 2011 PLAYLISTS — NO MORE.  I hope you feel really good about yourselves, “music industry.” This one is a true toast to the douchebags, assholes, and scumbags. Also, what ever happened to two weeks’ notice? You didn’t even give the public a chance to go retrieve those cherished Grooveshark memories before you forced Grooveshark’s hand, making it shut down, with the final message being a written apology note. Not to burst your bubble, “music industry,” but regarding the letter: THEY DON’T MEAN IT. (I’ve seen enough hostage movies to know when someone has a figurative gun to their figurative head.) THEY’RE NOT REALLY OUT HERE SUGGESTING I CHECK OUT DEEZER. SORRY, THEY ARE NOT. AND SORRY, THEY SHOULD NOT BE. My apologies for yelling. I’m just furious and I have revenge in my heart. That’s all. Some of my Grooveshark past I’ve forgotten and will never remember, but there was one playlist I’ll never forget. The playlist was only four songs, and it defined why Grooveshark was perfect. Song 1: “One Blood (Remix)” — The Game featuring Jim Jones, Snoop Dogg, Nas, T.I., Fat Joe, Lil Wayne, N.O.R.E., Jadakiss, Styles P, Fabolous, Juelz Santana, Rick Ross, Twista, Kurupt, Daz Dillinger, W.C., E-40, Bun B, Chamillionaire, Slim Thug, Young Dro, Clipse, and Ja Rule  Song 2: “Dey Know (Remix)” — Shawty Lo featuring Ludacris, Young Jeezy, Plies and Lil Wayne  Song 3: “We Fly High (Beefmix)” — Jim Jones, Juelz Santana, and TIDAL’s Jay Z  Song 4: “300 Bars and Runnin” — The Game  At its peak, Grooveshark was a haven for the obscure. An online flea market for B-sides and C-sides, remixes of remixes, audio versions of music videos, things you heard on the radio once and were sure you’d never hear again. And free. So free. The most free.  Grooveshark, you will be missed. You were a true Internet Robin Hood. Of course it had to end, but from the bottom of my heart, thank you for being bad for as long as you could.",2015-05-01T14:35:53+00:00,Music,Browne
68,Three Pivotal Scenes From Jamie Foxx’s Upcoming Street-Dancing Rodent Movie ‘Groove Tails’,"Big news from Hollywood yesterday: The next film featuring Academy Award–winning actor Jamie Foxx has been revealed. That film: Groove Tails.  I learned this via another human saying it aloud in my direction, and then I was asked to guess what it was about. I was fairly certain I knew the entire plot, but never forget homophones is cray. I thought it was Groove Tales, as in a midlife crisis film starring Jamie Foxx as the newly divorced Melvin, who, after years of working his way up through the ranks at Goldman Sachs (and, in turn, not giving enough time to his marriage), starts over and experiences single life — which quickly sees Melvin getting his groove on with a heaping helping of mates, leading him into a downward spiral of sex and drugs and clubs, and then he dies. But it was Groove Tails. So I asked for one more piece of information. What I was told, by Deadline: The story, set in the world of competitive street dancing competitions, but for mice, follows “Biggz”, a mouse deep in debt to a local club, hoping to clean up the streets from a group of menacing alley cats, and get the girl. Now we’re getting somewhere. Immediately, I knew exactly how this movie was going to play out. I think about this precise film plot biweekly. But since I refuse to spoil all of Groove Tails, I will limit my insight to how I’m sure it begins, a key scene in the middle, and a hint at the dynamic ending. ??? Narrator: “Biggz never knew when to call it a night. It was true his whole life, even when he was a little mouse baby. It was part of the charm that Biggz would be known for throughout Cleveland. ‘There goes that boy Biggz. He never knows when to call it a night, which — I must say — is part of the charm that Biggz is known for throughout Cleveland,’ a mouse would say as Biggz walked by. Whether it was one more hand in spades, one more drink at the bar, or one more episode of The West Wing on Netflix, you could count on Biggz to push it further than anyone else. This got Biggz many friends, but occasionally it also resulted in an assortment of enemies. Last night, Biggz knew he should have gone home. But, again, he didn’t. And what happened resulted in enemies who would forever alter the course of his life.” [Cut to the previous night, as we enter the mouse after-hours club at 4:30 a.m.] Biggz is drunk. But not bad drunk — fun drunk. He got a late start to the night and is catching his fifth wind. In classic Biggz fashion, all he wants to do is dance. Also, he got a text that one of his old crushes, Dianaz, is at the after-hours. Biggz and his boy, Tomz, walk into the place, and it’s a good scene. Full, but not too full. Smoky, but not too smoky. Loud, but not too loud. Biggz spots Dianaz and they start talking. And then they start dancing. And then they start making out, just like two drunk-in-love mice often do. They’re in the corner and it’s getting pretty hot and heavy. As they’re up against the wall, however, Biggz bumps into a lit candle. That lit candle falls into a garbage can. The fire grows in the garbage can, and then the garbage can catches on fire, which soon causes an entire wall to become engulfed in flames. Biggz sees what has happened (and what he may have caused) and looks out to see if anyone has noticed. Three gigantic rats in tuxedos are staring right at Biggz and Dianaz. The three giant rats are furious and look as if they’re about to come right at Biggz and Dianaz. But before they can begin their approach, a wooden plank from the ceiling falls between them and immediately catches on fire. It’s clear this place is about to burn down. Biggz and Dianaz make a run for it to avoid burning to death and to escape from the trio of gangster rats. The two disappear into the night and head back to Biggz’s house, where — in a fit of emotion and passion — they make crazy mouse love, hoping to forget about the traumatic experience they’ve just been through. The next morning, Biggz wakes up and Dianaz is gone. His first assumption is that she left for work, but then remembered Dianaz doesn’t work on Tuesdays. A little puzzled, and very hungover, he walks into his kitchen to make some eggs and sees a note on the table.  Biggz is horrified. “I never know when to call it a night, which — I must say — is part of the charm that I’m known for throughout Cleveland,” he says. His questionable ways had finally come back to haunt him, in the form of a $2 million debt to the wrong rat guys, as well as the abduction of his boo-thang Dianaz. And to top it all off, he has only six hours to remember how to battle-dance. He knew how — it was part of his dark past. But he has long put those days behind him.  If he were going to do this, he’d have to confront his demons. Dig into his former self. Call up some old friends. And do whatever it took to get the money, get the girl, and get these menacing rats off the streets of Cleveland, once and for all. ??? It’s an hour until the competition. But his crew is motivated.  And strong.  And talented.  And they’re almost ready. ??? I’ll go only into limited detail so as not to ruin the buildup from the first three hours and 15 minutes of the film, so just know that the ending is darker than anything you could ever imagine. Nothing can prepare you for how Groove Tails ends. I’ll just say this: There will not be a Groove Tails 2. And the club may or may not ever get rebuilt. And Biggz may or may not end up with Dianaz. And Biggz’s crew may or may not win the competition. And, in an insane turn of events, all the cats in Biggz’s crew may or may not kill all of the rodents (Biggz, Dianaz, Tomz, and the three rats). Congrats to Jamie Foxx. Can’t wait to see this film come to life.",2015-10-06T15:46:47+00:00,Movies,Browne
69,"‘Meow the Jewels’: Too Many Humans, Not Enough Cats","Remember 2014? What a year. Seems like ages ago, but it was truly the Wild West, a time when anything was possible, like convincing 2,828 people to fund a version of your album that would be primarily voiced by felines. Such was the case for 41 days across last September and October, when Killer Mike and El-P, now known as Run the Jewels, raised $65,783  to make Meow The Jewels, a cat-remixed version of the great Run the Jewels 2. Because cats are universally thought to be better than dogs, the excitement surrounding this project was immense. The combination of Michael Render and purrs was almost too much to comprehend. But after the successful Kickstarter, it was clear this would eventually become a reality. Fast-forward to this weekend, to “WRTJ,” the Run the Jewels radio show on Apple Music’s Beats 1 station. During their set, they played the first full-length track from the long-promised Meow the Jewels, “Meowrly,” a version of the original RTJ2 song “Early.” I don’t even know who you are, theoretical person who is reading this piece, but I can tell you are disappointed. It’s in the air. I can taste it. And I get it. We all are. The song starts off so promising, with perhaps better Boots production on this than the original — and with the sound of cats and no humans. But then, out of nowhere, there’s the voice of Killer Mike. And it’s like, What the what? Thankfully, it goes back to the kitties. And then it’s like, I get it, they were just getting Killer Mike’s voice out of the way and reminding you that this is a Run the Jewels song. Ultimately that’s not what happened. After the second bout of cat screams, a FULL Killer Mike verse. And then, later, a FULL El-P verse. Meow the Jewels: More like Run the Jewels Occasionally Featuring Cats.  Meow the Jewels: More like Humans Are Incapable of Taking a Backseat to Kitties, and It’s Disgusting Meow the Jewels: More like This Is the Final Straw; Cats Need to Mobilize and Rise Up Against Humans Before It’s Too Late Can humans not check their privilege for one moment? Album after album, song after song, nothing but human voices. Just look at the top 10 songs on the Hot 100.  HUMAN, HUMAN, HUMAN, HUMAN, HUMAN, HUMAN, HUMAN, HUMAN, HUMAN, HUMAN. Diversity in music — yeah, right. There is no diversity in the music industry because everywhere you look, another human being.  This reality is why Meow the Jewels — a truly grassroots movement that could be a long-awaited shake-up to the status quo — was considered so important. Finally, a nonhuman would get its chance to truly speak up. The public would finally get the thing they’ve been begging for, a cat rap album with stellar cat production, with only the sounds of cats. But then the moment comes, it appears, and wouldn’t you know it: humans. All over it. And just like that, again, another chapter in the very long book, Humans Gon’ Human. The human race just can’t let up. They refuse to make way for a nonhuman — it’s always ultimately about them. About us. We’re so self-absorbed, we make the cat album about us. It’s sickening. I talked to a cat about this. Her name was Lunchbox. Lunchbox: “Humans won’t let us have shit.” I wanted to defend my species, but I couldn’t. I wanted to be like, “Ugh, I know, humans be like …” but I could even feel the privilege in saying that. I knew we were always swooping in, trying to take credit for everything. Remember what humans did to #CatTwitter. Yeah, I know you do. One of our darkest hours. It was so disrespectful, I almost left Twitter over it. While the public outrage over this first Meow the Jewels track is deafening, one can only hope this isn’t representative of the entire album. Perhaps “Meowrly” is an outlier and not a sign of things to come. Because it sounds amazing. And the brief parts with the cats are incredible. But there’s simply not enough cat. There’s never been enough cat. Felines deserve to have their voices heard. It’s time. Let’s just hope that Meow the Jewels uses this moment as a source of good, and not just another excuse to profit off the cat, one of the oldest tricks in the book, one of the oldest stories of America.",2015-07-20T16:17:56+00:00,Music,Browne
70,"#Holywatergate: The Theft of a Pope’s Beverage Rocks Washington, D.C.","Sometimes the Internet completely lets you down. And then you have to do things to make the Internet aware of your disappointment with the hope that it never happens again. Last week, His Holiness Francis, Bishop of Rome, Vicar of Jesus Christ, Successor of the Prince of the Apostles, Supreme Pontiff of the Universal Church, Primate of Italy, Archbishop and Metropolitan of the Roman Province, Sovereign of the Vatican City State, Servant of the servants of God made a trip to the United States, beginning in Washington, D.C. When His Holiness Francis, Bishop of Rome, Vicar of Jesus Christ, Successor of the Prince of the Apostles, Supreme Pontiff of the Universal Church, Primate of Italy, Archbishop and Metropolitan of the Roman Province, Sovereign of the Vatican City State, Servant of the servants of God arrived in the nation’s capital (unclear if by BoltBus or Megabus; awaiting confirmation, check back for updates over the course of the year), he first went to the White House to meet with the First Family, followed by a parade, the midday prayer, and Mass at the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception. Things were going great for HHFBORVOJCSOTPOTASPOTUCPOIAAMOTRPSOTVCSSOTSOG, until his next stop: Congress. The “Pope” (as some lazily refer to him) was set to address both houses of Congress. And then he did just that. As he walked out, most of the room’s attention was focused on Pope Francis, since he’s the Bishop of Rome, Vicar of Jesus Christ, Successor of the Prince of the Apostles, Supreme Pontiff of the Universal Church, Primate of Italy, Archbishop and Metropolitan of the Roman Province, Sovereign of the Vatican City State, Servant of the servants of God. All but one person:  He used to be known simply as Representative Bob Brady from Pennsylvania. That was until, like a villain in a Scooby-Doo episode, he used the diversion of “Pope” to steal the drinking glass used by His Holiness Francis, Bishop of Rome, Vicar of Jesus Christ, Successor of the Prince of the Apostles, Supreme Pontiff of the Universal Church, Primate of Italy, Archbishop and Metropolitan of the Roman Province, Sovereign of the Vatican City State, Servant of the servants of God. Bob did that. And then he kept going. Stan White/U.S. Rep. Bob Brady’s Office Yes, he took it back to his Congressional Office Hideout, drank from it, and then passed it around like he got a free bottle of coconut Ciroc at the club.  This is not why we’re here, however. I couldn’t care less about Congressman Bob Brady and what he steals. Or what he said was an approved steal. Or that he claims he’s going pay for it. Or that he admitted to His Holiness Francis, Bishop of Rome, Vicar of Jesus Christ, Successor of the Prince of the Apostles, Supreme Pontiff of the Universal Church, Primate of Italy, Archbishop and Metropolitan of the Roman Province, Sovereign of the Vatican City State, Servant of the servants of God that he did it. My concern is the degree to which this story was covered, ad nauseam, without bringing up the obvious origin story to his nefarious ways. Most stories reporting on his heist eventually were like, This isn’t the first time Brady has robbed someone more important; he also took Obama’s glass at his first inauguration. That’s cool and all, but again, it’s not the story. When one speaks of “Pope” and “theft,” only one thing should pop into your mind:  It’s the 12th episode of the seventh season of The Golden Girls. Titled “The Pope’s Ring,” the episode centers around Sophia stealing Pope John Paul II’s ring during his visit to Miami. As you remember, Sophia and Dorothy have two tickets to the papal Mass, and Dorothy’s super excited, but then Sophia comes in and tells her she traded their two terrible tickets for one really good ticket just for her, so she can be closer to the Pope and ask him to bless her friend Agnes. Blanche, hearing the story, is skeptical that Sophia will be able to get the Pope’s attention, until Sophia says she thinks she’ll get the Pope’s attention pretty easily.  Later in the episode, Sophia returns home from Mass and shows off a new collector’s item: Pope John Paul II’s ring. Dorothy doesn’t believe it’s real, but Sophia assures her it’s legitimate (“You think he’d wear his fakes in public like Zsa Zsa?”). Dorothy needs the full story, so Sophia sets the scene. She’s at Mass, and then sneaks into the handicapped section. When the Pope arrives, he comes to that section and she bends down to kiss his ring. As she’s going to kiss it, security comes and takes the Pope away. And then she tells Dorothy, “He leaves the ring behind, as a memento.”  Dorothy, knowing her mom very well, follows up with the only appropriate response: “Mom, you stole the Pope’s ring?”  Sophia doesn’t want to give it back, suggesting that maybe it’s a sign and further wondering if perhaps her having the ring would get her into the Bible. Dorothy’s not having it, and tells Sophia she has to return it. Before Sophia gives it back, she tries to test out its powers, waving her hand over a glass of water, seeing if it would turn into wine, and then when it doesn’t, saying “Worth a shot.” The next time we see Sophia, it’s when she walks into the kitchen, crashing a typical Golden Girls late-night chat session. Her question to the group: “This may not be a good time, but has anyone seen a large jewel-encrusted ring that’s steeped in history just lying around lately?” Sophia lost the Pope’s ring, which is certainly the only thing worse than stealing the Pope’s ring. Dorothy helps Sophia look for the ring, and then has a weird hunch something is up. Questioning her mother, she suddenly threatens to flip her upside down and shake her and see what falls out of her pockets. At that point, Sophia pulls the ring out of her pocket. Sophia lied about losing the Pope’s ring so she wouldn’t have to return it, which is even worse than losing the Pope’s ring or stealing the Pope’s ring. Ultimately, Sophia’s absolutely blasphemous ways end, as she returns the ring to a priest, and then her friend Agnes actually gets a blessing from Pope John Paul II (played by Eugene Greytak, who also portrayed Pope John Paul II in Night Court, ALF, Sister Act, Murphy Brown, Naked Gun 33 1/3, Ally McBeal, and The Wayans Bros.). He visited the hospital that Agnes was staying in and gave her the blessing that Sophia sorely wanted, the thing behind all of her scheming ways. She’s a lot like Congressman Brady, except she does it for her dear friends and he robs Popes for his mantle of thievery. There is no moral to this story — I’m simply disappointed that our country’s foremost political bloggers don’t watch enough Golden Girls. That’s all.

71,A Note on ‘Jumpman’ by Metro Boomin ft. Drake and Future,"One of the gifts of the latter days of summer was the video to Future’s song “Where Ya At,” from his third studio album, Dirty Sprite 2. The song features a verse from an increasingly swoll and bearded Aubrey Drake Graham, alongside Future Didion, who — with regard to his fashion, most notably his 10-gallon-hat look — is fully dialed in. Because it’s a union of two of the more culturally relevant active rappers — who have two of the most loyal (and occasionally delusional and always hyperbolic) fan bases — they are the immediate stars of the song and video. When you take a step back, however, you realize they are not.  The first minute of the video has Future dancing on a roof, in front of DJ Esco and producer Metro Boomin, who are really dancing on the roof. Each time Esco and Metro appear on the screen, it’s almost subliminal, lasting typically no more than a second. But in that second, you see portions of their hood ballet, and each time it’s equal parts grace and chaos. Seeing them dance in the video changes the way you approach the song, changes how it hits you. And while Future and Drake are certainly gliding to the track, that pales in comparison to the intimate relationship Metro and Esco appear to have — physically — with every granule of it. Which should come as no surprise, as Esco is Future’s DJ (as well as the gatekeeper who decides which music plays at Atlanta’s famed Magic City Mondays, which makes him an ethnomusicologist of sorts) and Metro Boomin produced “Where Ya At.”  This was not the first time that Drake and Future had worked together, and as we learned weeks later, not the last, as a joint mixtape, What a Time to Be Alive, was released on Sunday night. Recorded recently over a six-day stretch in Atlanta, the project comprises 11 songs, nine of which contain both Drake and Future, with two solo tracks (one for each rapper) tacked on at the end. Again, because it’s Drake and Future, the immediate reaction is to focus on every word uttered by the two rappers and break down the hidden meanings that give insight into various disses and beefs, which ultimately will lead to future blog posts. To their credit, they do a great deal to grab your attention: 10 songs from either of these rappers would be a big deal, especially with little time for fans to emotionally prepare — that it’s a joint project only intensifies the effect. That said, while this is certainly a Drake-and-Future collaboration, it’s a Metro Boomin mixtape. The two rappers are clearly the luxury car, but Metro as executive producer is the steering wheel. He worked on seven of the tracks, producing three of them by himself. One of the songs that he solo-produced is “Jumpman.” For years, the many dances that have come out of Atlanta have been lyric-dependent. When it’s time to “stanky leg,” you listen to GS Boyz’s “Stanky Legg.” The only time you really “walk it out” is during DJ UNK’s “Walk It Out.” And when an entire room is ready to “swag surf,” that is happening only when “Swag Surfin” by Fast Life Yungstaz (or Lil Wayne) is blaring from the speakers. The current trend is slightly different but still based on the same formula. The past few years — in large part due to the rise of Vine, Instagram video, and dancing Atlanta teens being the most creative humans who exist — have produced a universe of dances, most of which eventually inspire songs. The dances begin in driveways, school parking lots, cafeterias, and living rooms, and they’re recorded and shared so much that a flurry of songs are built around them. There isn’t a singular song for the nae-nae, for example, but there are many songs that are constructed (and named) in a way that allow those who want to nae-nae to do so to a variety of beats with simplistic, repetitive, “nae-nae”-heavy lyrics. The yeet began, culturally, with a Vine of a kid affectionately nicknamed Lil Meatball doing the dance on his school’s track. Because the Vine caught on and the singular move is great, many yeet-titled songs popped up, just so people could capitalize on the newest dance. Most notably, babyfaced rapper Silento has turned this entire craze into one song, “Watch Me (Whip/Nae Nae),” which does little more than list all of them. (It shot up to no. 3 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.) What Metro has done on this mixtape, most notably on “Jumpman,” is to fall somewhere in the middle. The song is begging for you to do a number of already established dances (as well as ones that haven’t been invented yet, plus things that aren’t technically dances but just feel good in the moment), but nowhere does it tell you what to do. The instinct to do certain moves is in the DNA of the song. Listening to “Jumpman” for the second time, I was already dabbing in my chair, unaware for a few moments that I was dabbing in my chair. The song was built for it. And we know the song was built for it because we’ve seen Metro glide to his own creations. The production swells and relaxes throughout, with the smoother periods hinting that you were only bars away from hitting the move of your choice. And Drake and Future do exactly what Metro’s production asks for, taking full advantage of their ability to use ad-libs, hit high notes, or repeat the same word at the end of bars, using them right when the beat asks for the listener to hit a dance move — that classic Atlanta one-note dance move. There are two parts to Atlanta dance music right now, the on- and off-beat moves. It’s a game of constants and variables. The constant is the move you always come back to, the move that happens every four beats, the thing that gets the name, the glory — the nae-nae, the dab, the yeet, the whip. The variable is what’s happening on those other three beats, the freestyle, the do whatever you want as long as you make it back to some socially agreed-upon move by beat four.  “Jumpman” comes at a time when there’s a surplus of fun shit to do when a good rap song comes on at a party. In a little over three minutes, one could pull out nine or 10 moves, plus all the freestyle that comes between all of those moves. It brings you back to Esco and Metro on the roof, where each time you catch a glimpse of them, they’re doing something slightly different. Essentially, it’s a master class of production and rapping and context firing on all cylinders, all very much firmly within the pantheon of Atlanta hip-hop, most of which was meant to be played loudly, played in public, and, above all else, danced to.",2015-09-22T09:43:38+00:00,Music,Browne
72,The ‘Pretty Little Liars’ Reveal We’ve Been Waiting 27 Years For,"For six insane years, the ABC Family phenomenon Pretty Little Liars has captivated, frustrated, and tortured the teen-murder-drama-loving public with near-reckless abandon. With almost-death typically lurking around every corner for any character with a pulse, the main constant has long been a mysterious character known only as “A.” This “A” is the person/group/organization/government/Banksy that, for years, has tried to kill the Liars (and anyone they love, or have known, or have texted, or have sexted). But season in and season out, the same question remained: WHO IS A? Last night, August 11 — the mid–Season 6 finale — that question was finally answered. But before tuning in and learning who “A” was, it was time to throw out some final guesses. Was it big, fat, dumb Ezra? Faux-Riggins? Aria? Zayn? Matthew Gray Gubler? Toby? Garrett? Grandma? Lord Byron? Felix Da Housecat? The Hague? Alex Mack? Mona? JASON?  It was very unclear. For the longest time, I couldn’t decide if it was Emily. Or Alison. Or Allison. Or Alyson. Or Alyssa. Or Albertsons. Or Jerome. Or Rob Lowe’s Brother. Or Rob Lowe. Or Coral. Or the Miz. Or Harold. Or Meredith. Or Coffee Shop Guy. Or Mocha Joe. Or Maya. Or Noel Kahn. Or Adam Lambert. Or Nate. Or the Brit. Or Zack. OR EXECUTIVE PRODUCER OLIVER GOLDSTICK.  Everyone, at some point, has gone above and beyond the call of duty to convince those with eyes and ears that they were the dreaded “A.” Especially Spencer. And Garrett (again). And Pastor Ted. And Mom. And Paige. And Stabler. And Benson. And the Expos. And Clifford. AND OLYMPIC SWIMMER MISSY FRANKLIN.  These were all legitimate guesses. But somehow, they were all wrong. After taking a two-year blood pressure break from watching Pretty Little Liars, last night I hopped back on the train, for one night only. Confusing doesn’t even begin to explain what the experience was like, especially upon finally learning the long-awaited identity of A: CECE DRAKE A.K.A. CHARLOTTE DILAURENTIS A.K.A. CHARLES DILAURENTIS A.K.A. OLDER SISTER FIGURE TO NOT ACTUALLY DEAD ALI A.K.A. WHA?  Of course this is how it played out. Of course the one thing I overlook is that “A” would probably be a child who was sent to a mental institution, escaped after faking death, transitioned, and became the “play” older sister to a once-thought-to-be-dead girl, but in actuality was a biological sibling the entire time and ultimately the realest killer and texted in these murderous, always-high-fashion streets. OF COURSE. What a show. What a journey. What a lack of you-know-whats given. These are the moments when Pretty Little Liars makes a Shonda Rhimes show look like a Bob Ross painting. With that said, this is also why I had to excommunicate myself from the Church of PLL. It’s just too much, even for me, lover of too much. But I salute the show for continuing to troll the public, especially when it’s worth assuming we’re mere months from learning that “A” isn’t even the main person to worry about. Just wait until people start getting text messages again. From “B.”",2015-08-12T16:31:29+00:00,TV,Browne
73,"‘Minions’ Review: An Instant Classic, Definitely","“Right on,” said Herb Overkill, husband of Scarlet Overkill — the most legendary supervillain of the late ’60s to the three main Minions. “You guys are crazy, little, and way yellow, and I dig that.” Herb nailed it. But in a more real way than I expected. As in, Herb really liked the Minions and wasn’t just saying that to be cute — as in, I thought I was going to have to pretend to dig the Minions for the sake of being contrarian (which required being all in on Minions), but then actually watched the film and now have fallen for all things Minions. Protect Minions at all costs. I couldn’t believe it. I can’t believe it. I didn’t even have to pretend. I just loved them. And loved this film.  Minions is excellent. That’s basically the review. Go see it. Feel free to stop reading, because that’s the takeaway. Good day. ??? If your skepticism still exists, I fully understand. I know why sitting through something like Minions seems so terrible to endure. And to be frank, there are moments early in the film when it does itself no favors. But as they say — if you give the Minions an inch of love, they’ll give you a mile. Here’s a perfect example: The first 30 seconds of the film are enough to make someone with the agency over their own decisions leave the theater. It’s the three main Minions singing the Universal Studios theme song in that high-pitched terrible Minion voice. It’s painful. It’s terrible. I still can’t get it out of my head. And even as I sit here, ready to try to convince adults that this film is worthwhile, I’ll never forgive the creators of this film for that beginning. Seriously, if you go see this film, find a way to skip the first two minutes. Trust me, you’ll figure out the plot. This is Part 2 of my Minions discovery. In Part 1, I outlined the extent to which I had zero insight into the Despicable Me franchise, for which Minions is apparently a prequel of sorts. This is helpful, because Minions requires no prior knowledge. And not simply “no prior knowledge of other related films,” but “no prior knowledge, period.” You can go in dark to Minions — not having a single piece of knowledge in your brain — and still get it. Brains are not for Minions. All you need is a heart.  In the beginning of Minions, the purpose of these creatures is made clear. There are a lot of Minions, most of whom look quite similar. Minions are a social construct, so I think it’s safe to say they’re a race. Minions have been in these Earth streets for eons, predating humans. And all that the Minions want is to be enslaved by cruel masters. Seriously. That’s the ideal life of a Minion. Not freedom — indentured servitude. But the Minions are morons. Actually, they’re geniuses who refuse to capitalize on their accidental genius, which in turn makes them morons. All they want is a tyrannical master to rule them, but whenever they find one, they accidentally kill it.  This is the moment every sane being would celebrate. It’s instant freedom. You won, Minion, GO BE FREE. But no, not the Minions. When they accidentally kill their rude master (examples: a T. rex, early man, an Egyptian ruler, Dracula, Napoleon), they get sad and attempt to find the next ruler who can make their lives a living hell. The Minions had Stockholm syndrome before Stockholm existed. The movie’s three main Minions are Bob, Stuart, and Kevin. These Minions With Attitude are looking for another ruler to make their lives hell for another 600 million years, so, led by Kevin, they vow to go out into the world and not return until they have found the most diabolical “massa” around. So they leave. And wouldn’t you know it, they end up in New York City in 1968. As to not gloss over anything, yes, their names are Bob, Stuart, and Kevin. Universal All Minions have basic names (we briefly learn of a Mike, an Earl, and a Carl). That’s a cool, endearing thing about the Minions. A not-so-cool thing is how they’re often generalized: as gibberish speakers.  No. Not even close. This isn’t gibberish. Minions is a foreign-language film. Most of the time that Minions are speaking, they’re just screaming. When they’re not screaming, they’re saying words. Do I understand all of these words? Absolutely not, but the same is true when I go to Tokyo. Or Moscow. Or Jacksonville. It’s just a different culture, with a different dialect. Don’t throw your hatred at the Minions because they’re different. Having said that, from a comedic standpoint, this gibberish shit is hilarious. It actually grows on you over time, because you catch some real English words every now and then. They sneak them in. The one thing you can count on is the Minions saying each other’s names quite clearly. Also, every so often, like a care package of sorts, you get a “que paso.” It works, this gag. It’s a good bit they do just enough to not be annoying, and it stays funny throughout the film. Having said that, comedy aside, this movie is super real. As soon as the Minions get into New York City, Bob has trouble catching a cab. In New York. He is ultimately mistaken for luggage and thrown into the trunk; when discovered, he is thrown into the street. Oh, just what it’s like to be different — in America.  “Everybody wanna be a minion, but nobody wanna be a minion.” –Anonymous After bouncing around NYC, they find themselves in a mall and get locked inside once it closes. In that mall, they find a television, and on that television, commercials. One of those commercials is a spot for VillainCon. The three Minions are ecstatic. They found their Stockholm. Unfortunately, it’s in Orlando. But nothing stands in the way of a Minion and his Stockholm. So they go outside.  They’re thankfully picked up by a sweet family that happens to be going to Orlando. Who just happens to be going to Orlando? Could they possibly be going to VillainCon? Wait, there’s no way they could be villains, could they? It doesn’t seem like it. They’re just so sweet and wonderful. Universal There’s no way in hell they’re going to that den of sin. They’re probably taking a nice family trip to Epcot. I mean, there’s a baby in the car aft— Universal THE BABY HANDED HIS DAD A GUN AND THEY WENT TO GO ROB A BANK WHILE THE MINIONS WERE IN THE CAR. This was the moment it was clear Minions wasn’t messing around. They were out here — yes, coming for every single one of your dollars — but also succeeding in trying to be an actual humorous comedy. THERE WAS A STICKUP IN MINIONS, LIKE I’M NOT HERE FOR THAT. LIKE YOU’RE NOT HERE FOR THAT.  In their getaway, the cops chase them and, in perfect Minion fashion, the Minions accidentally shoot a rocket launcher that stops the cops and gives them further freedom. The family becomes forever indebted to the Minions, taking them all the way to Orlando. Upon reaching Orlando, they finally find who they’re looking for: Scarlet Overkill, the star of VillainCon. Universal In an arena, she flies out and everyone loses their minds, Minions included. She’s Taylor Swift and Michelle Obama and Cruella De Vil and Serena Williams all in one. Once she quiets the crowd, her first line is this: “When I started out, people said a woman could never rob a bank as well as a man. Well, times have changed.” The crowd explodes. Men dressed up like their hero are near death from her presence. It’s like watching Betty Friedan and Gloria Steinem play spades against Audre Lorde and bell hooks. When it comes to villainy, Scarlet is just clearly the best. Continuing her speech: “Have any of you ever dreamt of working for the greatest supervillain of all time?” The crowd explodes again, begging to work with her. So she offers a deal: Whoever can take the ruby out of her hand wins. And in that moment, for almost two minutes, male villains of all shapes and sizes bum-rush the stage, attempting to fight her for the ruby. And for almost two minutes, she beats up about 25 men. And none can take the ruby from her. Somehow, in the melee, the ruby ends up in Bob’s mouth. And just like that, the commotion stops and Scarlet Overkill crowns them the winners, and the Minions become her understudies. They’ve found their Stockholm. Scarlet invites them onto her plane and brings them back to her evil crib in England. There, they meet her rail-thin, heady husband Herb. At their home — when they’re not public villains — they seem like a cute couple. Peaceful, even. They’ve welcomed the Minions like family, caring for them like any good hosts would treat exchange students abroad in a new land for a semester. But then, suddenly, she gives them a mission. Not a big one; just them stealing the crown from the queen of England. Oh, and if they fail, she’ll kill them. This is the evil tyrant they’ve always been looking for. They’re scared, but they have to do it. Also, they have to let the rest of the Minion race know they’ve found their new tyrant. And when they do (via phone call), the rest of the Minion race begins their arduous journey to England. At this point, I’m all in on the preservation of the Minion race. I’m unable to fully explain why, but I’m emotional about these yellow, goggled non-people. They’re actually quite charming. The Minions rollout really did the actual Minions a disservice. What you think going into the film — because of the Minions PR onslaught — is that you’re going to be stuck with 100 million Minions in your face at all times. But the reality is, 90 percent of the time, it’s just three. And three Minions constitute a gaggle of Minions, and a gaggle of Minions is adorbs. As in, I think I love them. As in, don’t judge a Minion by its overbearing press campaign. You remember that decent album that happened once, Jay Z’s Magna Carta Holy Grail — an album that was widely panned, because Samsung slightly made us hate it before it ever came out? Yeah, that’s Minions. MCHG isn’t actually that bad, but we were all so fed up by being sold tablets by way of rap, that before we ever heard it, we knew we didn’t want to like it. If the Minions rollout had any chill, there would be no backlash. On the other hand, had there been more Minions chill, the movie may have not made $400 million worldwide over the weekend. What really matters, though, is you think you don’t like the Minions. But if you ever choose to be brave enough to meet the Minions, you’ll probably discover your worst nightmare — you like the Minions. But enough with Jay Z. The Minions find Queen Elizabeth. Getting her crown is not easy, however. Queen Elizabeth is from Bronxville. No joke. In her repertoire of moves: the People’s Elbow.  Yeah, like that’s not funny. And all while the Kinks play in the background. MINIONS IS SO GOOD I GOTTA JUMP BACK, WANNA KISS M’SELF. Five minutes after this, Bob becomes king of England. Universal Bob became king because in the Minions’ dramatic escape from the England police force, he pulled the sword out the stone (yes, that one), which automatically makes someone king, because of course. Following this, he has to make a speech as the new king. And in this moment, watching Bob make his gibberish speech at Buckingham Palace, I finally realized why this film was rapidly reaching “instant classic” territory. It’s animated Pootie Tang.  When my damie Bob goes to make his speech, he has the classic gibberish speech movie moment. The entire populace has found nothing odd with a yellow pill becoming king of England. And when he screams “KING BOB,” everyone loses it. But then he gets comfortable, lets his guard down a bit, and really starts speaking non-words. And suddenly, he is met with a sea of blank stares, almost as if he’s moments away from the jig fully being up. So, in a panic, he goes back to what he knows, screaming “KING BOB.” And just like that, everyone is back on his side, again not finding anything odd with the fact that the new king is a yellow bullet wearing goggles and overalls. King Bob is Pootie.  Capachow on the tippi tais, you know? While there have been a flurry of spoilers in this review, there is no way I could go into detail about the ending. The last 20 minutes are just movie magic. Just know that Bob isn’t the king for long, the Minions get enslaved (again), all of their small yellow cousins finally find England and go full-scale Million Minion March on Londontown, one minion becomes Godzilla-size, and there’s a Randy Quaid–in–Independence Day moment that will probably make you cry. And the best part is, when it finishes, you’re like, That was a perfect film, please don’t ruin it with a sequel. And then you remember that the sequel (Despicable Me) has already happened. And that you’re never going to watch it — so Minions can always just be Minions.  Again, long live Xenu.",2015-07-14T08:47:14+00:00,Movies,Browne
74,Rembert Explains: What REALLY Happened Behind the Scenes of ‘Designing Women’,"Before TMZ, and even before the Internet, there was celebrity drama. But where was it? And who was involved? And how did people find out? Rembert Browne investigates.  Dixie didn’t show up. You see, on the first go-around in 1989, Dixie was very much present. So present, in fact, she was Delta’s matron of honor. But when it was time for Delta to renew her vows two years later, there was no Dixie. No Jean. No Annie. And not even Meshach. So what in Sugarbaker Design’s name did Delta do? That’s a long story. But what was set in stone — following this re-declaration of love in the summer of 1991 — was that the upcoming sixth season of Designing Women would go forward without Delta Burke.  ??? For five strong years, 1986 to 1991, Designing Women was the most important show in America starring four women who didn’t live in Miami. Considered by some as little more than a Golden Girls knockoff — that show debuted a year earlier, in 1985, to rave reviews, because it’s the most zinger-filled show we’ve ever had — the show struggled at first to find its footing. It bounced around from time slot to time slot, and CBS even threatened to cancel it, but a viewer campaign proved too strong, convincing CBS that the show did have a true audience. And by 1989, coupled back-to-back with Murphy Brown on Monday nights, it became a hit. The show, as you may remember, revolved around two sisters — Julia and Suzanne Sugarbaker — played by Dixie Carter and Delta Burke. Joining the two at their Atlanta interior design firm were Mary Jo Shively (Annie Potts), Charlene Frazier (Jean Smart), and Anthony Bouvier (Meshach Taylor). The infectious onscreen chemistry between the costars suggested that they were friends offscreen. And the hunch was right, because they were. But could it last? That was expertly instigated, as the foursome were guests on The Joan Rivers Show.  Joan: Now, you’re all still very good friends. All Four: Yes. Joan: At this point … so far … well, you know it’s going to start. A few things are clear after watching the cast as a real-life unit. Each woman is independently funny; as a group, the one-upsmanship that we see in the show carried into their real lives. When all cylinders were clicking, as they were in this appearance (and typically on the show, through their characters), it’s hard to top. But it’s also easy to see, with these types of strong personalities occupying one space (especially Dixie and Delta), how it could be an easy breeding ground for drama. Not that it would, but simply that it could.  And it did. ??? “Along with her talent, Delta, 34, carries into life a reputation for fiery southern passion that is as tangible as bayou moss.” —People, 1991  The 1991 People cover story on Delta and Designing Women was, in some ways, the final real-time chapter of the book, emerging the same week that the show began taping its sixth season, its first without Burke. But the early stages of the drama stem from one of the happiest days of Delta’s life, her 1989 marriage to actor Gerald McRaney. According to Burke — speaking to Barbara Walters in 1991 — her husband was the first man who let her, a former Miss Florida beauty queen, feel comfortable in her own skin, the first man who saw beyond her beauty. Around this time, Delta’s weight began to increase, in a way that was noticeable to everyone: the public, the network, the producers, the show’s costars, Delta, and Gerald. According to People, “her [Delta’s] husband stocked a room at home with pounds of chocolate, as a dramatic way of saying he loved her for herself, not for the way she looked.” Unfortunately for Delta, and the show, this weight gain unfairly became the focus for the public, creating a tabloid whirlwind surrounding this idea of Burke “letting herself go.” While some saw Delta’s husband as an enabler of this distraction, the weight gain wasn’t met with an ill response within the show, and thus was not the true reason for the mistrust surrounding McRaney. In fact, the weight gain — while noticeable — was not standing between Delta and her role. In December 1989, the show decided to acknowledge what much of the public had taken to be their business — Delta’s weight — by way of a very special episode, “They Shoot Fat Women, Don’t They?” in which Suzanne returns to her 15-year high school reunion and is ostracized for the weight she has gained. The episode became a landmark in Designing Women history, helping to earn Delta an Emmy nomination — tackling her tabloid drama was seen as a courageous act.  So there was support from her TV family concerning the negative publicity she’d received for her weight gain. But there was something else less-than-peripherally related to Delta’s husband, and again considered to be part of an ever-evolving attempt to prove his love to her. It was McRaney filling his wife’s head with a confidence that would later be seen as arrogance. The end result: Delta Burke convinced that she was the outright star of Designing Women. The issue was, no one else saw it that way.   ??? The most powerful couple in the Designing Women universe was not Burke and her husband Gerald McRaney. That designation would go to the Thomasons, Harry and Linda. The two were co-executive producers of the show; Linda was also the show’s creator. Burke, while a burgeoning star, was but a piece of the puzzle to their Designing Women universe. In the spring of 1990, however, Harry Thomason was approached by Burke’s agent to discuss the reality — or necessity — of that equality. In a classic “he said, he said,” the agent claimed the meeting was to patch up a tense relationship between Burke and the Thomasons; Harry claimed it was about “the emergence of Delta as the star of the show.” Some of this seemed to revolve around the critical acclaim “They Shoot Fat Women, Don’t They?” brought to the series — Burke claimed the episode was her idea, while Linda Bloodworth-Thomason said she had to spend hours convincing Burke that it was a good idea. This was the point at which the private bickering became a public feud. Burke, to her hometown paper, The Orlando Sentinel, on August 2, 1990, the day her Emmy nomination was announced: There are a lot of things wonderful about it, but I have not wanted to be there for some time now. It is not a good workplace, not a good environment … It’s so strange, being part of something that’s so wonderful and so awful at the same time. The Thomasons, responding in a press release: We are all mentally exhausted from the daily trials and tribulations of Delta Burke. As 1990 progressed, Delta said more about the Thomasons in the press, claiming they forced the cast to go on “extreme diets,” and that Harry Thomason had, at one point, locked the cast in a room and screamed at them. The public beef reached its most visible point in November 1990, as Burke joined Barbara Walters for a tell-all conversation — and did so without telling the Thomasons. In this talk with Walters, while focusing much of her critique on the Thomasons, Burke revealed one thing about her costar, Dixie Carter: She was disappointed that Carter, someone she considered a close longtime friend, had publicly sided with the Thomasons. But it wasn’t just Carter siding with the Thomasons, it was the entire cast, ultimately leaving Burke out on her own.  While all of this drama was swirling, Designing Women was at its ratings peak in its fifth season. The week before the Barbara Walters special, Designing Women was the fifth-highest-rated television show. At this same time, however, Burke had asked for a release from her contract, something that was initially perceived to be a negotiation tactic to garner a higher salary. But then she asked to be written out of the show in a series of transitory episodes. The Thomasons, despite the public chaos they were embroiled in, still wanted her character onboard, so they refused. And two months later, in January 1991, Burke sued the Thomasons on the grounds of being written out of an episode as punishment. The public quarrels were reaching a fever pitch — with still months left in the fifth season — but it’s what happened privately a few months later that ultimately signified the beginning of the end. Burke came to the set on March 28 to film her segments, then left. Once she was gone, a meeting with the cast and producers took place, with the purpose of voting on whether Burke should return for the sixth season. The vote was that she shouldn’t. The following week, Harry Thomason wrote a letter to the chairman of Columbia Pictures, asking him to release Burke from her contract. On May 13, 1991, the finale of Season 5 of Designing Women aired, and it was the final time Delta Burke appeared as Suzanne Sugarbaker on Designing Women.  ??? “I’ll be friends with these women for the rest of my life” —Delta Burke, 1986 In 1991, this sure didn’t seem like it would ring true. Designing Women went on for two more seasons, with Burke (and soon Jean Smart) replaced by Julia Duffy and Jan Hooks. But the show was never the same. While pulling in great post-fallout ratings in Season 6, the show tanked in Season 7 and was soon off the air. In the years that passed, some of those lingering beefs from the show’s glory years remained. But time heals. People grow up. There’s beef, and then there’s squashed beef. And eventually, some of the more tense relationships were ultimately patched up. After years of bickering, Burke and Linda Bloodworth-Thomason reunited for the second life of Suzanne Sugarbaker in the 1995 sitcom Women of the House. While the show only lasted a season, its ultimate legacy is the professional and personal mending of fences between the actress and the writer. As for Burke and her costar, onscreen rival, friend turned foe WOE Dixie Carter, their fallout lasted far longer. After not attending the renewal of Burke’s vows in 1991, more than a decade passed before the two began to reconcile. But it happened — privately, and eventually publicly. In 2002, Delta Burke appeared as a guest star on Family Law, a show in which Dixie Carter was a costar.  While their first foray into drama as a unit, it marked the third time Carter and Burke appeared on a show together and the third time they played relatives.1 As the years went on and nostalgia became an increasingly valuable form of currency, the gang found ways to reassemble. Perhaps the most notable was in 2006, when the Museum of Television & Radio (now known as the Paley Center for Media) honored Linda Bloodworth-Thomason and, in doing so, presented a panel with Thomason and her four Designing Women.   There’s nothing like pushing through drama. As the years progress, and the sad reality of death hits the cast of Designing Women (Dixie Carter in 2010, Meshach Taylor and Jan Hooks in 2014), it’s a relief to know that things were patched up voluntarily, instead of at the moment when it’s too late. Long live Designing Women, long live the non-Floridian South, and most importantly, long live beefing and then, years later, learning to laugh about it.",2015-05-26T15:46:50+00:00,TV,Browne
75,"Thoughts on the ‘Wild Wild West’ Video Movie Awards Performance, for Absolutely No Reason","Typically, on the Internet, nostalgia is thrown on things from our past when an appropriate, relevant date presents itself. A peg, if you will. But sometimes, it just feels right to discuss something from days gone by, just because. For that reason, Grantland contributor Vann Newkirk and staff mascot Rembert Browne have decided to break down Will Smith’s “Wild Wild West” 1999 MTV Video Movie Awards performance.   Browne: This man Willard Smith is riding a horse. Two seconds in and I’m already shaking, Vann.  Newkirk: You just reminded me that Will Smith and Mitt Romney have the same name. Congrats. Browne: Willmitt just got off his horse and immediately raised one arm, as if to signify victory, before the actual performance even started. What a king.  I have to assume this was a celebratory “Y’ALL LOOKIT, I JUST RODE A REAL HORSE.” Newkirk: Or, “I JUST RODE A REAL HORSE AND I DIDN’T DIE OR KICK A WOMAN IN THE HEAD” Browne: Will is onstage doing lyrical turntable scratches, and I am so here for it. You have to be so next-level cool to do certain things with such reckless corn-filled abandon. Newkirk: It just occurred to me that these are the ‘99 Video Movie Awards. Fourteen years later, on this same storied network, this happened.  Life. Browne: 1999. What a charmed time to be alive. Remember the Video MUSIC Awards that year? On 9/9/99. If you had cable and were anywhere between 10 and 14, that year’s two VMAs were the two greatest days of your life to that point. Also, it was bittersweet, because there was a chance these were the final two VMAs, before we all died via Y2K Willennium. Newkirk: You sure we didn’t, and this isn’t all a post-Willennium J.J. Abrams–style dream? The idea of a dancing rapper is wild nowadays. Imagine Future breaking out an MJ “Smooth Criminal”-inspired dance sequence in a purple hat with a fake gun. Imagine that shit. Imagine Meek Mill riding a horse into the VMAs. Imagine Drake … doing anything that involves moving limbs and rapping at the same time. Will Smith is the GOAT. Browne: Hot take: If you really didn’t like rap, “Wild Wild West” was your jam. A second flame emoji opinion: The reason this song is so terrible is because it couldn’t start any worse: “Wiki wiki Wild Wild West, Jim West, desperado, ruff ryder, no you don’t want nada.” Are you kidding me, Will? One would hope that, in making a rap song, you would want to string words together that others would also enjoy saying. But this opening — it’s painful. One time I think I faked a four-second phone call just to get out of the first line. Newkirk: Think I missed the memo about this song being awful, because it’s awesome, Rembert. Will Smith + Sisqó is like the Hall & Oates of the ’90s. True Detective, Season 3. The Fresh Dragon. Browne: We should probably actually talk about the performance. Something that I appreciate about it: They turned a big-budget event like the VMAs into something resembling a junior high musical.  “Wild Wild West” at the VMAs walked so that Hamilton at the Public Theater could run. Newkirk: True. Also, DID YOU JUST NOTICE THAT WILLENNIUM REGISTERS AS A REAL WORD IN GOOGLE DOCS? Browne: We’re so blessed. Speaking of God, this Will Smith call-and-response “now who you gonna call” section is very Kirk Franklin of him. Newkirk: I wish he would have brought out Kirk Franklin. Browne: Having not seen this in a decade, I swore that was Hannibal Buress in all black leather. But it was Kool Moe Dee.  Hey Hannibal, it’s Rem. You should really consider going as Kool Moe Dee from the “Wild Wild West” VMAs performance for Halloween. Everyone who reads this post and Kool Moe Dee will instantly get the costume. Newkirk: Oh look, it’s the two junior partners of Dru Hill, casually strolling down a staircase in leather suits. Where the hell is Sisqó? His part’s coming up? Browne: How DARE you call Jazz and Nokio “junior partners.” Jazz and Nokio ran so that Sisqó could fly. Newkirk: Nokio has a brown leather bucket hat on, man. That’s iconic, but still — THERE’S SISQÓ.  Browne: You’re right. They are junior partners. Good lord, Sisqó was the king. Newkirk: That intro, just wow. There’s fireworks. Sisqó in a suede suit and vest. Sisqó dropping perfect notes even though he’s being bathed in fire in a suede vest. Then there’s Sisqó jumping 15 feet in the air and landing it, easy. Browne: Watching Will Smith, Kool Moe Dee, and three-fourths of Dru Hill do Destiny’s Child–like choreography together is something special. We didn’t realize how good we had it in 1999. It’s easy to forget how famous Will Smith was between 1999 and 2000. DO YOU KNOW HOW FAMOUS YOU HAVE TO BE TO GET AWAY WITH THIS? Newkirk: You think Sisqó could have a late-career renaissance as a white party Tom Joyner linen suit staple who casually does hooks for Kanye and awesome stuff with Snoop Dogg? Browne: I’m glad you brought up Tom Joyner, because I was just thinking about Essence Fest. And with Essence Fest comes Archbishop Charlie Wilson. I never realized it until now, but Sisqó has some Charlie Wilson in him. That whine that should be annoying, but is still great. That whine that doesn’t really contain any literacy, but you still manage to assign English words to it — it’s right there. And it’s great. And I miss it. SQUABADOOBEEEE. Newkirk: SQUABADOOBEEE.  Browne: They look like the interiors of five different minivans. Newkirk: I’d totally drive a Sisqó minivan. Jazz looks like your grandma’s couch. Browne: How ’bout you keep my grandma’s couch out your mouth. Newkirk: Watch this part a few times. Here’s Willard, attempting an MJ-style hat flip, getting it kinda right but with none of the actual style that makes the move cool.  You can tell he really has no idea what he’s doing and just practiced really hard for this one moment. He looks like a robot. He’s focused on the hat like it’s a calculus test. He’s Blake Griffin shooting jumpers. Browne: I can’t believe we’ve made it this far without discussing the hue of his suit. The full commit, hat and all, to burgundy. He looks like he’s headed to either the Player Haters’ Ball or a funeral for a friend he met at the Player Haters’ Ball. Newkirk: I know, but do you see him out-dancing Sisqó during the breakdown? Meanwhile, Hannibal Buress has been in the corner dropping ad-libs for three whole minutes. In a leather suit that has to weigh 50 pounds. This is Spliff Star–level hypeman stamina. Browne: SHUT UP I FORGOT.  THEY ROLLED MY MAN OUT, PERHAPS THE GREATEST LIVING MUSICIAN, FOR THE FINAL SCENE OF THIS COMEDY OF ERRORS LIKE HE WAS ERIC BENET OR SOMETHING. I WILL NEVER FEEL OK ABOUT THIS. HE DESERVED BETTER OR AT LEAST HIS OWN LEATHER GETUP. Newkirk: Yes. Stevie Wonder on a saloon piano harmonizing with Sisqó. Will Smith, Stevie, Kool Moe Dee, Dru Hill, and Jazzy Jeff on the same stage to the tune of a $4 million Western reenactment. This is the greatest thing ever. Browne: I was hating, but you’re right. This is actually the greatest song, performance, and moment in American history. SGranitz/WireImage Newkirk: We are Willennials.",2015-05-21T18:28:49+00:00,Music,Browne
76,"R.I.P., Grooveshark: A Tribute to a Great Home for Obscure Music, Illegally Listened To","It was all good just a month ago. #ff @Grooveshark — Rembert Browne (@rembert) March 30, 2015  This day was like many other days. Every few months, the same scenario would present itself. A song would pop into my head — a song that was not on Spotify, not on iTunes, and occasionally not even on YouTube. At these moments in history, the only thing left was to go to Grooveshark.com. And every time — every single time — the streaming service would come through. That tweet was on March 30, 2015. Exactly one month later — yesterday — on Grooveshark.com:  This makes me SICK. Apparently, the “music industry” had “enough” with Grooveshark “stealing music” that allowed people to do as they once claimed, play any song in the world, for free. So Universal Music Group, Sony Music, and Warner Music Group sued Grooveshark, and part of the settlement was that Grooveshark had to shut down its site. Everything. All servers, cleaned. Apps, gone.  ALL OF MY 2011 PLAYLISTS — NO MORE.  I hope you feel really good about yourselves, “music industry.” This one is a true toast to the douchebags, assholes, and scumbags. Also, what ever happened to two weeks’ notice? You didn’t even give the public a chance to go retrieve those cherished Grooveshark memories before you forced Grooveshark’s hand, making it shut down, with the final message being a written apology note. Not to burst your bubble, “music industry,” but regarding the letter: THEY DON’T MEAN IT. (I’ve seen enough hostage movies to know when someone has a figurative gun to their figurative head.) THEY’RE NOT REALLY OUT HERE SUGGESTING I CHECK OUT DEEZER. SORRY, THEY ARE NOT. AND SORRY, THEY SHOULD NOT BE. My apologies for yelling. I’m just furious and I have revenge in my heart. That’s all. Some of my Grooveshark past I’ve forgotten and will never remember, but there was one playlist I’ll never forget. The playlist was only four songs, and it defined why Grooveshark was perfect. Song 1: “One Blood (Remix)” — The Game featuring Jim Jones, Snoop Dogg, Nas, T.I., Fat Joe, Lil Wayne, N.O.R.E., Jadakiss, Styles P, Fabolous, Juelz Santana, Rick Ross, Twista, Kurupt, Daz Dillinger, W.C., E-40, Bun B, Chamillionaire, Slim Thug, Young Dro, Clipse, and Ja Rule  Song 2: “Dey Know (Remix)” — Shawty Lo featuring Ludacris, Young Jeezy, Plies and Lil Wayne  Song 3: “We Fly High (Beefmix)” — Jim Jones, Juelz Santana, and TIDAL’s Jay Z  Song 4: “300 Bars and Runnin” — The Game  At its peak, Grooveshark was a haven for the obscure. An online flea market for B-sides and C-sides, remixes of remixes, audio versions of music videos, things you heard on the radio once and were sure you’d never hear again. And free. So free.

77,"‘Fuller House’ Is Officially Coming, So Brace Yourself for These Other Inevitable Reboots","Back in the 1980s and 1990s and 2000s — before the world of reboots — there were simply things called “television shows.” These fossils were creations, based on nothing that previously existed, that were put on the air and loved by viewers. People laughed, people cried — people watched. Those days no longer exist. Bye-bye, those days. Because this is how we live in 2015. 1990s: Boy Meets World Adolescent Cory Matthews and his best friend Shawn, and Cory’s girlfriend Topanga attempt to survive the trials of high school, along with the help of the [sic] George Feeny, the high-school principal and Cory’s next-door neighbor. 2015: Girl Meets World Cory and Topanga Matthews are married and have two children. Their daughter, Riley, faces life lessons through her family, friends, and school — where her father is her history teacher — as her parents did when they were younger. The formula is easy. You just take something from the old show, fast-forward as many years as you need, and then, BOOM, you have a show and can do whatever you want. It’s genius, mainly because it doesn’t have to make any sense. As we learned last night from John Stamos on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, this trend shows no signs of slowing down.  The news of a Full House reboot has been in the air for weeks now. But now that Stamos has dropped the bomb, we know what it will be called. Fuller House. Yes, you’re reading that right, a reboot about a more full house. The premise of Fuller House: The revival series will focus on Candace Cameron Bure’s character, D.J. Tanner, who is a recently widowed and pregnant veterinarian. Her younger sister and aspiring musician Stephanie Tanner (Jodie Sweetin) and her childhood best friend, Kimmy Gibbler, (Andrea Barber), along with Gibbler’s feisty teenage daughter Ramona, move in to help D.J. raise her two sons — rebellious 12-year-old J.D. and neurotic 7-year-old Max — and soon-to-arrive baby. It’s so easy. It’s like applying the principles of an anagram to television creation. Just switch around a few things and voilà, new television. So of course this will happen to more of our favorite shows from the pre-reboot era of television. The Fresher Prince of Bel-Air (Yahoo! Screen) Nicholas Andrew Michael Shawn Nathan Wanyá Banks, a.k.a. Nicky Banks, the son of Vivian and the late Philip Banks, is now 22. After a year at Harvard Law, following four years at Yale, he drops out and decides to head back to California. With his mother (Aunt Viv Three, played by Laverne Cox) furious that he’s abandoned his academic pursuits, he stays with the only person that will take him in — for who he is — his older cousin Will (Will Smith). The forcibly straight-edged Nicky moves in, sharing a house with single-dad Will and his two children, Willow (Willow Smith) and Jaden (Jaden Smith). Siblings Ashley, Hilary, and Carlton all worry that living with Will and his free-spirited children could have irreversible effects on Nicky’s elite future. And it does, as Nicky begins to go by Yung Niché, starts putting rap songs on Soundcloud, and embeds himself with an arts collective, all while attempting to hide the fact that he grew up with a butler in a mansion in Bel Air. Sisters Sisters (Snapchat) Fifteen years have gone by, and now the Landry twins (Tia and Tamera Mowry) have both left their husbands. As expected, they got divorced on the same day, at the same time, in the same restaurant. Depressed, but eager to get back out there, they begin going to bars — separately — looking for a second shot at love. On the same day, each meets someone and can’t wait to tell the other, and meet the other’s mate. So they arrange a double date. On this double date, they discover what they never could have expected: Their new suitors are TWINS (played by Rondé and Tiki Barber). And to make it crazier, EACH MAN IS A SINGLE DAD. WITH TWINS. GIRL TWINS. AND THEY ALL LIVE IN THE SAME HOUSE, A HOUSE INTO WHICH TIA AND TAMERA WILL SOON MOVE. TWO MOMS, TWO DADS, THREE SETS OF SISTERS, FOUR TWINS, JACKEÉ IS IN EVERY EPISODE — LET’S GO. Homier Improvements (Grantland Network) Tool Time hosts Tim Taylor (Tim Allen) and Al Borland (Richard Karn) are dead, from a terrible accident involving tools. Determined to continue the legacy of his father, middle child Randy (Jonathan Taylor Thomas) reboots Tool Time — yes, this is a reboot within a reboot — as a podcast with the same name, but about tech gadgets. Internet tools. Hardware and software. You want to know about Chromecast? Listen to Tool Time. The show, Car Talk for Generation Q, becomes a hit, ultimately finding its way onto the Grantland podcast network, regularly recording on Mondays after Andy Greenwald’s weekly TV podcast about Sabrina the Middle-Aged Former Witch.",2015-04-21T14:34:12+00:00,TV,Browne
78,"Blue Magic: Welcome to Tidal, Jay Z’s ‘High-Quality’ Streaming Music Service","Earlier this month, Jay Z spent 56,000 racks1 on the acquisition of Swedish-based Aspiro, an online streaming music company. One of the brands under Aspiro’s umbrella is Tidal, a streaming service that made its way to the United States last fall. Today, at 5 p.m. ET, an announcement will be made about Tidal. You know it’s serious because there’s a countdown clock.  Without reading any material, it’s clear this is Jay Z’s gamble to challenge Spotify and Apple. But the site’s homepage also gives you the three-pronged mission of Tidal — how it plans to separate itself from the pack. High Fidelity sound quality, High Definition music videos and expertly Curated Editorial. When you begin digging into Tidal, Aspiro, and the streaming-music wars, an interesting X factor presents itself: sound quality. According to the New York Times, “Aspiro is one of a small but growing number of online music companies that have bet on consumers’ interest in improved sound quality.”  Reading this was shocking. Who knew that all of my music on Spotify, plus the seven songs I’ve purchased on iTunes this decade, wasn’t top quality? Personally, I thought the quality was great. But then I remembered my blissfully satisfied years of using dial-up, watching non-HD television, pre-1080p videos, and life before TSA pre-check. It’s hard to know that things need to get better until something better shows up — a something you didn’t even know needed to show up. But when that new something presents itself, your old, formerly satisfied self has no patience for the old way. We become disgusted by the old thing, almost to the point that we physically can’t endure the old thing. It’s like the Chrysler 300 saying: “It do look like a Phantom, until a Phantom pull up.” This is what Tidal appears to be targeting. And it’s a smart-ish gamble, considering that Dr. Dre is now approaching billionaire status because his team convinced the collective universe that our lives would be positively changed by adopting glorified earmuffs with slightly better sound. For years I used Delta in-flight earbuds because they were free and would last an entire two weeks. And I was happy, because they served the minimum purpose: playing music. But now when I’m forced to use them, it sounds like someone is banging a steel pipe with another steel pipe next to two screaming dolphins, next to that screaming goat. Banking on high definition and high fidelity seems like it could work (“expertly Curated Editorial” is simply a link to Grantland.com, so it’s a slight conflict of interest to discuss that wing of the company). At the very least, a precedent has been set of successfully tricking the public into paying money for such luxuries, so there’s that. Oh yeah — I forgot to mention that with Tidal comes money.  But there’s one other angle to Tidal that is not mentioned on the homepage: star power. Jay Z, no stranger to business casual performance art, has enlisted his powerful friends to get onboard.

79,Action Bronson Is a Great White Man,"I think I really understood Action Bronson when he threw on Toto. It all made sense at that moment. Standing alone in a sea of fans hanging on his every word — every move, every mannerism — at Manhattan’s Terminal 5 last night, I watched as the Flushing, Queens, rapper stomped around the stage, banging his head, gyrating in a frenetic, Joe Cockeresque way, as “Hold the Line” served as his battle cry. This was indisputably a rap show, but all of this oddity onstage made perfect sense. More Action Bronson A Highly Stoned, Deeply Weird Three Days on the Road with Action Bronson From Action Bronson to Yelawolf: A Field Guide to Today's White Rappers The corny fist pumps from the crowd mirrored the corny fist pumps from Bronson — that explained it all. That was when I truly understood Bronson as a cult hero incrementally becoming a mainstream figure. The show was a paradox for me. I felt out of place while also feeling welcome, and I never wanted it to end. Because I’d never seen white people so amped at owning their whiteness by essentially mocking their own whiteness. I couldn’t believe my eyes. The reason for the show, the second of two sold-out nights, was the release of Bronson’s major-label debut album, Mr. Wonderful. The build-up for this has seemed never-ending — his first mixtape, Dr. Lecter, was released four years ago — but the result was worth the wait. It’s an effortless record, with Bronson in complete control of his vision. When Bronson popped up on New York’s Hot 97 in January to rap on Funk Flex’s show, he showed off his virtuosity. The “freestyle”1 from that night is Bronson at his finest, reveling in absurdist topics, flashing his overconfidence, and rapping circles around anyone stepping up to a microphone.  That control — over how he raps and who he is — is evident immediately on Mr. Wonderful. The first five tracks are nearly 18 minutes of Bronson showing you how far he can stretch the Bronsolino persona. “Brand New Car” sounds like an ’80s TV theme; “The Rising” (with his right-hand man, Big Body Bes) and “Actin Crazy” are upliftingly grimy; “Terry” finds Bronson rapping over a slightly romantic beat; and “Falconry” (with Meyhem Lauren and Big Body Bes) is a classically rugged New York posse cut, perfectly juxtaposed with a surprisingly playful beat. The album is a big-boy step up from his 2013 mixtape, the great Blue Chips 2, but his weirdo skills are uncompromised. With producer Party Supplies as its anchor, BC2 stood out because it emphasized Bronson’s ability to rap over just about any beat thrown his way. The variety of production that he’s able to excel alongside is staggering — the pinnacle being “Contemporary Man,” with Bronson rapping over a blend of hits from Phil Collins (“Sussudio,” “Another Day in Paradise”), Peter Gabriel (“Sledgehammer”), John Mellencamp (“Jack and Diane”), Huey Lewis & the News (“Simple As That”), and Lisa Lisa & Cult Jam (“I Wonder if I Take You Home”).  While rhyming over “Sledgehammer,” Bronson tosses out the line “Just a white man excelling in a black sport, like I’m Pistol Pete.” At last night’s concert, when he got to that moment in the song, everyone was ready, myself included. It’s an amazing line that sheds light on why he’s so beloved and why he’s become so important. Backgrounds, where you’re from, where your grandma stay — this is what breaks down the barriers of communication between people. That moment you learn all [fill in the blank] aren’t the same, merely because they’re all [fill in the blank]. Bronson isn’t trying to pretend that race doesn’t exist. Which is why Bronson is important. Bronson is a white-boy hero in a practical, productive sense. In a world where young white people drape themselves in their own guilt over privilege — “Ugh, white people” sayeth the dutiful liberal white person — Bronson is excruciatingly refreshing. Unlike, say, Eminem in 1997, his understanding of his place in the culture feels uncomplicated. Standing in that room, packed with white kids brimming with pride over his performance, I got the sense that this had something to do with why they liked Bronson in the first place. ??? There are a handful of things in this life we can’t help. Two of those things are who gave birth to us and where we grew up. They’re decided before we have agency, and they dictate so much of our lives. Sometimes that works in one’s favor, and other times it’s a burden that one spends their entire life trying to overcome. Bronson lucked up. Because Bronson’s white, but Bronson’s from Queens. If he were from Portland, he might be perceived differently.2 But he’s from Flushing. The conditions he grew up in, who he grew up around, what he was exposed to, and who will cosign him — all of this matters. But Bronson never wants you to forget that he’s a hefty Albanian American Jewish dude from Queens who can rap better than most, is whiter than most, but has fans who look like some of everything. Near the show’s end, he rapped over Tracy Chapman’s “Give Me One Reason,” sang “I Need a Girl, Pt. 2,” and then did his version of Oprah’s Favorite Things. Just to Recap: Last night at Action Bronson's #MrWonderful show he threw 2 48"" TVs, 4 iPads, 1 Playstation 4 & 30 sandwiches into the crowd. — UPNORTHTRIP$ (@evboogie) March 26, 2015  He also gave away a Coogi sweater from the “Baby Blue” video (his song with Chance the Rapper), and while 30 sandwiches might have been the official count, I could have sworn it was 150.  Bronson is not my hero. But what he is able to pull off — this undeniable talent, this comfort in his own skin, this need to not code-switch — is heroic. As I watched him basking in all of his glory, all I could think was, Look at this glorious white boy go.",2015-03-26T16:57:58+00:00,Music,Browne
80,Searching for Josh Smith: Who Are the NBA’s Least Efficient Shooters?,"From teamwork to athleticism to intellect, basketball manifests the best humanity has to offer. While we all have our own obsessions within the game, I love the sequence that commences the moment a shot leaves a player’s hand. Everyone in the gym’s attention shifts, and nobody knows what might happen next: The shooter says a little prayer, rebounders simultaneously track the shot’s flight and jockey for position, and fans get to experience a brief moment of suspense. If the shot goes in, great — more points. But if the shot misses, the game totally changes form as rebounders fight for possession. This post-shot, in-between state is gorgeous. When Stephen Curry takes a shot, we can reliably expect for the ball to go in and the chaos to never arrive — which is why I love Josh Smith. Just more than 70 percent of the time he releases a 3-point shot, a future rebound gets its wings. The split second after a Smith jumper departs his left hand is like young love: emotional, fleeting, and magical.  However, since his move to Houston, things have changed, and I’m a little worried that the Rockets have ruined Josh Smith. He hardly ever takes those patented long 2s anymore, and for reasons that remain unclear, he is suddenly exhibiting above-average shooting efficiency from a couple of spots on the perimeter.  WHAT IS HAPPENING?!? I mean, look at that corner 3. I miss the good old days when Smith literally shot himself out of a guaranteed NBA contract. It seems as if the Rockets have “fixed” Smith, and much like the NBA’s decadelong search for the next Michael Jordan after MJ’s retirement, I’m looking for the next J-Smoove. The majority of this search has taken me up and down every lottery roster, but as luck would have it, a handful of future Smiths might even be getting some time come the playoffs. Without further delay, here are the least efficient shooters in the NBA. The Bucks acquired Carter-Williams in February. Why? Scholars remain unsure. It’s easy to argue that Carter-Williams is the least efficient volume shooter playing in the NBA. Consider these two facts: • Carter-Williams is the only player to take at least 200 midrange shots and make fewer than 30 percent of them. • Of the 202 NBA players who have attempted at least 100 3s, Carter-Williams ranks 200th in field goal percentage. In other words, he’s not quite Mark Price. The Bucks hope that Jason Kidd, who knows a thing or two about fixing a crooked jumper, can inspire the Carter-Williams reconstruction project. While there’s little doubt that improvements are possible, the current state is quite bleak: Jump-shooting guards have never been more important in the NBA, and Carter-Williams is a horrid shooter from virtually every spot on the floor. Parental advisory: The following graphic contains explicit imagery that is not suitable for young children.  With a nice group of young players, the Utah Jazz have the makings of a strong defensive team built around a suddenly beastly rim protector in Rudy Gobert. On the other end, the Jazz have one of the least effective finishing guards in the league: When Burke attacks the rim, opposing interior defenders morph into Gobert. This season, 167 players have attempted at least 200 field goals inside eight feet, and Burke is the second-least effective among them, converting a measly 42 percent of those close-range shots. But fear not, Jazz fans, for improvement is possible: Just ask Curry, who was really bad near the rim earlier in his career, only to turn into a very good close-range finisher.  If Noel continues to improve at his current pace, he is going to be a productive player for a long time. It’s clear he has what it takes to be a difference-maker on defense, but to turn into an effective offensive player, he has to become a better jump-shooter. As of Monday morning, 205 players had attempted at least 100 midrange shots, but none converted at a lower rate than Noel’s 27 percent. If he wants to be a great NBA player, this has to change.  Waiters is not only among the worst statistical 3-point shooters in the NBA, he also supplements his impotent blend of volume and inefficiency with an overflowing amount of unearned hubris and terrible defense. What’s not to like? If you’re looking for Waiters Island on a map, it’s right in the heart of Pacific Proving Grounds, where the U.S. tested nuclear weapons from 1946 to 1962. Nobody is allowed to go there anymore, as the islands are too contaminated — just like the blue archipelago along the perimeter of Waiters’s shot chart.  As it turns out, there can only be one Josh Smith. While none of these four players quite matches the vintage Smith’s bulk brick-launching, I truly believe that Waiters will be the closest thing we’ll have going forward. So if you have a missed-shot fetish like I do, come meet me on Waiters Island. We’ll have the whole place to ourselves.",2015-04-08T13:41:20+00:00,NBA,Goldsberry
81,The NBA’s Next Shooting Revolution Has Already Been Televised,"Michael Jordan’s Game 6 dagger from the 1998 Finals will be remembered for lots of reasons. The last shot of Jordan’s Bulls career, it may be the most iconic in-game moment of all of Jordan’s incredible career. It also might be the apex of the unassisted midrange jump shot, a symbolic John Henry moment at the dawn of a coming revolution.  Since that historic evening in Salt Lake City, the NBA has not only slowly moved away from Jordan, the superstar, but from his brand of isolationist midrange playmaking as well. And as we head into the 2015-16 season, the league has never been more concerned with efficiency. Today’s savviest players and coaches all shy away from the exact kinds of jumpers that the Jumpman made look so cool back in the 1990s. The basketball of the ’90s and early ’00s — the days of Jordan, Charles Barkley, Hakeem Olajuwon, Allen Iverson, and Kobe Bryant — calls to mind a certain aesthetic. The defense was rougher, the fouls were harder, and the playmakers played hero ball. Of course, memory does funny things — that’s not exactly how things were. But the offensive game has certainly moved out of the paint and beyond the arc, and the best squads play pass-happy team basketball. And they have a very good reason to do so. NBA scorekeepers have been meticulously hand-tracking every shot in every season since 1996-97. Every field goal attempt has been logged alongside key variables like who was shooting and where they were shooting from. This data set has not only enabled analysts to reveal which players can knock down which shots, it has also helped us understand key relationships between players, spaces, and shot efficiency. Now, thanks to the league’s data-rich player-tracking system — which has been standard in every pro gym since 2013 and captures the precise location of every player, ref, and the ball 24 times per second — we’re able to understand even more about shooting in the NBA. One takeaway from the data gathered from this tracking is that shots that immediately follow passes are much more likely to go through the hoop than their unassisted counterparts. The best kinds of shots result from teamwork, and the worst kinds are a result of selfishness. Last season, NBA players attempted just over 200,000 shots. Fifty-three percent of these shots qualify as assisted, while 47 percent qualify as unassisted.1 Overall, the league’s shooters converted 45 percent of their shots — the assisted tries went in 51 percent of the time, while the unassisted shots scored only 38 percent of the time. Andrew D. Bernstein/NBAE via Getty Images Gregg Popovich has a habit of having clever hunches. He had a hunch about the corner 3; he had one about international talent; he had another about minutes restrictions. So when he says2 that team assists are the first thing he looks at after a game, as an indicator for how well his offense has performed, you should probably pay attention. Player-tracking analytics are telling us that his feeling about the relationship between assists and offensive efficiency is also correct. A quick look at the top of the assist leaderboard from last season reveals that four of the NBA’s top five teams in assists per game also rank in the top five in shooting. In today’s NBA, sharing isn’t caring — it’s winning (or it’s just the best way to get buckets). Pop’s obsession with sharing the ball is nothing new. As you’ll recall, after the Spurs lost their only game in the 2014 NBA Finals, a frustrated Popovich took to the postgame presser and famously blurted out, “You move it or you die.” Popovich on ball movement: ""You move it or you die."" Spurs died tonight — J.A. Adande (@jadande) June 9, 2014  Move it or die. It might as well be the slogan for our current basketball era. Here, at the opening of the 2015-16 season, teams like San Antonio, Atlanta, and Golden State are doing the moving; teams like Kobe Bryant’s Lakers and Jordan’s Hornets are doing the dying. Andrew D. Bernstein/NBAE via Getty Images For years, spreadsheet cowboys and basketball cartographers have argued that midrange shots are the worst shots on the floor. They’re worth only two points, and, leaguewide, they go in just 40 percent of the time. A few feet further out, behind that magical point-inflating arc, you’ll find the land of 3s: a more alluring type of shot that goes in 36 percent of the time. You don’t have to be Daryl Morey to figure out how points per shot should inform shot selection.  This graphic visualizes some truths about present-day NBA basketball — namely that midrange shots are getting harder and harder to justify. But it fails to show the vital context. What kind of midrange shots are we talking about? You wouldn’t use the graphic above to tell Dirk Nowitzki or Chris Paul to stop shooting 2-point jumpers, would you? And just as there is a big difference between a Chris Paul midrange shot and a Lance Stephenson midrange shot, there is a similar difference between an average assisted midranger versus an average unassisted midranger. When shooters create shots on their own, especially midrange jumpers, they usually produce low-value attempts. This may not be news for people like Popovich, but the actual numbers we are starting to see are pretty striking.  The most foolish shot in the NBA is the unassisted midrange shot, a.k.a. the “on-my-own midrange field goal,” a.k.a. the OMFG. You can see above that shooting efficiency and passing are intertwined; shot sequences that include a preceding pass event are much more fruitful than ones that do not. On the left, you see points per shot for unassisted attempts, and we see darkness corresponding to very low values; on the right, we see points per shot for assisted attempts, and we see the light.  Last season, OMFGs accounted for about one in five shots across the NBA, but that high frequency isn’t matched by high efficiency. Leaguewide OMFGs yielded a meager 0.68 points per shot. That’s very low, considering that even an average Sixers possession yielded 0.93 points.  Of course, some players are incredibly adept at shot creation in the midrange, and players who create shots at will — especially those who convert them at high rates — should be considered extremely valuable. Even the best offenses in the league break down on a regular basis, and when this happens, it’s important to have players who can make something happen. With that in mind, guys like Chris Paul, Gordon Hayward, Jarrett Jack, Mike Conley, and Markieff Morris deserve some shine — they’re among the few shooters in the league who can take and make OMFGs over 40 percent of the time. Still, the main trend is undeniable: Just as teams with high assist rates tend to have high shooting numbers, OMFGs portend the opposite. As we look around the league at the players and teams that rely most heavily on OMFGs, an undeniable correlation emerges: Where we see frequent unassisted shots, we see bad NBA offenses. Scott Cunningham/NBAE via Getty Images Last season, the Jordan–owned Charlotte Hornets (Heir Jordans?) led the NBA by attempting 1,768 OMFGs. Now, there are several layers of management between the players on the floor and the Jumpman in the owner’s box, but still: There’s something poetic about the most iconic midrange jump-shooter of all time presiding over a team of midrange jump-shooters.  The Hornets had the unhealthiest shot diet in the league. More than one in four of Charlotte’s field goal attempts last season was an unassisted midranger. On average, these shots resulted in 0.64 points for the Hornets. They were very active in the midrange, and they were below average there too. And each time they took this kind of shot was one fewer time they were taking another, more valuable shot. The 2014-15 Hornets ranked last in effective field goal percentage and 3-point percentage and ranked 29th in overall field goal percentage. When you drill down on their individual players, you see how they arrived at the bottom of these team categories. Last season, 172 players (over a third of the league) attempted at least 500 shots. Of that massive group, three of the six least-effective shooters — Kemba Walker, Gary Neal, and Stephenson — played in Charlotte’s backcourt.3 Now that could be dumb luck, or it could be coaching and team philosophy. While it’s tempting to simply label players like Walker “inefficient,” that’s kind of shallow. Just as shooters are better with assistance from teammates, they need some from their coaches too. Who is assisting the assisters? Who is styling the offense? Coaches have a huge place at this table, and if you’re looking for evidence, look no further than our new overlords in Oakland. I know Steph Curry didn't do this last night. pic.twitter.com/BgIst8oRIj — Dynamics • £ (@theDYNAMICS) October 6, 2015  We think of last season’s Warriors as one of the best shooting teams we’ve ever seen, but they were also among the best passing clubs since Jordan left the game. There’s that coincidence again.  In a way, Jordan’s Hornets and Steve Kerr’s Warriors are extensions of their own playing careers. Kerr spent his career as a spot-up shooter. Almost every shot he took came after a teammate passed him the ball. Jordan spent his career as an offense unto himself. As players, they shared their primes together, winning rings in Chicago. Jordan helped Kerr reach the promised land for the first time. Now Kerr is there again, without him. Maybe it’s poetic, maybe it’s not, but that a team coached by Kerr is outperforming the one owned by Jordan has to say something about how this league is shifting. The iconography surrounding the Jordan legacy might suggest that unassisted jumpers line the stairway to basketball heaven, but the realities of the Popovich/Kerr era tell us they decorate the road to perdition. As we set out for a new season and a new set of 200,000 shots, the numbers leave little doubt that the glory days of the unassisted midrange shot are over. Hero ball is dead. It’s gone the way of the skyhook. You say you want a revolution? Well, it’s already been televised.",2015-10-13T09:54:04+00:00,2015 NBA Preview,Goldsberry
82,Roy Hibbert’s Hollywood Remake: How the Center and the Lakers Can Help Each Other,"Roy Hibbert and the Los Angeles Lakers need each other. One player, one team, both searching for a return to form. Five years ago, the Lakers won the franchise’s 16th NBA title. Since then, by way of their failed Dwight Howard–Steve Nash–Kobe Bryant superteam, they have slid into disrepair. Two years ago, Hibbert was the defensive anchor of an Indiana Pacers team that took the Miami Heat to seven games in the Eastern Conference finals. Since then, he’s been reduced to a shell of his former self. Hibbert served as the poster child for the Great Indiana Implosion of 2014-15, and he was told, in no uncertain terms, that he would be coming off the bench in the upcoming season if he stayed with the Pacers. He opted in, and he was promptly traded. And it could be the best possible outcome, for Hibbert and for L.A. The Lakers need all the help they can get, especially on defense. They ranked 29th in defensive efficiency last season after ranking 28th in 2013-14. That might be about to change, especially near the basket. If he does nothing else, Hibbert should improve the purple and gold’s rim protection.  The addition of Hibbert won’t turn the Lakers defense into the Iron Curtain overnight. At their recent peak, the Pacers were an amazing defensive unit, and Hibbert may have been the biggest reason for that, but he was by no means the only reason. He was supported by the kinds of tough, long, and willing perimeter defenders that made every pick-and-roll action a fight. Great rim protection begins on the perimeter, and Paul George, David West, George Hill, and even Lance Stephenson were basically the NBA Secret Service. Looking at the 2015-16 Lakers roster, it’s hard to identify anyone other than Hibbert who will be a plus defender. Nick Young is not Paul George; Lou Williams is not George Hill; 37-year-old Kobe Bryant is not 27-year-old Kobe Bryant. By any measure, the Lakers were a defensive tire fire last season, especially in the paint. Their opponents scored 18.9 field goals per game within 5 feet of the basket, third most in the league. The Pacers allowed only 14.8 field goals per game inside of 5 feet, second fewest in the league. For years now, Hibbert has been one of the league’s most effective “volume rim protectors.” Out of 40 NBA players who defended at least seven shots per game at the rim last season, Hibbert ranked fourth in opponent field goal percentage (42.6 percent) in those situations. Only Rudy Gobert, Serge Ibaka, and Andrew Bogut were more obstructive. That’s a crucial upgrade for the Lakers, who largely relied on Jordan Hill for rim protection last season. Hill ranked 38th in this group while allowing opponents to convert 55.4 percent of those shots. Hibbert’s offensive contributions have been more … enigmatic.  A player of Hibbert’s size should at least be an above-average scorer near the rim; he’s not, and his post moves remain way too raw for a veteran center making max money. His ability to shoot midrange jumpers is better than most people expect, but his mediocrity close to the basket remains the reddest of flags on his shot chart. It’s like he’s defending himself out there.  In a way, he is. Over the past two seasons, Hibbert’s confidence visibly deteriorated. As his former teammate David West said on his way out the door to San Antonio, “Roy wants to play, he knows he’s unpopular right now, but we talked and he’s going to be a professional. He’s always been a professional. He’s had his ups and downs but he’s always been a pro and been diligent about his work.” For a moment, Hibbert was the best at what he did, and what he did had value. But basketball moves pretty fast — and right now, it’s being played pretty small. The changes in the league and his shaky confidence have led him to Los Angeles, hoping for a Hollywood ending to his up-and-down career.",2015-07-16T08:14:58+00:00,NBA,Goldsberry
83,Superhero Ball: Breaking Down LeBron’s Historic NBA Finals Performance,"After Cleveland’s incredible Game 2 win in Oakland on Sunday, LeBron James sat on the podium and told reporters that he had a secret “motivation” driving him in this series. Who knew that being mysterious was a side effect of drinking too much LeBron’s Mix? Here’s my non-thirst-quenching theory: James believes he is the most valuable player in the NBA. Most of the reporters in that presser disagreed, and voted otherwise. And in Stephen Curry, LeBron is facing off against the guy those reporters deemed more valuable. He’s got a point to prove. It’s a familiar story. Michael Jordan logged what may be his best overall Finals performance in 1993, when his Bulls beat the Suns — and the NBA MVP, Charles Barkley — in six games. Everybody knows Jordan was the best player on the planet in 1993, but the MVP went to Barkley instead, perhaps because voters were sick of giving the award to Jordan, who had won it each of the previous two seasons. Jordan set an NBA Finals record by scoring 41 points per game that year, reminding everyone of the real definition of the word “valuable.” That record still stands, but perhaps not for long; James is averaging 41 points per game himself during this series.More 2015 NBA Playoffs Check out all of our postseason coverage!  If the Cavaliers lift the Larry O’Brien Trophy, they will do so because James boldly reestablished that he’s the most important player in the NBA. And it’s not close. It will make that MVP vote look a bit … questionable. After three games, Curry has scored 72 points, while LeBron has dropped 123. As Curry struggles to find his footing, James is hiking Kilimanjaro while wearing a tank top. And his guides aren’t doing shit. This is just incredible. Thus far, the defining image of the Finals is James, isolated, holding the ball on the left side of the court. He’s either about to attack the paint or jab-step and take a jumper.  Not all of his rim attacks have been this fruitful — those 41 points per game aren’t going to come easily against the best defense in the NBA. In fact, through the lens of field goal percentage, James is struggling — at least by his own high standards. During the 2013-14 regular season, James set a career high by making 57 percent of his shots. That dropped to 49 percent this season, and during the Finals it’s plummeted to 40 percent. A quick look at his shot chart from the Golden State series shows that he’s having trouble, especially in his favorite jump-shooting area, the midrange zone off the left block.  You don’t have to be Daryl Morey to know that the game isn’t won in the midrange these days. It’s won in the paint and beyond the arc. And while Curry may be the king of the 3-pointer, James still reigns in the paint. In the first three games, he has attempted 42 shots inside of 8 feet, which is as many as Golden State’s three most active close-range shooters combined. On the surface, it looks like that volume is missing James’s signature efficiency. However, a closer look reveals that the Cavs, incredibly, have rebounded more than half of James’s close-range misses in the Finals. James has been uncharacteristically off in the paint — making just 21 of 42 of his close-range attempts — but if you factor in conversions off offensive rebounds, that jumps to 33 of 42 (79 percent). Unsurprisingly, Tristan Thompson has been huge in this respect, recovering six of James’s 21 close-range misses by himself. Larry W. Smith Pool/Getty Images Away from the basket, James has struggled to find a rhythm. Beyond 8 feet, he’s converted just 22 of his 65 shots (34 percent). Still, that’s not terrible, and if he were 23-of-65 instead — if he’d made that fadeaway at the end of regulation in Game 1 — we’d be talking about the Cavs being on the verge of a sweep. James is also leading the series in assists by doing stuff like this for his teammates:  And this:  On the biggest stage, James is putting up video-game numbers. His per-game averages are insane: 41 points, 47 minutes, 36 field goal attempts, 13 free throw attempts, 12 rebounds, and eight assists. This is the pro version of LeBron that people dreamed about while watching high school highlights of him at St. Vincent–St. Mary — a crazy hybrid of Magic’s passing, MJ’s scoring, and Barkley’s interior presence. On the Heat, LeBron was the queen of the chessboard, overseeing sublime team basketball. In Ohio, he is the king. You can keep the MVP trophy. He wears the crown.",2015-06-11T08:39:04+00:00,NBA,Goldsberry
84,Are the NBA Playoffs Boring?,"Last night the Cavs destroyed the Hawks to complete an Eastern Conference finals sweep and punch their ticket to the NBA Finals. In some ways, the series was a perfect microcosm of the 2015 playoffs: plagued by injuries, not very close, and — let’s be honest — kind of boring. This much is clear, Spurs vs. Clips was the pinnacle of playoff basketball this year. What a letdown. — Haralabos Voulgaris (@haralabob) May 25, 2015  Maybe we’re just spoiled after riding the high of last year’s postseason. But it’s still worth asking: Is it me, or do these playoffs objectively suck? More 2015 NBA Playoffs Check out all of our postseason coverage! In the current format, a 16-team tournament featuring 15 best-of-seven series, the NBA playoffs contain a minimum of 60 games and a maximum of 105. Last year’s amazing playoffs not only featured five Game 7s but also included 89 total playoff games (5.9 games per series), which is tied with 2006 as the most ever. On the flip side, the 2007 playoffs represent the standard-bearer for boringness. That year saw LeBron James make his first trip to the Finals, but there were just 79 postseason games. The average series lasted just 5.3 games, and there was only one Game 7, which featured Carlos Boozer putting up 35 and 14 to lead the Jazz past the Rockets. Never forget, you guys. Bill Baptist/NBAE via Getty Images Just as some games are better than others and some series are more competitive than others, it follows that some playoff tournaments are simply better than others, and this year’s vintage tastes more like the 2007 — dry and bleak in color, with an austere opening followed by aromatic notes of barnyard on the finish. This is some Charles Shaw bullshit. Rajon Rondo saw it coming and got out while he could. Total games played is hardly a complete metric, but it provides a basic summary of how close the playoffs have been. In fact, since the league adopted the current format 12 years ago, the playoffs have included at least 81 games in every year except that lousy tournament in 2007. With somewhere between five and 10 games left this season, there’s a good chance we won’t get to 81. In other words, these dudes are leaving a lot of talking horse commercials on the table.  There are more numbers to back up the feeling that the average 2015 NBA playoff series has been uninteresting. More than half started with one team winning the first three games, which is not only terrible from an entertainment perspective, but is also highly unusual. Teams have jumped out to a 3-0 lead eight times this postseason, which Elias says is the second-most in NBA history.1 The average 2015 series has been just 5.4 games long, and if the Dubs win tonight, both sets of conference finals will have been even shorter than that. The Warriors and Rockets will tip off the 75th game of the 2015 playoffs tonight in Oakland. If the Warriors win and advance, we’ll add two more milestones of meh for this year’s tourney. It would be tied for the fewest pre-Finals playoff games since the league went to a best-of-seven format in the first round in 2003. It would also mean this year’s semifinals lasted only nine combined games, which is historically brief; dating back to 1970-71 (the first season this round was known as the conference finals), the fewest combined games in both conference finals is nine (1974 and 1986). Is something broken here? The players certainly are. I’m all for underdog stories, but nobody sits on their couch at the beginning of a season and dreams of Matthew Dellavedova squaring off against Shelvin Mack in the Eastern Conference finals. We watch the NBA postseason to see John Wall, not Ramon Sessions. Sure, injuries happen, but it’s pretty rare that an All-NBA ballot and a postseason injury report would look this similar. Chris Paul, Wall, Mike Conley, Kevin Love, Pau Gasol, Kyrie Irving, Wes Matthews, Dwight Howard, Chandler Parsons … we’re going to need a bigger MASH unit. When key players like those I just listed go down, there’s a domino effect. Rotations are thrown out of whack (hi, Hawks), offensive sets lack the same spark (hi, Nick Calathes), defensive mismatches abound, and the healthy players are forced to take on a greater workload (hi, Bulls). Last season’s playoffs sung because the best players on the best teams were playing their best basketball. This year, we got a couple of cool moments (“I called game”) and one series you could call a classic (Spurs-Clippers), and it happened in the first damn round. Rockets-Clippers was certainly interesting, but more because of the complete collapse of Los Angeles than any kind of sublime basketball. All season long, we anticipated the Western Conference playoffs like it was going to be a July 4 fireworks finale scored by the Boston Pops. It wound up being closer to a kid with a sparkler listening to “Uptown Funk” on a transistor radio. Structurally, this is the exact same architecture that delivered the 2014 masterpiece. But it’s worth noting that, given the kind of massive conference imbalance we have now, the current system is vulnerable to boringness. As I and countless others have written, there are many reasons to simply put the teams with the top 16 records in the playoffs and seed it straight. The biggest reason?

85,Bay Area Bellwether: How the Improvement of Harrison Barnes Mirrors Golden State’s Ascent,"If you check the syllabus for Warriors 101, you’ll find many assigned readings on the Splash Brothers and the Principles of Bogut, while of course much of the curriculum will be devoted to the masterful ascent of Draymond Green. But tucked in among the optional-readings section, you’ll notice what might initially seem like a less important lesson: that of the Bay Area Bellwether, Harrison Barnes. Over the past year, no jump-shooter in the league has improved as much as Barnes. Out of 136 players who attempted at least 300 jump shots both last season and this season, no player exhibited a bigger uptick in field goal percentage: from 32.8 percent to 40.3. Barnes may not be a Splash Brother, but his jumper has gone from bad to good in a very short time. His most significant gains have come beyond the arc, and it’s not an exaggeration to say that he’s becoming one of the most reliable forwards in the league from downtown. Nowhere on the floor is that more apparent than over in the right corner, where he was the most effective shooter in the NBA this year. Just look at the rest of the top five.1 It’s basically the jump-shooting Illuminati: 1. Harrison Barnes: 58.5 percent
2. Kyle Korver: 56.9 percent
3. Anthony Morrow: 55.7 percent
4. Danny Green: 55.4 percent
5. Klay Thompson: 52.7 percent    But the thing about corner 3s is that they’re not really individual accomplishments; leaguewide, 95 percent of them involve an assist. Barnes’s improvements in the corner offer a perfect microcosm of the Warriors’ improvement overall: Not only have the individual players improved, but the team is more cohesive and more tactically intelligent than it was a year back. Much of this has to do with Steve Kerr replacing Mark Jackson, but it’s also the byproduct of a team chock-full of young talent that is developing at a rapid pace.  Barnes has exhibited great strides as both a jump-shooter and an attacker. As you can see, he’s suddenly very reliable, going from subpar to above average in both the corners and the paint in the span of one season. In some ways, Barnes is the quintessential player of 2015. Not only is he a stretchy power forward who can knock down 3s in the corners, but on defense he epitomizes the newish trends of flexibility and versatility. As he demonstrated in his breakout performance against Memphis,2 he’s strong enough to defend a big power forward like Zach Randolph and quick enough to switch onto guards, too. Just, for the love of god, don’t put him on Courtney Lee again.  Thankfully, he survived that moment of inhuman flexibility and remains an important and representative part of the Warriors’ title hopes. Last season, after the Dubs acquired Andre Iguodala, Barnes found himself being the creative force on Golden State’s second unit. That’s not a good role for him; he’s not a front man. If the Warriors were the Beatles, Stephen Curry would be Lennon, Klay Thompson would be McCartney, and Barnes would be Harrison. Ever since Kerr made the call to put him in a more complementary position in the starting five, Barnes has flourished. With the Black Falcon at the 4, here come the Dubs.",2015-05-21T12:39:33+00:00,NBA,Goldsberry
86,"Mission Control: Daryl Morey Didn’t Make the Rules, He Just Knows How to Win With Them","Sunday afternoon in Houston, the Rockets completed their surprising series comeback against the Clippers to advance to the Western Conference finals. Normally, a 2-seed getting to the NBA semifinals is not particularly noteworthy, but anytime the Rockets do anything, it means it’s time to discuss basketball analytics again. This is groan-worthy for many reasons, but that won’t stop the partisans from assuming their positions and treating us all to another cycle of reheated takes on the virtues of numbers and hoops. Whether he wants to be or not, Daryl Morey is the poster boy for analytics in pro basketball, and though analytics have infiltrated virtually every front office in the league, Morey’s successes and failures still must also be referenda on the state of analytical reasoning in the NBA. Morey became general manager of the Houston Rockets in May 2007. Eight years and what seems like 10 million transactions later, they are the furthest they’ve been with him at the helm. The last time the Rockets made it to the Western Conference finals was 18 years ago, with a team led by Hakeem Olajuwon, Clyde Drexler, and Charles Barkley. Maybe it’s ironic that Barkley attempted to verbally eviscerate Morey early this season, and maybe it’s not, but it’s definitely poetic justice that Barkley will have to bite his lip and continue to analyze Morey’s team as it competes in the NBA’s final four.  Barkley’s midseason rant was all the talk at the 2015 MIT Sloan Sports Analytics conference in Boston this February. It’s a conference that Morey cofounded with Jessica Gelman nine years ago and has tellingly exploded in popularity ever since. The idea that analytical reasoning has no place in basketball is so ridiculous that it barely warrants recognition. Yet if Barkley’s tirade taught us anything, it’s that there are still people out there who think this way. And that itself is an issue that challenges us to examine why basketball lifers like Barkley have come to adopt such an extremist dogma.More 2015 NBA Playoffs Check out all of our postseason coverage!  Make no mistake, Barkley may be the most prominent proselytizer, but he’s not alone; his viewpoint is shared and echoed, albeit in more nuanced terms, by many coaches and decision-makers in the NBA. The truth is that if the 2015 Rockets are symbolic of anything, it’s that it takes all kinds of genius to make a really good NBA team these days. From player development and coaching to scouting, drafting, and transacting, good franchises are good at a lot of things, and number-crunching is a useful component in many contemporary front-office tasks. Morey spearheads a forward-thinking front office that has built a sustainable enterprise, and while there’s no question analytics are part of that, they’re by no means lonely. Perhaps the most revealing lapse in Barkley’s analysis came when he unknowingly praised Morey, the wheeler-and-dealer.  Check out the convenient pronoun usage there. Who are they? Morey is they, and “they” pulled off the best trade our league has seen this century when “they” flipped Kevin Martin and what turned out to be Jeremy Lamb, and picks, into that bearded breakfast defector who happens to be one of the best players in the NBA right now. Scott Halleran/Getty Images You might argue that the James Harden trade had little to do with analytics, but something tells me that Houston’s little intelligence agency did a bit of quantitative surveillance before deciding to pull the trigger. Furthermore, that trade — and the preceding transactions that enabled it — set the table for luring Dwight Howard a year later. Howard had options, but he chose Houston, in part, because of Harden. Morey’s Rockets résumé has more than those two bullet points. He may have lost the Chris Bosh sweepstakes and let Chandler Parsons walk to Dallas, but by grabbing Trevor Ariza and Jason Terry he landed two savvy vets who have contributed a lot for much lower costs. In addition, he could’ve appeased the hot-takers and fired Kevin McHale, but he didn’t, and that proved wise, especially after he acquired Josh Smith and Corey Brewer in the middle of the season. McHale somehow assimilated those guys, turning Smith into a playoff difference-maker who resembles a madman’s Boris Diaw. This team has survived numerous injuries, insults, and death pronouncements, and is still alive and kicking as we approach Memorial Day. It’s incredible. It should be clear to anyone paying attention that Morey is far from a one-dimensional numbers nerd who happens to run an NBA team; he’s one of the league’s smartest managers, and in the midst of the big-data era, like every other successful decision-maker, he’s not about to turn a blind eye to computation or statistics. Still, at least from a stylistic standpoint, the defining trait of these Rockets might be their progressive shot selection. And it speaks volumes about Morey that he’s been able to translate what started as an idea at Sloan into a viable offensive strategy we’ll all be watching in the freaking Western Conference finals.  Regardless of which team wins this series, the 2014-15 Rockets will have a legacy. More than any other team, they make us think about how the rules of the game and the lines of the floor affect the way the sport is played. You can argue that they play ugly basketball, and you might be right, but you can’t argue that they don’t play really smart basketball. They exploit loopholes and margins better than any other team, and last I checked, that’s generally a smart competitive strategy in any game. As I wrote in January, It’s not Morey’s fault that the league decided to paint a magical arc on the court that not only drastically inflates the value of a 24-foot jump shot, but also deflates the value of midrange jumpers and makes paint shots the only sensible 2-point shots on the floor. And it’s certainly not his fault that getting a good free throw shooter to the free throw line is secretly the most effective play in professional basketball.1 There are three smart places to score on the court right now: beyond the arc, near the rim, and at the free throw line.  These are the rules, and Morey has gone out and built a team that exploits those rules. Howard is obviously a beast near the rim; Harden is a master rim attacker, jump-shooter, foul-drawer, and 3-point assister; the rest of the squad is more than happy to decorate the perimeter and shoot 3s all day long. If you hate the way the Rockets play, your problems aren’t with Morey — they’re with the competition committee and the league office. And if you hate analytics? Well, go root for the Lakers, who have an 82.8 percent chance of keeping their lottery pick tonight.",2015-05-19T14:04:07+00:00,NBA,Goldsberry
87,Jimmy Butler’s Sweet Charity: How Drives and Free Throws Unlocked the Chicago Guard’s Offense,"If the only thing Jimmy Butler could do was this …  or this …  … he would have a career in the NBA. Yet the fourth-year Marquette product has become much more than a defensive menace. Over the past few seasons, he has gradually morphed into a multifaceted offensive weapon, making him perhaps the best all-around player on a team that has a decent chance to get to the NBA Finals (if it can just get past these pesky Bucks). You’d be hard-pressed to find a more rapid case of player development outside of Kawhi Leonard in San Antonio.  In a few short years, Butler has become a much more effective jump-shooter and a terrific attacker. Looking at Butler’s shot chart from just two years ago, it’s hard to believe it shows the same player who is now scoring 26.6 points per game in the postseason. When Derrick Rose suffered his first major knee injury, the 2012-13 season became a huge opportunity for Butler, then in his second campaign, to emerge as a key contributor for the Bulls. The reality was that Butler just wasn’t ready, and he put up only 8.6 points per game, while typically shooting from only a few discrete locations on the court. He was a low-usage, low-efficiency scorer.  That’s the shooting chart of a very raw offensive player. There’s no activity near the elbows or above the break, two zones where many wing players make their hay. Fast-forward to this season, and suddenly Butler is among the most versatile and unique scorers in the Eastern Conference. It’s a remarkable transformation — not only has he developed a much more diverse scoring portfolio, he’s become much more efficient at the same time.  Just a few years ago, Butler was a train wreck beyond the arc (compared to other shooting guards). Now he’s doing stuff like this:  Still, as impressive as that shooting growth has been, the biggest element of Butler’s offensive evolution doesn’t show up on a shot chart. At some point in the last year or so, he has cracked the code to the NBA’s most efficient scoring action: getting to the line. A routine shooting foul elevates the value of an average NBA possession more than almost any other single action. Last week, I described how just getting Kyle Korver an average look transformed the Hawks into an insanely efficient offense. Generally speaking, anytime the Hawks get Korver any kind of shot, they score an incredible 1.34 points per possession. Butler is a phenomenal foul shooter — anytime he draws a shooting foul, he gets his team 1.67 points per possession.1 It may not be pretty, but it’s definitely effective. And the good news for Bulls fans is that very few young players get to the line as much or knock down their free throws as much as Butler.  During the regular season, Butler drew a whopping 5.2 fouls per game. Only five NBA players shot more free throws per contest: Most Free Throws per Game Whether we want to admit it or not, the league’s best players are also its best ref-whisperers. Butler went to the stripe more often than many superstars, including hack magnets like Blake Griffin, Dwight Howard, and Anthony Davis. While those wonky foul stats may seem trivial at first glance, don’t be fooled. All of those trips to the line represent something really meaningful. At the very least they indicate that Butler has become quite difficult to guard, but they also tell us that he has a mature awareness of the charity stripe’s value. And if we know anything about Butler, it’s that the dude likes to get buckets.  Butler’s development is evidence of the ripple effects that stem from becoming a better jump-shooter. NBA defenders love to sag off of guys who can’t shoot, which in turn makes it very difficult to attack the basket. By improving his jump shooting, Butler also greatly improved his driving — not to mention the Bulls’ overall offense. According to SportVU data provided exclusively to Grantland, Butler drew fouls on 25 percent of his drives this season. Leaguewide, drives only result in foul calls 13 percent of the time. The Bulls scored 1.23 points per possession each time he drove. Considering that the team averaged 1.05 points per possession, that’s pretty good.  Those drives are among the most influential factors in the Bulls’ fate in the playoffs. The Bulls become a much more dangerous offense when either Rose or Butler is attacking the basket. Whether they are getting fouled, getting buckets, or creating for their teammates, you’d have a hard time finding a better pair of attackers anywhere in the league. Call them the Slash Brothers. It was three years ago this week when Rose first hurt his knee and the future of the Bulls franchise was put on hold. If the orthopedists can stay away, the future is back. Rose may never be the same ferocious talent he was before his ACL broke down, but he’s still pretty darn good. And in Butler, he now has one of the best two-way shooting guards in the league by his side.",2015-04-29T13:15:20+00:00,NBA,Goldsberry
88,The Other Guy: Klay Thompson on His Sensational Season,"On Monday night in Oakland, the Warriors beat the Pelicans to take a 2-0 lead in their first-round playoff series. This was the first real test of the seemingly unstoppable Warriors home juggernaut. Eric Gordon nailed a 26-foot 3-pointer, cutting the Warriors’ lead to one, with 6:16 left in the fourth quarter. That’s when Klay Thompson went to work. On the ensuing possession, he came off of an Andre Iguodala screen and coldly knocked down a tough catch-and-shoot jumper.  Shortly after that, he dished the ball to Draymond Green for a bucket. On the next Dubs possession, he came off of a curl and drained another elbow jumper. It was suddenly a six-point game, and he wasn’t done. Two minutes later, he would ice the contest with an and-1.  When the Warriors needed to wrestle the game back from the Pelicans, Thompson scored or assisted on every bucket. He ended up with 26 points on just 17 shots, playing big in the game’s biggest moments, scoring 14 huge points in the fourth. Anthony Davis and Steph Curry were on the floor, but Klay was the most valuable player last night. We think of 2014-15 as Thompson’s breakout season, but until one night in January, he was arguably the Art Garfunkel of the NBA: the ultimate “other guy” in the league’s best backcourt. Then he logged what might be the single most insane 12-minute scoring surge in NBA history. It was a performance so breathtaking that it forced the media to abandon the Splash Brothers frame and, for once, take a look at Thompson as an individual threat.    The official scorer’s report from that magical quarter at Oracle has become a collector’s item within the Warriors organization: 13-for-13 from the floor, 9 3-pointers, 37 points, 12 minutes. Insanity.  It was like Thompson had found a secret cheat code for NBA Jam, except it was real life. Everything he put up found the bottom of the net.  I caught up with Thompson a few weeks ago at the Warriors’ team hotel in Dallas, less than 24 hours after his team beat the Suns with a buzzer-beater back in Oakland. Thompson said his path to jump-shooting greatness began as a teenager in Orange County. “I started to realize I could really shoot my sophomore year in high school,” he said. His jumper began to take shape under the tutelage of one of the most respected youth coaches in Southern California, Joedy Gardner.1 Thompson played on some of Gardner’s AAU teams and attended twice-weekly workouts with him in Mission Viejo. Gardner also had the respect of Klay’s father, former pro Mychal Thompson, who called him “one of the best shooting coaches in the entire country” back in 2009. “There was one drill that stands out,” Klay Thompson said. “He’d have me shoot through a Hula-Hoop to help me get my balance right, make sure that I wouldn’t have too much going forward, backward, or sideways.” The Hula-Hoops worked; Thompson has arguably the prettiest catch-and-shoot form of any player in the league.  He was generally unheralded coming out of high school, but Thompson enjoyed a nice three-year run at Washington State before entering the 2011 draft. This old scouting report from Draft Express seems spot-on four years later: Relying heavily on his perimeter shot … Thompson is constantly moving without the ball and coming around screens, showing a great knack for finding open areas of the floor and being multi-capable once the ball gets in his hands. Making quick decisions and showing good scoring instincts, Thompson doesn’t usually have the ball for that long before it leaves his hands.  Thompson has applied those skills brilliantly as a pro, launching more than 4,000 shots in his career and making more than 40 percent of his 3s each year. But that success is more impressive when you also consider that he has elevated his shooting volume every season too. His rookie year, Thompson attempted 4.1 3-pointers per game; this season, that number climbed to 7.1. Only two other players in the league attempted more per game from long range; one of those just happens to be his backcourt mate. That’s the scariest thing about the Splash Brothers — it’s not just their efficiency, but the way they combine that efficiency with volume. Out of the five players in the league who attempted more than 500 3s this year, Curry and Thompson were the only two who converted more than 40 percent of those shots. Any NBA team would be thrilled to suit up even one of these guys. The Splash Brothers are not identical twins. The contrast in their games is one of the coolest things about them. As a point guard and ballhandling savant, Curry creates unassisted 3s better than anyone in the NBA. On the whole, 84 percent of NBA 3s involved an assist this season, but only 58 percent of Curry’s 3s were assisted. Thompson, on the other hand, is a pure catch-and-shoot guy — 91 percent of his made 3s were assisted this season. Unlike Curry’s triples, Thompson’s long-range buckets almost always punctuate those gorgeous ball-movement sequences that have become common in Oakland.  If Curry gives the Warriors the best perimeter-scoring ball handler in the playoffs, Thompson provides them with one of the league’s finest off-the-ball threats. And if there’s one thing that Steve Kerr has improved in his first season as the team’s coach, it’s tactical movement. Perhaps no player has benefited more from Kerr’s arrival than Thompson. “I move side to side across the court a lot more,” he said, “instead of just standing in the corner, being an outlet.” Thompson isn’t the only one cutting more. At any given time, all five of the team’s players are moving. “I think our fluidity is so great this year,” said Thompson. “All three of our perimeter players and our two post guys who handle the ball are in constant movement.” As a catch-and-shoot specialist, Thompson’s opportunities depend on his teammates and the offense. His impressive shot chart from this season is a celebration of both his dead-eye shooting and the overall functionality of the Golden State offense.  Thompson is willing and able to shoot from anywhere, but his accuracy from the corners is particularly great. This season, 36 NBA players attempted at least 100 corner 3s. Thompson ranked third in shooting efficiency in this group, hitting a whopping 51 percent of those shots, behind only Kyle Korver and Anthony Morrow. Thompson made 65 corner 3s during the regular season, and all 65 were assisted. In a way, Thompson’s rise this season is perfectly microcosmic of his team’s rise. It’s not that the Warriors were bad last year, it’s that they had an offensive breakout this year. “We’re getting better shots. We’re not settling for isolation or one-on-one. We got so many talented guys on this team that can shoot, handle the ball, and pass, and if something’s not there in one or two dribbles, we’ll just move the ball on and make the simple play,” he said. Less than a year after many NBA observers viewed Thompson as trade bait that could turn into Kevin Love, the Bay Area is now very thankful that swap never materialized. Thompson is no longer just “the other guy.” He’s become a cornerstone player on the best team in the league. Just ask the Pelicans — if any of them can manage to hear you, that is.",2015-04-21T14:31:28+00:00,NBA,Goldsberry
89,Kyle Korver Is the Best Shooter in the NBA — and It’s Not Particularly Close,"A quick look at Kyle Korver’s stats reveals that he’s a pretty darn good shooter — 49 percent on 3s during the regular season, ranked third in the league in total triples made — but those basic stats fail to capture just how special he has been this year. A deeper examination of his shooting data reveals that Korver is something closer to a jump-shooting messiah. This year, Korver scored 805 points on 600 field goal attempts. As this chart shows, most of those shots came from beyond the arc:  That certainly looks good, but using shooting data from the whole league, we can compare Korver’s yield to what the output of an average NBA shooter would be from the same constellation of shots.  If an “average” NBA player had attempted the exact same collection of shots as Korver this season, he would have scored 1.04 points per shot. That’s not bad, but guess what? Korver accumulated a dizzying 1.34 points per shot. During the regular season, the Clippers led the NBA by scoring 109.8 points per 100 possessions. The Hawks averaged 134 points per 100 possessions any time Korver took a shot. In other words, whenever the Hawks just manage to get Korver a decent look, they immediately transform into an offensive juggernaut. And judging by the bench’s “premature” reaction here, they are well aware:  By the end of the regular season, Korver had accumulated 182 points more than an “average” shooter would have from his exact same shooting opportunities. Once you account for volume, it’s clear that Korver had the most efficient scoring season in the league by a wide margin. Points Above Average Shooter per 100 Shots1 1. Kyle Korver, plus-30.2
2. DeAndre Jordan, plus-17.4
3. J.J. Redick, plus-17.2
4. Stephen Curry, plus-17.0
5. Brandan Wright, plus-16.6 And while we’re here, let’s check in on the worst shooters: 1. Lance Stephenson, minus-20.0
2. Michael Carter-Williams, minus-19.4
3. Elfrid Payton, minus-18.1
4. Solomon Hill, minus-17.3
5. Dion Waiters, minus-17.3 After 75 regular-season performances, Korver built one of the scariest shot charts I’ve ever seen. But he didn’t do it alone. Catch-and-shoot guys need smart tactics and great teammates to help them get good looks, and more than 95 percent of Korver’s buckets this year involved an assist.  The Hawks remain a legitimate threat to win the Eastern Conference because of Korver, but also because they have the coach of the year in Mike Budenholzer and a band of other great players working together to find the best shot on the floor. However, with all due respect to All-Stars like Paul Millsap, Al Horford, and Jeff Teague, Korver is the team’s scariest weapon.",2015-04-22T16:03:37+00:00,NBA,Goldsberry
90,"True Browmance: How Tyreke, Jrue, and Gentry Can Help Anthony Davis","Anthony Davis is the best young player in the NBA. Last season, he led the league in Player Efficiency Rating. Still, Davis competes in an unforgiving Western Conference landscape, where having one lone superstar means nothing. So while the Pelicans can head into the 2015-16 season with one of the game’s truly phenomenal players, it remains unclear if they have the supporting parts to take full advantage of the Brow in his prime. A quick refresher course on Davis’s brilliance: Last season, he ranked fourth in the league in scoring and converted 54 percent of his 1,199 shot attempts. He merged production and efficiency better than anyone else in the NBA. Of the league’s top 40 scorers, only five made more than half of their shots, and nobody made a higher share than Davis’s 54 percent. Oh, and he’s 22 years old. Davis is a vastly more effective scorer after receiving passes from teammates than he is in unassisted situations. And while he has the impressive ability to create his own shots, Davis is at his best as the punctuation mark at the end of a playmaking sentence, rather than as the whole sentence himself. This kind of ball-sharing dependence is by no means unusual in the NBA, but nowhere is it more pronounced or more critical than it is in New Orleans. Looking at the Brow’s assisted/unassisted scoring splits, it’s clear that the easiest path to improving the Pelicans offense is an increased number of catch-and-score plays for the team’s superstar. Last season, Davis made just 40 percent of 452 unassisted field goal attempts (0.8 points per shot); that ranks 40th out of 76 NBA players who tried at least 400 unassisted shots last season. To put that into context, Rajon Rondo was more efficient in those situations. However, Davis converted a ridiculous 62 percent of 747 assisted attempts (1.24 points per shot), which ranked third out of 83 players who tried at least 400 such shots. Glenn James/NBAE via Getty Images Enter Alvin Gentry, New Orleans’s new head coach and coauthor of some of the league’s most brilliant playmaking outfits, including that splashy laser show in Oakland last season and the Seven Seconds or Less Suns, which changed the way we look at offense. Not a bad résumé. The Pelicans hope that Gentry can repeat that feat for them. But he can’t just plug those Warriors or Suns strategies into place in New Orleans. Gentry inherits a Crescent City roster that lacks a floor general on the level of Stephen Curry or Steve Nash. He will have to make do with Tyreke Evans and Jrue Holiday. That’s where things get interesting. Big year #takeflight pic.twitter.com/a6z46d9pFc — New Orleans Pelicans (@PelicansNBA) September 28, 2015  From an analytical perspective, few players are more fascinating than Evans. He compensates for his much-maligned jump shooting by being one of the most aggressive attacking wings in the league. According to the NBA’s player-tracking data, Evans racked up 940 drives last season, the most in the league. Of the five most prolific interior producers in 2014-15, each is under 27 and four1 are at least 6-foot-10. Tyreke is a 6-foot-6 wing player; how in the world is he on a list with these giants? He’s crashing the party, in the same way that he crashes his way into the paint for the Pelicans on a regular basis. Evans is the Kool-Aid Man of the NBA. Oh yeah!  At first glance, Evans’s shot chart is a horror show — it looks like he’s below average almost everywhere on the court. But you have to take into account those drives and the havoc they generate. Of all the league’s top-tier interior producers, Evans is the only guy who largely creates those buckets for himself. Only 27 percent of his 392 close-range field goals are assisted, by far the lowest assist rate of anyone near the top of the list. A vast majority of Evans’s chances near the rim come off of dribble drives that often compromise the shape of the defense. This is a valuable act, even if it doesn’t result in a bucket for Evans. The Pelicans rebounded an absurd 47 percent of Evans’s close-range misses last season; the league average in that zone is 38 percent. Out of 33 players who missed at least 200 shots within 8 feet of the rim, Evans’s shots produced the second-highest offensive rebounding rate, trailing only James Harden, the league’s no. 1 purveyor of havoc.  Evans converts only a subpar 51 percent of his close-range shots (the NBA average is 55 percent in this zone), but that’s only half the story. Almost three-quarters of his close-range attempts resulted in either a bucket or a fresh 24 via an offensive board. Remember, possessions that begin with offensive rebounds are extremely valuable (1.22 points per possession leaguewide), so guys who create those possessions at abnormal rates should be identified as valued, albeit unconventional, playmakers. As a drive-happy wing with a mediocre jumper, Evans is about as unconventional as they come. He led the NBA in Kobe Assists last season, thanks in large part to human Hoover vacuums Davis and Omer Asik. The more you look at Evans’s game, the more you think of Harden. In 2015, that is a huge compliment.  Last season, Pelicans shooters attempted 1,039 shots immediately following an Evans pass; only nine NBA players generated more, and a remarkable 15.3 percent of Pelicans shots came off of Evans passes. The most important person Evans passes to is obviously Davis, and he does it well. Twenty-five percent of Davis’s 2014-15 field goal attempts came within two seconds of catching an Evans pass, and the Brow converted 58 percent of those chances. During the 2014-15 campaign, Evans was thrust into the role of primary playmaker when Holiday was injured. About that: To say Holiday’s health is an ongoing concern would be a huge understatement. The former Sixer has missed 90 games over the past two seasons due to issues with his right leg, and it was revealed this summer that Philly may have known a lot more about Holiday’s injuries than it let on. In fact, during the offseason the Pelicans quietly received $3 million in remuneration from the Sixers as a result. The whole thing is shady as hell, and it evokes the grossest aspects of the Jeff Green debacle from a few years prior. Holiday’s health will be a huge factor in Gentry’s ability to retool and improve the team’s offensive style. Even if Holiday is available, it sounds like his contributions will be limited until at least the new year. When he was on the floor last season, Holiday was the team’s most effective distributor. The Pelicans averaged a whopping 1.28 points per shot on the 472 catch-and-score opportunities that came after his passes. That ranked eighth in the NBA out of 83 players who generated at least 400 catch-and-score chances. That efficiency climbed all the way to 1.36 points per shot when Holiday targeted Davis. For context, the Clippers led the NBA by scoring 1.09 points per possession last season. In a league obsessed with the pick-and-roll, the combination of Holiday and Davis represents the biggest growth area for Gentry’s Pelicans. Holiday is a strong ball handler, and has scoring ability, and is creative enough to facilitate opportunities for the team’s superstar. Since Davis entered the league a few years ago, we’ve all grown accustomed to him using his freaky athleticism to make DeAndre Jordan–like finishes off of lobs, like this:  But unlike Jordan, Davis has developed into an incredible midrange shooter, making him even more of a pain in the ass to defend after screens.  That shot is the cornerstone of Davis’s development as an offensive weapon. He didn’t have it as a rookie; he’s got it now. He’s already one of the best jump-shooting bigs in the game, especially in those tactically vital pick-and-pop zones beyond the elbows. Holiday can generate looks from those spots on a regular basis — he just needs to stay healthy.  Gentry has said that Davis will play the 5 more often, meaning that Ryan Anderson could provide the team with a nice small-ball 4, capable of spacing the floor in terrifying new ways. In such scenarios, that Holiday-Davis pick-and-roll would be even harder to stop. Anderson’s silky jump shot can easily lure the defense’s second big away from the paint, freeing up Holiday and Davis to terrorize the center of the court with their beautiful two-man game. And with Eric Gordon and Anderson decorating the edges, Holiday and Davis can make opponents pay for cheating inward. Gordon will never be mistaken for a great playmaker, but he is easily the team’s most dangerous long-range shooter, and he’s particularly great above the break. Last season, 63 players attempted at least 200 3s above the break. Of this group, only Kyle Korver hit a higher share than Gordon, who knocked down a blistering 45 percent of those attempts. Since landing Davis in 2012, the Pelicans have done a nice job of bringing him along and turning him into the league’s next great superstar. Now they have to turn his teammates into an elite supporting cast. This will be Gentry’s main job this season: making the house look as good as the foundation.",2015-09-30T10:51:43+00:00,2015 NBA Preview,Goldsberry
91,The Ballad of Dez and Tony: Visualizing the Cowboys’ Lethal Quarterback-Receiver Combo,"Last December, early in the second half of the Dallas-Chicago game, the Cowboys had the ball — first-and-10 on their own 44. Tony Romo took the snap, dropped back about 4 yards, and launched a high arcing bomb down the left side of the field. It was the kind of throw quarterbacks only attempt when they know they have a superb receiver racing under it. The ball descended back to earth around the Bears’ 15-yard line, in the general vicinity of Dez Bryant and two defensive backs. Those defenders never stood a chance.  This is the NFL’s equivalent of getting posterized, with Bryant playing the role of DeAndre Jordan. I mean, just look at this: He’s a full half-a-human-being above the defenders. David Banks/Getty Images In 2014, Bryant and Romo combined for a league-best 15 touchdowns. (Aaron Rodgers and Jordy Nelson, second with 13, will sadly not have the opportunity to best that tally this season.)  Touchdowns are one thing, but yardage is another. On average, the Cowboys gained over 10 yards every time Romo targeted Bryant. Only one tandem averaged more yards per attempt: Andrew Luck and T.Y. Hilton.  Last season, Romo set a career best in passer rating, recording an impressive 113.2 over 15 games. He was even better when Bryant was his intended receiver — on 126 Bryant targets last season, Romo’s passer rating jumped all the way to 125.2. Breathtaking big plays might be their trademark, but they were extremely competent when it came to more ho-hum exchanges. Last season, 32 quarterback-receiver tandems had at least 100 pass attempts, and only two of those pairings (Rodgers–Randall Cobb, Eli Manning–Odell Beckham Jr.) were more efficient than Romo-Bryant, according to passer rating.  This chart shows every time Romo targeted Bryant last season. There are 86 completions against only 40 incompletions, and 15 touchdowns against only five interceptions.  Romo led the league in long-range touchdowns last season, with 14 of his 34 touchdowns targeting receivers at least 15 yards downfield. Bryant had eight of those 14. But just because he’s a deep threat, don’t let the highlights fool you. Bryant’s also become an incredibly adept short-range receiver. Like all great wideouts, he’s a threat all over the field, and his talent has greatly helped Romo’s recent success.  While passer rating remains the most popular metric to evaluate a quarterback’s overall performance, a quick look around the league reveals that these ratings fluctuate wildly depending on who is doing the route-running and the catching — or, in some cases, the dropping. After all, every NFL pass attempt involves at least two relevant actors. Consider the strange case of Eli Manning. Last season, he logged an overall passer rating of 92.1. Not bad, not great. His two top targets were the phenomenal Beckham and the not-so-phenomenal Rueben Randle. Manning targeted Beckham 128 times and Randle 122 times. However, Beckham ended the year with 91 catches, while Randle tallied only 69. When targeting Beckham, Manning had a passer rating of 128.5; when targeting Randle, he had a rating of 75.2. In other words, Manning was better than Aaron Rodgers when targeting Beckham and worse than Geno Smith when throwing to Randle. It turns out dudes who can do this help pad “passing” stats.   So much for passer rating. There are examples like this all over the league. Still, while it’s clear that passer rating, QBR, and almost every quarterback stat is greatly influenced by receivers (not to mention linemen, coaches, and defenses), football analysis remains overly obsessed with our beloved ball-throwers. From sports radio to fantasy football, quarterbacks are always the headliners. This is certainly the case with Romo. Quarterbacks deserve a lot of attention — they are by far the most important performers on the field — but they are by no means alone. Looking back at Bryant’s magnificent catch in Chicago, there’s no doubt Romo made a good throw. But only a small handful of players could reliably turn that kind of optimistic heave into a completion. That’s the value of Bryant, Beckham, Calvin Johnson, and a few other members of the ball-catching illuminati. It’s not that Romo can’t be good without Bryant. He certainly could be. Whether he could be great is another question.",2015-09-03T08:39:46+00:00,2015 NFL Preview,Goldsberry
92,"Spotting Spot-ups: Danny Green, DeMarre Carroll, and the Complicated Calculus of a 3-Point Shooter","This free-agency season has meant a lot of things to a lot of people, but one of the undeniable takeaways is that 3-point specialists have never been more valuable. In the time of Daryl Morey, Gregg Popovich, and Steve Kerr, so-called spot-up guys, who were once relegated to the status and salary level of “role players,” are quickly climbing the stairway to basketball heaven. Since July 1, Danny Green and DeMarre Carroll, who were both essentially on the NBA scrap heap a few seasons ago, have each agreed to four-year deals worth a combined $105 million.1 Taken together, their new contracts reveal just how quickly the league’s economic realities are changing. 2015 NBA Free Agency Check out all of our free-agency coverage! But here’s the thing about spot-up shooters: More than just about any other type of scorer, their performances depend on external factors. Even the best catch-and-shoot guys live and die by the ability of their teams to create the kinds of shots they thrive on; Tom Thibodeau’s Kyle Korver was a lot less scary than Mike Budenholzer’s version. Yet while there is no shortage of evidence to support this idea, there is a shortage of teams that are capable of generating wide-open catch-and-shoot looks beyond the arc on a regular basis. And every time a big-name spot-up guy switches uniforms, he and the team acquiring him are taking on all the risk that comes with changing a shooting environment. Consider this cautionary tale: Vince Carter converted almost 40 percent of his 371 3-point attempts with Dallas in 2013-14. On the back of that success, Carter signed with Memphis, where he proceeded to make just 30 percent of his 3s. What happened last year? Did Carter’s ability to shoot 24-foot jump shots suddenly fall off of a cliff? Or was the landscape too crowded for him to find the right kind of looks?  Mario Chalmers provides another great example of how dependent upon environment shooters can be. Chalmers himself didn’t even switch teams, but LeBron James did. When LeBron took his talents (and assists) back to Cleveland, the wide-open catch-and-shoot looks dried up, and Chalmers’s effectiveness beyond the arc plummeted.  Although one guy gets credit for every made 3-pointer, the truth is that the majority of long-range shots come as a result of some combination of teamwork. Across the league last season, 84 percent of triples were assisted, and for spot-up guys like Carroll (99 percent) and Green (94 percent), that number was even higher. In other words, these dudes are not Steph Curry, who excels at creating his long-range looks off the dribble. Instead, they need help getting their shots, and when a guy like Carter switches teams, he risks landing in a spot where that help doesn’t exist in the same way it had before. Through one lens, Carter looked like he would be a perfect fit in Memphis. In Dallas, he’d become a really good spot-up shooter, and in 2013-14 Memphis had ranked dead last in 3-point production, so: need met. However, in retrospect it looks like he joined a team that was incapable of creating the looks he got in Texas. He didn’t just suddenly become a mediocre shooter, but by leaving the land of Nowitzki and Carlisle, his spot-up habitat immediately became less hospitable. Trevor Ariza made a similar gamble last summer, but with vastly different results. He ended up being arguably the best spot-up bargain on the free-agent market (four years, $32 million), but he took a huge chance when he left John Wall and Washington and signed with Houston. Wall is among the top 3-point generators in the league, and he and Ariza had developed great pass-and-catch-and-shoot chemistry. Not only did Wall lead the NBA in corner-3 assists during Ariza’s last year with the Wizards, but he was the assister of record on 61 percent of Ariza’s made 3s. Still, Ariza saw a chance to do the same thing with Houston, the most 3-happy team in the league, and the move paid off. He set career highs in both 3-point attempts and 3-point field goals with the Rockets last season. He deserves massive amounts of credit for this, but he also has James Harden to thank; Harden led the NBA in 3-point assists last season, and ended up assisting on 80 of Ariza’s 194 triples. Most of the league’s 3-pointers are more like touchdown passes than home runs; they involve a key interaction between two offensive players. And perhaps no player is more aware of how much context matters than Green. Many observers were surprised that he took a “discount” last week to stay in San Antonio on a four-year, $45 million deal. However, Green was a journeyman before linking up with the Spurs, where he suddenly turned into a spot-up demigod.  While we have to credit Green’s hard work and willingness to adapt for much of his improvement, we can’t forget that his rise coincided with playing in one of the best jump-shooting environments in the league. With that in mind, his decision to stay in San Antonio makes a lot of sense.  Like Green, Carroll recently underwent his own long-range renaissance. Before joining the Atlanta Hawks in 2013, Carroll had never made more than 20 3-pointers in a season. Last year, he made 120 on 40 percent shooting. It was a breakout performance, but again, we have to ask: How much of it had to do with the brilliant spacing and ball movement of Budenholzer’s offense? The Hawks trailed only the Rockets in 3-point assists last season, and 92 percent of their triples were assisted. Carroll was almost completely teammate dependent: He made a grand total of one unassisted 3 all season long. By leaving Atlanta and moving to Toronto — a team that ranked 28th in 3-point assist rate last year — Carroll, who’s getting $15 million more than Green, is putting a lot of faith in symbioses that may or may not come to fruition. Like Carter, his numbers might look a lot different next season.  It’s a weird calculus, but in a league increasingly driven by analytical reasoning, it’s obvious that more and more teams constantly use numbers to evaluate the fit of certain players. Guaranteed money will always be the trump card, but maybe it’s time for players to get a little more nerdy themselves and shine that analytical light back onto the teams. When a player like Arron Afflalo decides to sign a short-term contract with a terrible offensive team like the New York Knicks, he’s not only reducing his chance of winning basketball games, he’s threatening to also reduce his perceived value when he hits the market again in two short years. Arron Afflalo made 53% of his open 3s last year; that's awesome, but can the Knicks create open looks on the edges? pic.twitter.com/2730dZbzYB — Kirk Goldsberry (@kirkgoldsberry) July 2, 2015  Spot-up shooters serve as the indicator species of contemporary NBA ecosystems. They flourish in the spacing of San Antonio, Golden State, and Atlanta, but struggle among the crowds in New York, Memphis, and Lakerland. Many times their numbers reflect just as much about the health of their shooting environs as they do about the ability of the individual shooter himself. After all, if you’re a catch-and-shoot specialist in the best basketball league on the planet, chances are you’re already pretty good at shooting a basketball.",2015-07-10T12:26:00+00:00,NBA,Goldsberry
93,Outsider Artist: Understanding the Beauty of Steph Curry’s Jumper,"Everybody has tried to shoot a basketball at least once. Most of us aren’t very good at it. Many have tried it 10,000 times or more,1 just trying to hone the skill, hoping to eventually summon something close to reliability. It rarely happens. And even though launching a basketball at a hoop is one of the most widely practiced activities in American sports, every once in a while someone comes along and makes it look like something only he can do. Stephen Curry was drafted into the NBA in 2009. Since then, over the course of 7,000 field goal attempts, he has made the jump shot his own art form. In the same way John Steinbeck built masterpieces from everyday language or Robert Rauschenberg constructed artwork out of popular culture signifiers, Curry is taking the familiar mechanics of shooting to incredible new heights, and he’s turning the basketball court inside out as he does it. Maybe it’s the quickness of his release, or the way he seamlessly transitions from handling to shooting. Maybe it’s the unusually steep parabolic slope his shot cuts from his hand on its way to the bottom of the net. Whatever it is, Curry is more than just the NBA’s most valuable player — he’s also its most breathtaking. Every time Curry rises up and lets a long-range jump shot fly, it’s one of the most riveting moments in sports. That’s due in no small part to its beauty; it’s so certain in its creative intent that it can feel more like you’re witnessing a work of art than an athletic act. At the end of a career-changing season, and on the cusp of Curry’s first trip to the NBA Finals, let’s take a closer look at his palette.    There’s never been a player like this. When Curry is hot, he can make a 3-pointer look as effortless as a clear-lane layup. He is changing how we think of 3-point shooting, and he’s doing it as a point guard. Point guards aren’t supposed to lead the NBA in made 3s, let alone break Ray Allen’s shooting records. Curry doesn’t care. He may play in Oakland, but in the parlance of nearby Silicon Valley, he has disrupted the perimeter market by doing things his own way. Now he’s the CEO of the most exciting start-up venture in town.  Usually, 3-pointers are catch-and-shoot affairs. A playmaker wreaks havoc somewhere in the middle of the floor, defensive help collapses on him, and the playmaker finds the open man on the perimeter. The shooter collects the pass, sets his feet, and rises for a relatively clean, unfettered look at the rim. After all, it takes time and space to launch a 9-inch-wide ball through an elevated 18-inch-wide metal ring located 25 feet away. As a result, 84 percent of NBA 3s involve an assist, and 76 percent of 3s do not involve any dribbling by the shooter. But, of course, these typicalities do not apply to Wardell Stephen Curry II.  It’s not that Curry isn’t a good catch-and-shoot guy — he most certainly is. He tied for ninth in the league by knocking down 136 no-dribble 3s this season, hitting at a ridiculous 47 percent clip. As you can see above, he’s absolutely lethal in the corners, which is almost exclusively a catch-and-shoot zone. But while those are admirable numbers, catch-and-shoot specialists seldom make the All-Star team, let alone walk away with the MVP trophy. Something else is going on here.    It’s telling that the NBA’s top two MVP candidates — Curry and Houston’s James Harden — happen to be the best at creating unassisted 3s. But with all due respect to the inventive skills of Harden, Curry is the patent-holder of the unassisted triple. Nobody on earth can self-generate beyond the arc like he can. This season, the Denver Nuggets ranked 11th in the NBA with 106 unassisted 3s. Curry had 118 by himself.  NBA players convert 35 percent of their 3-point shots, but while catch-and-shoot attempts go in 37 percent of the time, off-the-dribble 3s go in just 32 percent of the time. Curry is far and away the best off-the-dribble long-range shooter the NBA has ever seen. Not only does he lead the league in made off-the-dribble 3s, but out of 11 guys who attempted at least 150 of those shots, he’s the most accurate. Most Made Off-the-Dribble 3-Pointers in 2014-15
1. Stephen Curry, 147 (43 percent)
2. James Harden, 110 (36 percent)
3. Damian Lillard, 103 (33 percent)
4. Chris Paul, 90 (40 percent)
5. Lou Williams, 88 (31 percent) That doubles as the list of the most creative jump-shooters in the NBA. You’ll notice that Curry ranks first in both volume and efficiency. To put his conversion rate in perspective, that 43 percent effectiveness translates to a whopping 1.27 points per shot. Remember, the Clippers led the NBA in offensive efficiency rating by posting 1.1 points per possession. Anytime Curry can get a 3 off, the Warriors are downright terrifying. Oh, and in a related story, Curry led the NBA in 3-point attempts. And in another related story, the Warriors are in the Finals. During the regular season, Curry broke his own NBA record by draining 286 3s. Over half of those came off the dribble, and nobody in NBA history has ever been able to generate — and convert — his own looks like this. It’s not just that Curry is a great shooter, it’s that Curry is the most creative great shooter ever. Noah Graham/NBAE via Getty Images Numbers are one thing, and aesthetics are another. One reason we howl with glee when Curry scores is that he makes hard shots look so freaking easy. The quintessential Curry highlight involves a few slick dribbles and a lightning-smooth release that a defender just can’t get a hand to. The dunk will always be the most exciting play in basketball, but draining a long-range shot in the face of a defender is right up there.  There are a few intricacies of Curry’s technique that enable him to be both extremely consistent and seemingly reckless. First of all, he has one of the quickest releases in the league. As highlighted in this terrific Sports Science piece from last season, Curry can gather his dribble and release his shot in about 0.4 seconds, much faster than the average player.  Furthermore, thanks to an unusually steep shooting trajectory, in the time it takes an average NBA player to gather and shoot the ball, Curry’s ball has already made it 12 feet above the surface of the court. Good luck trying to block his shot. Even if you can get a hand in his face, Curry is the best in-traffic jump-shooter in the NBA. Since 2013-14, the NBA has used its fancy tracking system to catalogue the precise locations of every player in every game 24 times per second. We’re now able to evaluate how the distances between shooters and defenders affect field goal accuracy. Unsurprisingly, the closer defenders are to shooters, the less likely shots are to go in.  But these numbers do not apply to Curry. As you can see, NBA shooters make less than 30 percent of their 3s when a defender is right up on them, but they make 44 percent when the closest defender is 12 feet away. Curry makes 44 percent of his contested 3s. Let me make this totally clear: Curry is as good with a guy in his face as the average NBA shooter is when wide open. We all know that the league is shooting more 3s than ever, but as defenses adapt, shooters will have trouble finding spaces to shoot from. The thing about Curry is that a crevice is all he needs. While it’s hard to overstate the magnificence of Curry’s long-range prowess, the glare from its brilliance has obscured some of the less-hyped developments in his game. Over the past two years, Curry has become a beast in the paint. And I’m not just talking about him boxing out Dwight Howard in the playoffs. Out of 50 players who attempted at least 350 shots within 8 feet during the 2014-15 regular season, Curry ranked eighth in field goal percentage, converting 63 percent of those attempts. That’s a higher conversion rate than Howard, Marc Gasol, and Blake Griffin. Remember when some people thought Curry was soft? Now he’s able to blend volume and efficiency near the paint as well as any point guard on the planet.  It wasn’t always this way. As recently as two years ago, if there was a weakness in Curry’s offensive game, it was his ability to score in the paint. During the 2012-13 season, Curry converted just 49 percent of his shots in this same close-range area — well below the NBA average of 55 percent. In fact, out of the group of 168 players who attempted at least 200 shots inside of 8 feet that season, Curry ranked 151st in field goal percentage. Over the past two years, though, he has transformed one of the few weaknesses in his scoring portfolio into another mighty weapon. Just like he does on the perimeter, Curry has found ways to keep bigger, more athletic defenders at bay with smart, quick, quirky releases that are high in the air before shot-blockers even know they’re happening. It’s hard to imagine someone so relatively slight having such a huge impact on the game. But that’s what Curry is doing — in the same way a great artist changes the way we see the world, he’s changing the way we see basketball. Suddenly, our ideas of risky shot selection, of off-balance attempts, of what is and isn’t “long distance” have changed. About 20 years ago, in the time of Jordan, sharpshooters like Dell Curry (Steph’s dad) and Steve Kerr (Steph’s coach) were niche contributors, mostly relegated to role-player status. Oh, how things have changed. Stephen Curry is the avatar of a new, long-range NBA. As the Finals begin, the 3-point show will be the main attraction, with Curry the starry dynamo at the center. He seems poised to paint his first masterpiece on the league’s biggest canvas.",2015-06-04T07:54:33+00:00,NBA,Goldsberry
94,Board Games: How DeAndre Jordan’s Rebounding Supercharges the Clippers,"With All-NBA phenoms Chris Paul and Blake Griffin, it’s no surprise the Clippers possess the most efficient offense in basketball. Paul has been a magnificent floor general for years, and Griffin continues to evolve into one of the game’s best scoring forwards. But with the play of DeAndre Jordan this year, the Clips have added another dominating component that puts them over the top: the most proficient rebounder in basketball. During the regular season, Jordan ranked second in the NBA in offensive rebounds, and the Clippers led the league in offensive efficiency by scoring a whopping 109.8 points per 100 possessions. However, according to SportVU data provided exclusively to Grantland, the Clips put up an insane 129 points per 100 possessions after a Jordan offensive rebound. Possessions that descend from Jordan’s offensive rebounds are essentially “super possessions.”  While offensive rebounds extend possessions, they also basically function like accidental entry passes, leading to a relatively large player suddenly possessing the ball close to the basket. According to Phil Jackson, that’s why they’re part of the holy trinity of effective offense: Basketball is a simple game. Your goal is penetration, get the ball close to the basket, and there are three ways to do that. Pass, dribble and offensive rebound. When Jordan is able to recover a missed shot on the offensive end, his best option is often to immediately try to put it back in the goal himself. Not coincidentally, the NBA leaderboard for putbacks looks a lot like the offensive rebounding leaderboard, and Jordan’s 114 putbacks this year were third-most in the NBA — behind Andre Drummond (167) and Enes Kanter (124).  Granted, Jordan is fortunate enough to share the floor with two great individual scorers who demand loads of defensive attention. While that may open up space for Jordan to swoop in and grab any misses, it also gives defenses another thing to worry about after successfully shutting down Paul or Griffin. Jordan was the janitor of the NBA’s two most prolific “misser/offensive rebounder” duos in the entire league, grabbing 83 of Paul’s misses and 80 of Griffin’s.1  The Clippers decorate the offensive end of the court with a near-perfect ensemble of talents, and Jordan gives them a dominant interior force. His shot chart may look comically predictable, but keep in mind that the restricted area is the hardest place to score in the NBA, and Jordan excels down there: 
During the regular season, Jordan converted 373 close-range field goals, including 252 dunks. He ranked third in the league in close-range production and matched that elite yield with an equally impressive efficiency level. Out of 38 players who averaged at least five shots per game within five feet, Jordan ranked third in field goal percentage by converting 74 percent of those attempts. His offensive game may not be fancy, but he blends volume and efficiency in the restricted area as well as anybody in the league. As for the other end of the floor, just as his offensive boards breathe new life into seemingly failed possessions, his defensive rebounds prevent the opponent from achieving that same kind of reincarnation. Among qualified players, nobody in the NBA pulls down a higher share of available defensive rebounds than Jordan, who posted a ridiculous 32.3 percent defensive rebounding rate. In addition to dominating the glass, he’s also a volume rim protector who defends more shots than anyone else in the league.2 And while he doesn’t disrupt opponents’ efficiency as much as guys like Roy Hibbert do, on average he still reduces the likelihood that an opponent’s shot will find the bottom of the net. Jordan might not be the best defensive player in the league, but he very well could be the most important. Those rim protection skills are really valuable, but make no mistake: His rebounding should be the top bullet point on his résumé as he tests free-agency waters this summer. Simply put, every basketball team in the world needs guys to clean up the glass, and there are few, if any, players in the league you’d want chasing down rebounds more than Jordan. During the playoffs, he’s gained a reputation as the guy who shoots crooked free throws in between talking horse commercials, but Jordan’s obviously much more than that: Few players in the league breathe fresh life into his team’s offense more than him, and nobody turns defense into offense more reliably than he does. While his rebounds might only show up as one number in a box score, their value extends way beyond a single data point. As we’ll find out this summer, they’re probably worth something closer to eight figures.",2015-05-06T13:48:21+00:00,NBA,Goldsberry
95,NBA Shootaround: Pick-and-Rose,"So much amazing is happening, and the Shootaround crew is here to help you keep track of it all. You’ll find takes on moments you might’ve missed from the previous night, along with ones you will remember forever.  Kirk Goldsberry: Did you see Rihanna in that showstopping yellow Guo Pei gown at the Met Gala last night? Well, it looked like a peasant’s smock compared with the haute couture Derrick Rose dumped all over Cuyahoga County. Rose scored 25, stirred a stiff pick-and-roll drink, and saved his best for crunch time as the Bulls took Game 1 on the road. More 2015 NBA Playoffs Check out all of our postseason coverage! Not only did he help spur a huge 15-0 run in the third quarter, but when the game got tight in the fourth, Rose also took matters into his own hands with an MVP-vintage trio of sequences, beginning with about 4:30 remaining and his team clinging to a fragile three-point lead. Trip 1: How does a human even make this pass?  The next two trips featured the suddenly unstoppable two-man game of Rose and Pau Gasol. Trip 2: Rose used a throwback burst of speed to split the defenders and nail his patented floater, only to be called for a bogus charge. Note, it’s a bogus charge because LeBron clearly took a little hop after Rose left his feet.  Trip 3: Rose again used the Gasol screen to attack the paint, this time throwing another impossible pass back to Gasol, who knocked down a wide-open jumper. Pau hit six jumpers from above the free throw line, and Rose wreaked havoc in the paint all night.  David Blatt’s gonna earn his money if he can figure out a way to stop that pick-and-roll pairing. Good luck with that, Blatt.  Ah-woooooo.  Chris Ryan: Behold the four corners defense, as pioneered by the garbage-time Houston Rockets. I would say that Kevin McHale’s players were sanitation workers last night, but I have too much respect for sanitation workers — they work way harder than the Rockets did. Above, you will see James Harden watching noted whirling dervish J.J. Redick fly through the lane for a mildly contested, over-the-shoulder floater. This took place late in last night’s Game 1. I don’t really subscribe to the Charles Oakley school of All Men (Who Go for a Postseason Layup) Must Die, but at least make an effort, you know? It’s not like Houston wasn’t well rested. If L.A. had come into the building and more or less punted on Game 1, giving starters like Blake Griffin ample time on the bench next to the injured Chris Paul, I don’t think many people could blame them. Instead, Griffin put up a triple-double, played point forward, and led his team to a huge win. Los Angeles looked like a team that had just beaten the defending NBA champions. The Rockets looked like a bunch of guys who had spent the last week high-fiving each other for crushing Charlie Villanueva in five games. Last night, Houston was front-running, looking for easy outs, and got stomped in its own gym. Is that assessment a little unfair? Yes. Is my perspective on this game somewhat influenced by the 47 combined turnovers and witnessing 20 DeAndre Jordan and Dwight Howard free throw attempts? It has taken 11 minutes to play 26 seconds.

The team has championship aspirations, and is located in the second-largest media market in the country. Austin Rivers’s teammates include some of the most famous athletes in professional sports. They do nationally televised commercials. Austin Rivers is not a particularly good basketball player. We all know that, but the particular context of his badness stacks the deck of misery unfairly against him. Austin will never get to be anonymously bad. Not now.  To be fair, he’s not nearly as bad as he’s made out to be. That said, Rivers spent much if not all of Game 1 against the Rockets playing like germophobe-era Howard Hughes trying to get out of a gas station bathroom. It feels weird to talk about Rivers like this, after he scored 17 points, shooting 4-of-6 from 3, and in the wake of a Clippers win over a shockingly uninterested Rockets team. But there is one moment of his game that truly distinguished itself in its level of shookness. The warning signs were there early, I guess. Little things, like Blake Griffin pointedly running the break himself several times with Austin on the court. Then this:  There’s Austin, driving top speed, at an elderly Jason Terry, dribbling behind his back and falling down, as his lower body violently rebels at the level of coordination being asked of it, and the ball skitters away. He gamely tries to swipe at it, like a man whose hat has just blown off and is now tumbling down the street to a life free from tyranny. This play made me sad deep inside of my chest.  Especially the part where Austin raises his arms at the refs, the world, and the gods above, like, “Yo, did you see that foul?”",2015-05-05T09:17:58+00:00,NBA,Goldsberry
96,Final Four Illustrated: The 10 Most Important Scorers in Indianapolis,"As you may already know, four of the NCAA’s most reliable college basketball programs will take the floor on Saturday in what promises to be a great night of hoops. There are countless reasons to watch: If you like coaches, several icons will be prancing along the sidelines. If you like the NBA draft, several lottery picks will be playing the biggest games of their lives. If you like Jim Nantz, well, he’ll be there, too. But also, if you like watching teams with varied offensive approaches — superstar-centric, balanced, or otherwise — lock horns, this weekend should provide plenty of fascinating matchups. More March MadnessAll the Grantland coverage of the 2015 NCAA tournament, right here.Of course, any conversation about the Final Four begins with Kentucky, the undefeated behemoth poised to make history in Indy. One of the obvious reasons the Wildcats are so hard to beat is that they have an unmatched array of weapons. Despite all of the talent, John Calipari’s squad is way more than just a collection of random AAU parts. Calipari not only gets these whiz kids to play amazing defense together, but he also has built an egalitarian offensive attack that spreads the load fairly equally among its top five or six scorers. There’s no one person to stop — just many to fear.  Despite those relatively even numbers, as the Notre Dame game demonstrated, Karl-Anthony Towns provides the Wildcats with an old-fashioned offensive centerpiece. Towns is a monster near the basket, and as soon as he gets a low post touch, defenses face the unenviable choice of either sending a double-team, which will compromise the shape of their defense elsewhere, or taking their chances with a lone defender, which is what the Irish died doing last weekend. Towns’s shot chart is simple, but basketball is pretty straightforward when you can score like this in the paint.  However futile Notre Dame’s defensive strategy seemed, it may have been the right approach. The Wildcats feature a litany of snipers more than capable of draining the kinds of open 3s that double-teaming Towns inevitably creates. Devin Booker is not only the best shooter on Kentucky, he’s one of the best shooters in all of college hoops. Calipari uses him in the corners and along the wings to spread the floor and make opponents pay for overloading elsewhere. You could even make the argument that leaving Booker open beyond the arc is more dangerous than trying to defend Towns with a lone interior defender.  If Booker’s not feeling it, opponents might have a chance. Just kidding: If Booker’s having an off night, then Aaron or Andrew Harrison will fill it up from deep. Kentucky’s ferocious inside-outside attack will face another big test Saturday night against the Wisconsin Badgers, a.k.a. Frankie and the Fundamentals.  While Calipari and Kentucky confound opponents with their democratic attack, there’s no question about who spearheads the Badgers offense. With the ability to score in both the paint and beyond the arc, Frank Kaminsky has the game of a really good, modern NBA power forward. Like Chris Bosh, he can post you up or stretch you out. However, with Towns and Willie Cauley-Stein patrolling the paint, Saturday’s game against Kentucky will really test Frank the Tank’s ability to score against NBA-caliber interior defense. Can Kaminsky show the world that he’s capable of dominating massive defenders? Or might this be the end of the line for the Badgers?  Wisconsin punched its ticket to the Final Four by ousting a fantastic Arizona team. In that victory, the Badgers were able to supplement Kaminsky’s reliable offense with 27 huge points from Sam Dekker. While he’s nowhere near as consistent as Kaminsky, Dekker still approaches scoring in a very similar way: He’s really strong near the rim, but as he showed when he iced the game against Arizona with that high-arcing moon-ball, he’s also capable of knocking down 3s.  Man, who doesn’t love Duke? What else can you say?  It’s obviously easier said than done, but stopping the Blue Devils begins by stopping Jahlil Okafor. The future top-two draft pick is Duke’s leading scorer and probably the best low post player in college basketball. On Saturday, Michigan State’s bigs — Matt Costello, Branden Dawson, and Gavin Schilling — will have their hands full trying to contain Okafor’s seemingly limitless arsenal of highly polished post moves.  As you can see, virtually all of his points come in the deep paint and around the blocks. When you can score this well down there, why even try anything else? Now, Okafor should be the focus of any defensive attempt to beat Duke, but these Blue Devils will punish any team that throws too many resources at stopping the big man. Specifically, guys like Justise Winslow, another possible lottery pick, and Quinn Cook, the team’s senior leader, will make opponents pay with rim attacks and triples. Winslow, who has the best name in the Final Four, is a versatile and athletic scorer who can drain 3s and attack the rim off the dribble. His favorite shot is the 3 from the left wing.  Like Kentucky’s Booker, Cook is a constant spot-up threat whose function is to keep opponents honest, especially along the wings and in the corners.  Duke’s formula is simple: beat you inside with Okafor and beat you outside with jump shooters. However, as clean as that approach is on paper, they’ll have to do it against a team that has a habit of making good offenses look terrible. In the interests of journalistic transparency, it is here that I must admit I was a professor at Michigan State for four years and have no ability to be objective when it comes to Spartan basketball. Now, this may not be Tom Izzo’s most talented team, but they’re back — a bunch of Burger King All-Americans, scrapping and toiling their way to the NCAA’s blue blood showcase.  Izzo always seems to have some of the most charismatically tough players in college basketball, and this year is no exception. Denzel Valentine, a Lansing native and the son of an accomplished high school coach, is not only the heart and soul of this MSU team, he’s also the most “Ginobili” of any player in the Final Four. In other words, he’s equally as likely to make an amazing play as he is to throw the ball into the stands. It’s beautiful and maddening, but as goes Valentine, so go the Spartans. He’s probably State’s most important playmaker, but the guy’s a pretty good scorer, too.  For all of his importance, Valentine certainly didn’t get MSU here by himself. No player has hit as many big shots for the Spartans this year as Travis Trice, who can both spot up and create his own looks off the dribble.  Even if Trice and Valentine have great games, the Spartans will need more help to upset Duke. The biggest X factor will likely be the enigmatic Branden Dawson, who made the biggest bucket of the game against Louisville in the Elite Eight but also has a frustrating tendency to disappear in big moments. If the Spartans are to have any chance of pulling off an upset this weekend, Dawson will have to be a difference-maker on defense, on the glass, and on offense, where he is by far the Spartans’ most athletic interior threat.  So will it be Kentucky’s “we do everything well” approach or Wisconsin’s stretch 4–centric machine? Duke’s smooth Okafor-and-the-outside game or Michigan State’s underheralded trio? We’ll find out in a few days. Enjoy the games, everybody.",2015-04-02T13:46:29+00:00,2015 NCAA Tournament,Goldsberry

98,James Harden’s Holy Mountain: How the Rocket Man Creates 3-Pointers,"Look, I didn’t set out to join the Church of Harden, but here I am paging through the hymnal in the front pew again. And to be honest, I feel right at home. My latest obsession is the Book of Assists, Chapter 3. By a wide margin, James Harden leads the league in assists that lead to 3s. The character of his 3 assists ranges from ho-hum to mind-bending. As I wrote a few months ago, Harden is the perfect player for the Rockets, whose obsession with 3s is well-documented. He is the perfect person to run their offense, and that compatibility is best illustrated with a few recent 3-point assists he made to Trevor Ariza. At first glance, these plays look pretty pedestrian. But upon further inspection, you can see the Holy Mountain, the angel with four faces, the unknown rider, the wheel of life, the Rock of Gibraltar, and the origin of man. Or maybe that’s just me, but bear with me here. Let’s start with an example from a Bulls-Rockets game. It starts simple enough, with Harden dribbling into a blasé Josh Smith ball screen.  As soon as Smith picks Jimmy Butler, the insanity starts. Harden nonchalantly tosses a looping no-look pass across the width of the court. The pass will land in the hands of an open 3-point shooter.  Here’s the crazy thing. As the flight path of Harden’s pass begins to crystallize, the play’s key weakside actions have barely even begun. This is akin to a quarterback receiving the snap and immediately lobbing the ball downfield. It’s an exercise in faith and a proud demonstration of tactical confidence. The soothsaying bearded man knows what’s going to happen before you do. He’s NBA Nostradamus.  Just as Harden’s pass crosses the middle of the court, Donatas Motiejunas (D-MO) sets a flare screen that takes Ariza’s defender, Kirk Hinrich, out of the play. The ball descends softly into Ariza’s hands, and the rest is history. It’s breathtaking in real time.  Look one more time at the shape of the weak side the moment Harden releases this pass. If you look closely, a piece of tumbleweed blows on by — nothing’s stirring. By the time that pass gets to Ariza, he is so wide open that he has enough time to take a short dribble, perfect his shooting stance, and rise up for an uncontested 3, which unsurprisingly finds the bottom of the net. Lest you think this was not the plan, here’s another example from December 13 against Denver:  This no-look, blind-faith, angle-flare masterpiece is my new favorite play in the NBA. It’s brilliant on many levels, but the key is that it perfectly exploits the outrageous amounts of defensive attention that opponents are giving Harden. These plays represent a maturity both in Harden’s game and the Rockets offense. As Harden the scorer has become increasingly unguardable, defenses have naturally reacted by throwing more and more resources at him. Harden and the Rockets are countering by turning this imbalanced defensive attention into open 3s for his teammates on the weak side. His willful cooperation in this exchange has elevated the overall functionality of the entire Rockets offense. Here’s one more example from a recent game against Detroit.  I’m no body language expert, but Reggie Jackson, standing at the nail here, has assumed the heightened-awareness pose of an on-ball perimeter defender even though he’s 14 feet away from the ball, supposedly defending Patrick Beverley. In a related story, he’s about to get burned.  Harden is obviously in the midst of an MVP-caliber season. Since arriving in Houston, he’s exhibited huge growth as a player, but I think it’s fair to say that, along with his defensive strides, his ability to create shots for his teammates is among the most important additions to his game. Suddenly he’s doing things — both aesthetically and statistically — that nobody else in the league is doing, or even capable of doing. You don’t have to love it, but the closer you look, the harder it is to resist the immaculate divinity of our bearded prophet.",2015-03-13T12:26:20+00:00,NBA,Goldsberry
99,Monster of the Midrange: Don’t Sleep on Chris Paul’s Deadly Elbow Jumper,"It’s February 19 at Staples Center. With the Clippers in possession and clinging to a late-game one-point lead against the Spurs, Los Angeles needs to both kill time and produce points. Fortunately, it has Chris Paul. As the game clock dips below 20 seconds, the point guard calmly dribbles out near half court. Then, with the shot clock getting closer to zero, Paul dribbles toward his happy spot, the right elbow. Everyone in the gym — including his defender, Manu Ginobili — knows he’s going to shoot.  As Paul arrives at the elbow, Ginobili can’t be any tighter, but that’s a problem. Paul nudges the Argentine away with his left forearm and slips the ball behind his back with his right hand. And just like that he has all the space he needs to knock down one of the most reliable 16-foot jumpers in the league and ice the game. No assistance necessary.  Paul isn’t just good at creating his own midrange buckets; he’s the best at it. To fully appreciate Chris Paul in 2015, you have to consider not only his Hall of Fame–worthy playmaking skills and defense, but the greatness of his less-heralded jump shot. It’s time to herald this shit, you guys.  It’s been a decade since the league legislated handchecking out of existence, and now guys like Kyrie Irving, Russell Westbrook, and Stephen Curry effortlessly blend driving, scoring, and playmaking in ways that would’ve been impossible in the Jordan era. But with all due respect to those ascendant young bucks reinventing the position, in March 2015 it’s still easy to argue that Paul is the best point guard on the planet. The job description of the contemporary superstar NBA point guard is clear: • Must be willing and able to create shots for others.
• Must be willing and able to create and make shots for himself.
• Must be willing and able to play effective defense. Again, Paul is one of the best shot creators in the business. While that’s easily represented by his currently leading the league in assists, let’s take a deeper look at what those assists are actually leading to. So far this season, 27 NBA players have scored at least 1,000 points, led by James Harden with 1,681. However, only five players have created more than 1,000 points via the assist: 1. John Wall, 1,4411
2. Chris Paul, 1,440
3. Ty Lawson, 1,358
4. James Harden, 1,081
5. Stephen Curry, 1,072  What’s more, when you consider combined points from field goals and assists, no player has been involved with more points than Paul — and much of that comes back to his lovable midrange jumper. Paul has mastered the midrange jump shot. If you think that’s an overstatement, check this out: So far this season, 53 players have attempted at least 250 midrange shots. Of that group, Paul (51 percent) is the only one who’s converting at least half of those attempts. The next closest point guards make only 45 percent (Jarrett Jack and Mo Williams), and they haven’t attempted nearly as many midrange shots as Paul has.  While this midrange production might seem anathema to current NBA trends, it’s the opposite: In a league that’s become enamored of the pick-and-roll, a point guard who can come off a screen and knock down a 17-foot jump shot keeps defenses honest. And nobody is better at it than Paul.  He is lights out anywhere around the free throw line, but as Ginobili found out last month, he’s especially outrageous from that right elbow.  Top Five Shooters From This Area, 2014-15, Minimum 100 Attempts: 1. Chris Paul, 53 percent
2. Jarrett Jack, 49 percent
3. Anthony Davis, 49 percent
4. Pau Gasol, 49 percent
5. Gordon Hayward, 47 percent  In addition to being the most accurate volume shooter in the league from the right elbow, he also leads the NBA in made shots from this zone. In other words, he blends volume and efficiency in ways nobody else can touch.  Oh, and he’s nearly as good from the other side.  Top Five Shooters From This Area, 2014-15, Minimum 100 Attempts: 1. David West, 55 percent
2. Chris Paul, 51 percent
3. Nikola Vucevic, 51 percent
4. Al Horford, 48 percent
5. Pau Gasol, 48 percent Everyone else on this list is a catch-and-shoot guy because, generally speaking, it’s easier to convert jumpers with your feet set than it is off the dribble. Paul’s putting up the same numbers with the added burden of creating his own shot. When you compare Paul’s volume and efficiency numbers strictly against his peer group of shot-creating guards, he stands out even more. Most Unassisted Midrange Field Goals (Midrange FG%): 1. Chris Paul, 232 (51 percent)
2. Monta Ellis, 153 (42 percent)
3. John Wall, 140 (40 percent)
4. Russell Westbrook, 135 (39 percent)
5. Jarrett Jack, 130 (45 percent) No matter how you slice it, Paul is having a phenomenal year. He’s getting assists like Magic, draining midrange jumpers like Dirk, getting steals like Gary Payton, and he’s not even mentioned in most MVP conversations. Among the pantheon of contemporary NBA superstars, the one tie that binds much of the league’s brightest talents together is an uncommon blend of size, athleticism, and basketball talent. LeBron is built like a tight end but can pass and handle like a much smaller player. Russell Westbrook looks like a running back but can jump out of the gym. Anthony Davis, well, he’s just a monster with a wet jumper. And then there’s Chris Paul, who’s equally as good, despite being shaped and sized like a relatively normal person. Nobody blends playmaking, scoring, and defense as effectively as he does, and nowhere on the court is that work more evident than around the elbows. Paul won’t win the MVP this season, but that’s fine. He’s still the MVPG.",2015-03-11T14:51:36+00:00,NBA,Goldsberry
100,35 Crazy Predictions for the 2015-16 NBA Season,"It’s time for an annual tradition: a bunch of random predictions about the upcoming NBA season. For this to be fun, we have to find the sweet spot between bat-crap crazy and probable. Let’s all be wrong together! There are six things to worry about with the Rockets: 1. They don’t have much good outside shooting, though Ty Lawson should generate some clean spot-up looks for James Harden. 2. It’s impossible to hide both Lawson and Harden on defense. 3. Harden spent time dating a Kardashian, Lawson is dealing with an alcohol problem, and Dwight Howard is Dwight Howard. Do you trust the personalities on this team in gut-check moments? 4. Howard’s farts could incapacitate the entire locker room before a big playoff game. 5. Several key players, including Howard and Donatas Motiejunas, are dealing with injury. If Motiejunas or Terrence Jones is ever out long term, Houston will either have to play more small ball or slot a rookie in at backup power forward. 6. Their defense, ranked sixth in points allowed per possession last season, may regress a hair — even if Howard plays more games. Opponents shot just 32 percent from deep against Houston last season, the lowest such mark in the league. The Rockets had a lot to do with all of those bricks, but that number will creep up. 2015-16 NBA PreviewEverything you need to know about the coming season.But you know what? I love this team. They are freaking loaded with relentless athletes who will never stop running, flying to the rim, launching 3s, and whipping the ball up the court in transition. They are exhausting to play against. They got Lawson for free! K.J. McDaniels may be ready for more time on the wing, Clint Capela is a player, and Harden is going to make a run at MVP again. And for all the anxiety about the shaky makeup, these guys held together during the same tense moments in which the Clippers quaked. Howard was great in the playoffs, and he has already led a team to the Finals. Why do we act as if he has accomplished nothing on the big stage? This team should scare everyone, especially because Daryl Morey has one more trade to make. Count that as an extra prediction: Houston will make one win-now move.1 The firings of Lionel Hollins and George Karl after the 2012-13 season signaled that activist owners would be more aggressive dumping successful coaches. Those moves made the Warriors, Bulls, and Thunder more comfortable batting away Mark Jackson, Tom Thibodeau, and Scott Brooks, respectively, and I’d expect the trend to continue with teams that don’t make at least a mini-leap. As Ken Berger reported earlier this week, Dwane Casey could be in trouble if the Raptors stumble early. Casey has done good work, but Toronto embarrassed itself in the playoffs last season, and the team gutted Casey’s staff of assistants for the second time in only a few seasons. They brought in Andy Greer, a Thibodeau staffer in Chicago, to revamp the defense, and before landing Greer, they made a hard run at another defensive guru, per league sources: Darren Erman, Jackson’s former assistant in Golden State, and now the associate head coach in New Orleans. Robert Sarver cops to his impatience, and the Suns weirdly refused to extend Jeff Hornacek’s contract after two seasons holding their own within the Western Conference bloodbath — including the 2013-14 campaign, when Hornacek won 48 games with a team engineered to tank. You’ll hear rumblings about David Blatt and Karl, but the bet here is that both are safe barring catastrophe; the best intel at the moment is that Sacramento’s minority owners refuse to be on the hook for yet another fired coach. Steve Clifford is in the final year of his contract with a team hell-bent on making the playoffs. Terry Stotts and Neil Olshey haven’t always seen eye to eye in Portland, and the Blazers are entering rebuild mode in the last guaranteed year of Stotts’s deal. Randy Wittman is a wild card, especially with Kevin Durant’s free agency looming. Crazy as it sounds, it wouldn’t shock me if we start hearing speculation about Dave Joerger if the Grizzlies dip toward the bottom half of the conference standings. J Pat Carter/Getty Images It makes too much financial sense, even for a player who makes bank on marketing deals. Durant could reenter free agency in the summer of 2017, when the cap will likely jump from about $90 million to $108 million — lifting max-level contracts up with it. Durant by then will have completed 10 seasons, the magic point at which a player’s max contract can soak up 35 percent of the cap — up from 30 percent for players in the prior experience tier. Add it up, and Durant stands to make something like $35 million to $40 million more going this route, instead of signing a long-term contract at the first chance this summer. He could sign with another team and still get almost this much cash, but because of Bird rights and other cap minutiae, it’s mechanically easier to re-sign with the Thunder. That would also align Durant’s real free agency with those of Russell Westbrook and Serge Ibaka, giving the trio another chance to win the ring together before deciding on their futures. This could all be moot if Durant suffers another foot injury, but the risk of this strategy is overblown for a player of Durant’s stature. He could tear his ACL and still draw multiple max offers. He could also sign a LeBron-style one-plus-one deal, with a player option for 2018-19, to add a bit of security. Cleveland is the East’s best team by a mile, but it is banged up across the roster and smart enough to take it easy during the regular season. Chicago has its own injury issues, of course. Derrick Rose broke his face in the preseason, and Mike Dunleavy Jr., an underrated glue guy, is out another couple of months. But this is a deep, versatile team with an innovative coach confident enough in his job status to make politically difficult adjustments — like perhaps bringing Joakim Noah off the bench. That might flip-flop several times, especially if Noah is as healthy and mobile as the experts at P3, the cutting-edge Santa Barbara, California, facility where Noah trained over the summer, tell me he is. Regardless: Fred Hoiberg’s (likely) move to start Nikola Mirotic is a sign that Chicago should be a more dynamic offensive team. And these guys can execute Thibodeau’s old scheme in their sleep. (Yes, I’m ignoring that their defense has stunk in the preseason. Can’t hear you!) Chicago has enough depth to withstand injury and conserve everyone’s energy. It is not going to dump Taj Gibson, a quality two-way player, just to free up minutes for Bobby Portis and clear a jammed frontcourt. Almost everyone will get to play over the long season. Rose may never be Rose again, but there’s still an effective drive-and-kick force here, especially if Hoiberg loosens the spacing. I like this team. All the projections say this is crazy, and if Skinny Kyle Lowry lights it up all season, this prediction will go down in flames. But something doesn’t smell right. This team feels rickety. Maybe it’s the continued rumblings about Casey’s job status and his relationship with Lowry — still a prickly sort. It could be the absence of Amir Johnson, who filled every gap and propped up an otherwise awful defense last season. The Drakes have remodeled that defense, but they allowed 106.6 points per 100 possessions last season, equivalent to a bottom-five mark, when Patrick Patterson and Jonas Valanciunas shared the floor. Maybe it’s DeMar DeRozan’s looming free agency, or that Masai Ujiri hasn’t put his imprint on the team beyond the DeMarre Carroll and Cory Joseph signings. If they hover around .500 too long, something might crack. In that scenario, almost no Toronto trade would surprise me. I’m smelling a small and temporary step back for one of the league’s most exciting franchises. Michael Carter-Williams got too much blame for Milwaukee’s mini-collapse after the stunning deadline swap of Brandon Knight; Milwaukee outscored opponents by 6.4 points per 100 possessions with Carter-Williams on the floor during the regular season, per NBA.com. A lot of the late-season falloff, especially on offense, resulted from injuries and other issues with a peppy veteran bench. But the team’s offense cratered during the playoffs, and there may not be enough shooting when Carter-Williams and Giannis Antetokounmpo share the floor with a traditional big man — Greg Monroe or John Henson. Jabari Parker should provide some airspace as a stretch power forward, but he’s played 25 NBA games and is coming back from an ACL tear. We should expect him to struggle for a bit, especially on defense, where he looked out of sorts — like most rookies. Zaza Pachulia and Jared Dudley were key ball-movers, and the Bucks dumped them for zilch. Greivis Vasquez represents a key late-game option, beside Carter-Williams or in his place, and you know Jason Kidd will get funky with small-ball lineups. Monroe’s post game is a fail-safe, provided the Bucks can enter him the ball. If scoring is a grind, the Bucks won’t be able to afford much slippage on defense after finishing a shocking no. 2 in points allowed per possession. Monroe isn’t as bad on that end as his reputation, and the Bucks got by last season without a rim-protecting center in the starting lineup. But Monroe is not quite as heady as Pachulia, and Milwaukee’s helter-skelter system isn’t catching anyone by surprise. That scheme surrendered a ton of 3s last season, including a league-high 7.9 corner 3s per game, and things could spin in the wrong direction if opponents shoot a little better. Plus, this team is just so damn young. Getty Images These guys get Milwaukee’s spot, Miami replaces Brooklyn, and, bam, there’s your eight-team field. The Pacers are short one quality big for those nights when they want to beef up, and it wouldn’t surprise me if they cobbled together a trade package for a marginal upgrade over Jordan Hill and Lavoy Allen. They could do better than marginal if they attached a lottery-protected first-rounder to Chase Budinger’s salary (and maybe Solomon Hill), but Larry Bird likes Budinger, and the Pacers probably aren’t good enough to justify that sort of win-now move. There has been too much fretting about Paul George moving to power forward. Also, George is freaking awesome — a borderline top-10 player if he’s at peak health. On a lot of nights, the Pacers will have the best player on the floor. That’s a nice place to start. Look up and down the East: There aren’t a lot of teams with two big men so good and so burly that they make you queasy about having George defend them. Hell, C.J. Miles and Budinger can take some of them so George can hound stud wing scorers. George can dust opposing bigs, and if teams hide their extra big on Miles, expect Indy to run him around picks until that big is hopelessly behind. George and Monta Ellis will have acres of space to drive-and-kick, George Hill makes it easy to hide Ellis on defense, and Hill played at an All-Star level last season. Frank Vogel is a really good coach. I’d be more confident in this pick if the Pacers had a single above-average roll man to suck in defenders; they are asking too much of Ian Mahinmi on offense, especially since he’s a clueless passer. But this should work well enough for Indy to snag the no. 8 spot. Speaking of roll men! Evans is a pogo stick who showed flashes of a usable midranger two seasons ago in Utah, but he was never good enough at any one skill to stay on the court. Dallas needs all the help it can get, and Rick Carlisle has been using Evans at three positions in the preseason. He has looked explosive rolling and dunking amid clear space like a miniature (and much worse) Tyson Chandler, and he’s jacking 3s. He’s 2-of-13, and he hasn’t proved he can guard either forward position. But Evans can do some things, and he should get a chance. Fine, I’m a year ahead on this prediction, but given that the first enormous cap jump will coincide with a blah free-agency class, I’m betting that more teams next season will just punt on reaching the minimum salary floor. The counterargument is simple: Any asset is better than nothing. Even if you can only get a measly second-rounder for absorbing someone else’s unwanted contract, lifting your own team above the floor in the process, you might as well do it. But the penalty for coming in below the floor is almost painless: You split the difference among your own players. You can buy some goodwill that way. This could be our chance to vanquish the silly notion that the MVP has to go to someone from one of the league’s top two or three teams. The Pelicans can barely field an NBA rotation right now, and Davis, Mr. Limitless, is going to put up monster numbers while keeping them afloat until the cavalry arrives. If Davis emerges as the league’s best two-way player and carries a battered New Orleans team to the no. 6 seed, he should have a chance at history. Calling Davis for Defensive Player of the Year is premature, but I can’t find a safer choice. Rudy Gobert will get a lot of preseason votes, and he was the league’s best rim protector last season. But his résumé is limited and teams are ready for him now. Ibaka never made the mini-leap required for him to win this award, and all the other classic big-man candidates — Marc Gasol, Howard, Noah, Roy Hibbert — have slipped. Kawhi Leonard has a real chance to repeat, and Draymond Green is a multi-positional monster. But Davis already smothers people of all sizes one-on-one, and he has the raw tools of a dominant help defender. The Pellies ranked 22nd last season, even while putting up stingy numbers when Davis and Omer Asik shared the floor. The team defense was an uncoordinated mess. Erman, the team’s lead assistant, will change that after playing a central role in Golden State’s rise from laughingstock to juggernaut. He lives and breathes defense. He might not have a single non-paper plate in his apartment. I would have called a top-10 finish if New Orleans were in the ballpark of healthy, but it’s not, and a 10-spot jump is plenty. The Sixers denied almost all of this damning SI.com story, but there is some legitimate smoke behind it. There are elements of the organization anxious to start winning soon. There are worries about Sam Hinkie’s reputation around the league. Agents whine that he doesn’t return calls and waives players without telling them first. People around Jorge Gutierrez complain that Philly promised Brooklyn it wouldn’t waive Gutierrez after demanding the Nets include him in the Andrei Kirilenko deal, only to waive him almost immediately; the Sixers deny making any such promises. Of course agents complain about Philly! The Sixers don’t use their cap space, they waive a gazillion players every season, and they are the last-chance refuge for any player on his way out of the NBA. The Sixers are confident that players will take their money when it’s time to spend. They’re probably right. But if things go worse than anticipated over the next year, expect some fissures to open. Garrett Ellwood/NBAE via Getty Images The Spurs could be special, and I’m optimistic about the LaMarcus Aldridge fit — even if some folks in rival front offices and coaching staffs remain skeptical. The other stuff worries me: Tony Parker’s decline, and that so many key contributors around the Aldridge-Leonard–Danny Green foundation are 33 and older. Tim Duncan isn’t going to play like this until he’s 45. If the Spurs stay healthy, they could round into championship form in May and June. But the interim could be rockier than expected. As for those lovable Grizz, I can’t shake the sense that time has passed them by. They’ll be good — they’re always good — but this core has won zero conference finals games, and it eked past the second round only when Westbrook’s knee injury crippled the Thunder. They just don’t have enough punch to get through three playoff series in the West. It’s hard to win 93-88 over and over; you need the kind of variance that gets you a few easy ones. The Grizz have never had that, and they still don’t. And they’re just getting older. And then you remember: This team shook Golden State. They had Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson pump-faking at phantoms, to the point that Draymond Green demanded Curry come out with him for a drink after Game 3 of the conference finals. They could win any single series, but can they win three? Four? Even if they conclude by February that they aren’t a contender, the Grizzlies may not have a big move to make. The obvious play would be trading Zach Randolph, the oldest of their three stars, and working on a killer contract. But as long as Gasol and Mike Conley are here, Memphis is a win-now team, and it’s hard to find a Randolph trade that brings enough win-now return. The Grizz can just keep him and dangle max-level cap space at a wing player — Harrison Barnes? Chandler Parsons? Two or three so-so guys? — before re-signing Conley. He just fits, wherever he goes. The Scott Skiles bump is real, but with so many teams trying to win, it’s hard to see Orlando making the kind of mega-leap on defense that people are expecting. For purposes of this prediction, we’re counting on-court/off-court plus-minus splits for two-man combinations among Johnson, Olynyk, Tyler Zeller, David Lee, and Jared Sullinger.2 The Zeller-Lee combo seems to be Brad Stevens’s preferred starting lineup choice, but Johnson is going to play a ton — I bet he starts at some point during the season — and his game meshes well with Olynyk’s on both ends. I’m worried about the Mavs and poor Dirk. They could be set up for a fascinating internal debate between Mark Cuban, a shark who knows when to strike, and Rick Carlisle, a coach who once lambasted the Warriors in a competition committee meeting for their late-season tankery in 2012, per league sources. Parsons and Wesley Matthews will play at some point, probably soon, but it may take them months to start humming after major offseason surgeries. It’s unclear how the Mavs will defend the basket with Samuel Dalembert, always late and out of shape, as their only rim protector. A full-on Deron Williams resurrection seems like a lot to ask after years of leg and ankle issues. The Mavs owe a top-seven-protected first-rounder to Boston, and if things go badly enough early, you could see them spiraling toward one of the league’s seven worst records. Shut down the recovering wings, clean up one of Dirk’s joints, and stink all spring. But list the league’s worst teams and you’ll discover it’d be pretty hard for the Mavs to finish in the bottom seven unless they tank early. And they’re not going to do that. [Cut to Danny Ainge rubbing his hands together.] The Hawks’ win total is going to plummet from the 60 they put up last season, and the naysayers will crow about how it was all a fluke. But a team can win fewer games and still be qualitatively about the same, and I’m betting on the Hawks to do that — provided they stay healthy. Tiago Splitter fills a need on defense, and his mad rolls to the rim should mesh with Al Horford and Paul Millsap. Dennis Schroder and Mike Muscala are a year older, and more Muscala gives Mike Budenholzer flexibility to bench the feast-or-famine Mike Scott. They’ll miss Carroll, but Atlanta’s player development staff is as good as it gets. They’ll get something out of Thabo Sefolosha, Tim Hardaway Jr., and Kent Bazemore. Nathaniel S. Butler/NBAE via Getty Images Neither New York team is going to be good, but if you surround Carmelo Anthony with at least a few competent NBA players, you should be able to push 30 wins in the East. The Nets roster beyond Brook Lopez, Thad Young, and Joe Johnson is a train wreck, and the Young-Lopez front line isn’t stopping anyone. The Nets are one Lopez foot injury from being a sub-20-win team. People realize the Celtics could win 48 games and get the first pick in the draft via the Nets, right? Holy hell. The Knicks are just as vulnerable to a Melo knee injury, but he doesn’t have one recurring problem like Lopez’s foot stuff, and when both players are healthy, Melo is just a more galvanizing force. It’s a common refrain: The Nets will try to win as many games as possible to avoid the humiliation of coughing up a high lottery pick to Boston. But that shouldn’t be the case unless the Nets are on the bubble for the no. 8 seed. The pick is gone. It’s not a top-eight-protected pick. It’s just gone. Once you’re in the lottery, it doesn’t matter if that pick is no. 8 or no. 5 or no. 1. Losing the no. 1 pick is an embarrassment that stains your franchise forever, but the pick belongs to someone else regardless. In other words: If the Nets stink and they can get a future first-round pick for Young, they should do it — even it costs them wins. Getting that kind of return for Young will be tough, with teams again valuing first-round picks like gold, and the Nets may be the kind of team that is more concerned with optics than sound management. They might be able to get more than one first-round pick for Lopez if he keeps rolling, but they need Lopez to lure free agents this summer, when they could have enough cap space for two max contracts. They’re determined to preserve that space, so they won’t flip Johnson’s massive expiring contract for two or three rotation players on longer deals — the sort of panicked win-now move that has been their M.O. the last four years. The Nets won’t clog their cap sheet, and those kinds of deals are much harder to find today anyway. Contracts are shorter, and the league is swimming in future cap room. There just aren’t many good players on multiyear deals that teams are itching to dump. Rival execs are crossing their fingers that the Nets buy out Johnson’s contract to let him chase a ring, and there’s a small chance they do that. But they’re under the tax already, so they don’t need to. The Thunder have five choices for their starting 2-guard: • Andre Roberson, the current starter. He can’t shoot, and no one guards him. The whole league saw what Golden State did to Tony Allen in the playoffs. That kind of strategy won’t work as well against the Thunder; they don’t have two post-up brutes clogging the lane, and their stars can get buckets in any atmosphere. But having one guy whom opponents abandon is suboptimal, and every inch matters against elite teams. It’s unclear if Roberson is playable when the chips are down. • Dion Waiters. He has played decently in the preseason, but no one has any real faith this will carry over. • Anthony Morrow. He’s a killer shooter, but coaches don’t trust him. • Kyle Singler. He crapped the bed in Oklahoma City and would be at a fatal speed disadvantage in a lot of matchups. • Russell Westbrook. The Thunder could play huge minutes with D.J. Augustin (or Cameron Payne) alongside Westbrook. That’s an out-of-the-box thing they haven’t done much with the roster at full strength. The Thunder feel ripe for a trade, but they’ve already dealt away two first-rounders; they can’t trade another one. They might be able to snag someone like Randy Foye for Singler and a future second-rounder, and Foye would be a nice fit. He hits open 3s, works a nice secondary pick-and-roll, and tries on defense. He’s a welcome presence in any locker room. If the Thunder want to do better than a Foye type, it will require attaching Payne or Mitch McGary to Steve Novak’s expiring deal. That seems unlikely. In the past, Denver has asked a ton for Wilson Chandler — two firsts, or one quality young player and a first, per league sources — but it feels inevitable that it’ll come down on that price once it falls hopelessly out of the playoff race. On the flip side, the contract extensions for Chandler and Danilo Gallinari increased their trade value; teams have more cap space than they can spend, and they’d be happy to fill some of it with one of those guys. The most likely outcome is that no deal happens, but that’s boring. Chandler feels gettable, so I’ll go out on that limb. The Kenneth Faried rumblings, which popped up two years ago, have never really stopped. The two sides are talking privately and saying optimistic things publicly. We won’t have a new deal by the end of June, but the mood will be positive. Come and join me on Lockout Optimist Island! Also: Look for the union to mount a push against the league’s anti-flopping rules. My best guesses on the key extension candidates, given the latest intel: • Harrison Barnes: no, but I’d say there’s a 25 percent chance the two sides find a last-second compromise. • Dion Waiters: no. • Tyler Zeller: a 30 percent chance, maybe a bit lower. • Jared Sullinger: no. • Terrence Ross: yes; it’s something like 50-50 as of now, sources say, and determined negotiators can take 50-50 situations over the goal line. • Evan Fournier: leaning “yes.” • Meyers Leonard: no. Buyers, including some familiar names from past bids, are sniffing around, confident they can find an owner ready to sell. Minnesota is always the best bet, and league insiders are wondering when Michael Jordan might decide to cut bait in Charlotte. There are no indications he’s ready to do that — REPEAT: NO INDICATIONS — but these things can turn in unpredictable ways, and fast. An annual tradition in this space, and the easiest prediction on the board. Maddie Meyer/Getty Images Danny Ainge loves both of these guys, league sources say, but Sullinger is last in a long line of big men — and he’s a David Falk client due a new contract after this season. Sullinger alone may not fetch much on the open market; he’s a defensive liability with conditioning issues and a 3-pointer that never quite materialized. There are teams that could use another big man, but it’s hard to see Boston getting a quality asset for Sullinger. Add Young, and you might get something. Young is just 20, so it’s understandable that he’s behind so many guards on this 15-deep roster. But it’s unclear if he’ll play in Year 2, and after that, teams already have to start thinking about contract extensions. The Celtics could have 13 players back next season, plus three first-round picks — taking them one player over the 15-man limit. They have to do something at some point. They could stand pat, of course. Ainge is saving his best ammo for a star. But it’s hard to find the next youngish star, beyond DeMarcus Cousins (and maybe Kevin Love), that could hit the trade market in the next 18 months. With that in mind, here’s a random bonus prediction: Some team will make a big trade offer for a young sub-star who just signed a new contract or a player about to become a restricted free agent. Tobias Harris comes to mind as a candidate for this kind of deal. (Channing Frye is also available, by the way.) A team in Orlando’s position has no real reason to deal Harris; with the cap rising, almost every contract is somewhere between good and acceptable. But that same logic could motivate a suitor to overpay for a good but flawed young or midcareer player — especially if that suitor concludes that no superstar is likely to become available soon. The league is so poor on wings who can shoot 3s and adequately defend both shooting guards and small forwards that I could see a team like New Orleans talking itself into Nick Young — even with Young’s deal running three more seasons.3 Young is a punch line, but his $5.3 million–per-year deal will look teensy as the cap leaps, and he still shot 37 percent from deep in an embarrassing season with the Lakers. He’s serviceable on defense when he cares. He might be able to play a role on a good team that can reach him. As for the Suns, they are liable to do anything. Phoenix and Philly almost double-handedly saved a trade deadline that looked like another snoozer with 24 hours to go. P.J. Tucker is starting to feel a little extraneous, even though he gives the Suns a bulldog defensive mentality on the wing and can slide to power forward in small lineups. That skill doesn’t feel quite as essential with Mirza Teletovic and T.J. Warren around, and Warren is ready for bigger minutes at Tucker’s regular position. Archie Goodwin should play more, too, and Sonny Weems is here. Phoenix has extra draft picks galore. Ryan McDonough is hoarding them for a bigger move, but the Suns might be able to get something meaningful by combining Tucker, one pick, and another player. I picked Cleveland last season, ending a three-year run of getting this prediction right. Stupid LeBattical. A Thunder team with healthy stars, better coaching, and Enes Kanter pummeling people off the bench should light up the league. The franchise’s minority owners have been having pointed conversations over the last few months about Vivek Ranadivé’s stewardship, per league sources, but they are powerless to do anything under the franchise’s governing documents — unless Ranadivé accepts an offer to sell his controlling stake. If the Kings continue to be unstable, look for some of this noise to become public. All hail the repeater tax! They’re changing their scheme in a way that should work, Blake Griffin and DeAndre Jordan are in their primes, and the Clips have a ton of roster continuity. This should be the best defensive team of the Chris Paul–Griffin–Jordan era. Thus ending a depressing six-year streak of finishing 16th or worse in both offensive and defensive efficiency. Do you know how hard that is? This may be the year the league has to face this question: Do we care enough about tampering to enforce the rules, or do we just gut them? Fire away, big guys!",2015-10-23T11:19:10+00:00,2015 NBA Preview,Lowe
101,Confessions of a Former Diehard,"I remember the exact moment my Mets fandom crested: September 16, 1998, when Todd Hundley cranked a pinch-hit solo homer to put the Mets up 4-3 in the 11th inning in Houston. Turk Wendell, that rosin-tossing freak show with the lethal slider, blanked the Astros in the bottom half to clinch the win. The Mets were 86-68, just a half-game behind Chicago in the wild-card race. I sprinted upstairs, busted into my parents’ bedroom without knocking — what in the world was I thinking? — and announced, breathlessly, that the Mets had won on a Hundley homer. I had been watching the game 45 minutes earlier with my dad when Mike Piazza, the long-lost superstar New York had acquired in the middle of that season, came up with two on and two out in the ninth and the Mets trailing 2-0. I was shaking on the couch. I felt the home run coming in my bones. I told my dad. He laughed at me. Piazza smashed a laser-beam line drive over the right-field wall to put New York up 3-2. Hundley winning the game two innings later was poetic. He was the incumbent All-Star catcher; Piazza had displaced him. I owned an official Hundley jersey. He was the team’s best player as the Mets crept up from mediocrity starting in 1997. I had already bought a Piazza batting practice jersey, but I wouldn’t spring for the real thing, because in my head, that would have been disrespectful to Hundley’s tenured status. The Mets had tried to play Hundley in the outfield, but it wasn’t working. I couldn’t say it out loud, but I knew on that night that Hundley was done as a Met — that the game-winning homer might be his last great moment in New York. I loved Hundley. The Lowes were a baseball (and basketball) family. My parents would get why I had to wake them up and tell them what Hundley had done. They were still awake, and demanded the details. The Mets won games that were more important, and did so in more thrilling fashion, the next year, when they advanced to the National League Championship Series, and then in 2000, when they lost to the hateful Yankees in the Subway Series. But every fan gets amped for playoff games. The pure joy I felt over a regular-season game, a joy that still courses through my body as I close my eyes and recall sprinting around the house, is something more special. It is representative of how much that team, and that particular group of players, meant to me. And it’s all gone, and has been for years. The Mets are doing the very thing I lived 25 years hoping they’d do, and it is absolutely killing me inside. Never let your passions die. ??? Sporting News via Getty Images Todd Hundley at the plate in 1998. I became a Mets fan by accident. My father grew up in New Hampshire, a die-hard Red Sox and Celtics fan, and he passed most of those loyalties down to me. When I was 4 or 5, I told him I wanted to be a Sox fan, too. He patted me on the head and suggested that perhaps I should pick another team. He didn’t say why, but I imagine he felt he was sparing me a lifetime of anguish. He proposed a National League team: the Mets, the local team, or maybe the Pirates, since my mom grew up in Pittsburgh. Anyone but the Yankees. My father is a good father. I picked the Mets sometime around 1983. I didn’t know they were about to become good, and then historically good, that they would vanquish my dad’s team in perhaps the most gutting World Series ever, and that I would spend so many tortured years outnumbered amid a sea of chest-thumping Yankees fan braggarts. Being in the minority while growing up in Connecticut drew all my Mets fan friends closer to each other and made us love the team more. It gave us a little community. We read everything we could find, watched as many games as we could, and talked giddily about how Paul Wilson, Bill Pulsipher, and Jason Isringhausen represented the resurrection. The young guns never really panned out, but the Mets got good in the mid- and late 1990s anyway, just as I went to college and lost TV access to them. When I was in my dorm room during games, I sat at my desk, hitting “refresh” on my Netscape window to get pitch-by-pitch updates. My roommate, a crazed Padres fan, did the same thing 10 feet away. I wrote wild-card standings on my little whiteboard during Septembers when the Mets were in contention, and updated them every day. I dated a Yankees fan and nearly broke up with her on an almost monthly basis, because I did not understand how any good-hearted human could like that team. It was when I was home from college during the summers of 1996, 1997, and 1998 — peaking with that Astros game — that the Mets began to mean something even deeper to me. Like a lot of college kids, I lost touch with most of my high school friends. I saw them now and then when we were all home, but those get-togethers petered out as we got older. I was home most nights after working my day job as a lifeguard and water polo coach, and I’d set up shop after dinner in the downstairs TV room — alone. The games were too serious to watch with my parents, and I needed access to a computer so I could email my college buddies. I could have been lonely in those summers, but the Mets became my refuge. I experienced that weird sensation where you get to know the players’ habits so well that you almost feel like you understand them as people. I could visualize how Rey Ordonez talked into his glove at shortstop and used that popup slide on balls hit to his right; how Edgardo Alfonzo turned double plays and hit to the opposite field; how John Olerud palmed his helmet between swings; the casual little underhand half-swings Piazza used before snapping into his stance; Al Leiter taking off his hat and wiping sweat off his forehead between pitches of yet another at-bat stuck at a 3-2 count; the necklace of teeth that Wendell wore around his neck; how Armando Benitez1 would constantly miss up and away to lefties; how Dennis Cook fell off the mound after every pitch. I talked to them through the television screen. There were small dents in the wall from the times I’d thrown the remote after John Franco had blown saves. I spent more time with those Mets during those three summers than I did with human beings I actually knew. If I’d worked the late shift, I would sometimes just drive around, listening to Bob Murphy’s drawl on WFAN. I’m afraid to think about what I would have given up then to see them win it all. They fell short in 1999 and 2000, but they at least avoided the suddenly plausible Mets–Red Sox World Series — and the family awkwardness it would have caused. Those years gave me the elation I had dreamed about and exposed me to the pain, sadness, and anger that comes when your team gets so close. I got all that raw and unfiltered. I knew there was no way I could cheer against my dad finally getting to see Boston end the curse. The Mets sank back into mediocrity after 2000, and the Sox got better and better. By 2003, the Aaron Boone year, I was shouting for Boston at New York City bars and calling my dad during games. In 2004, I rearranged my work schedule at a newspaper to watch ALCS and World Series games with him. We cried when Boston won. I couldn’t quite go back from that — back to being a die-hard Mets fan as if I had never gotten emotionally invested in another team. It didn’t feel right to have two “favorite” teams. I was lost. There was probably a window when I could have reverted, but I got more serious about my career, immersed myself in New York, met a woman whom I would marry, and devoted every second of my spare time to basketball. You become an adult, and you naturally slough things off. It’s too easy. I hate to admit it, but the Mets being bad made it easier. Ignore a team for one or two years and suddenly you don’t know a single name on the roster. Here’s my warning: Do not do that. Do not let go completely. Watch one game every two weeks, check a box score, attend two games a year. Just stay a little bit engaged, so when fortunes turn, you’re still part of it. I am not part of it right now, as the Mets do this insane thing they are doing. I live in Queens and ride the subway into Manhattan for meetings all the time, and people everywhere are wearing Mets stuff. I should be wearing Mets stuff, too — maybe the “I Cheer for Two Teams: The Mets and Whoever Plays the Yankees” shirt I’ve had for 30 years — and high-fiving those people. I had to take a road trip on Monday, and I listened to Mike Francesa talk about how he had never seen a pitching staff like this young Mets staff. Never! He’s seen the Koufax-Drysdale Dodgers, the Jim Palmer Orioles, all those great Yankees teams, and for him, nothing compares to this group of young Mets flamethrowers. I smiled and laughed, but mostly I felt sad. I had spent years envisioning this moment — the Mets ruling the city, blitzing through the playoffs, poised for a long run of dominance. This is the exact thing for which you invest your time and heartache. This is the payoff. And I’m out. I’m so far out that I don’t feel right about coming back in. The enjoyment would feel phony. Real fans draw the deepest satisfaction from living and growing with the players: forgiving their failures, watching their growth, rejoicing in small achievements that only the diehards notice during a random game in June, and finally basking in it with them — very much with them — when it all clicks. One of my best friends from college is a Royals fan, and we made grandiose plans 15 years ago to fly back and forth for games if they ever met in the World Series. It was fanciful — dreams for a reality that would never happen. Now that moment is almost here, but the universe in which those two guys made those plans is long gone. I made a sports fan choice, and I’m living with it. Almost everyone I know over 35 has given up following at least one of their favorite teams. Life intervenes. Negotiate that choice carefully. If there is one team that means more to you than the others, hold on to some part of it. Because when they become relevant again, when they finally hit big, it freaking hurts to be on the outside. All that said, for old time’s sake: Let’s go Mets. I don’t know who you are anymore, you young pitchers with crazy hair, but if you win, it will make me smile.",2015-10-22T11:29:02+00:00,2015 MLB Playoffs,Lowe
102,"The Annual NBA League Pass Rankings, Part 1","There are a lot of methods for watching the NBA, but the best way to learn about any team — its rhythms, patterns, and habits — is to watch entire games. Going the full 48 means immersing yourself in the sights and sounds of a team’s localized League Pass culture. It’s a commitment, and some commitments are more fulfilling than others. Your time is precious, so before every new season, Grantland ranks the 30 League Pass experiences based on scores from 0 to 10 in five categories: PLAYOFFS/ZEITGEIST: An estimate of every team’s place in the day-to-day NBA conversation, and whether all of that noise correlates with watchability. We talk about the Sixers and Knicks a lot, but that doesn’t mean you should devote two and a half hours a night to them. INDIVIDUAL PLAYER APPEAL: How often Twitter explodes with a stream of, “HOLY CRAP, TURN THE CHANNEL IMMEDIATELY, PLAYER X HAS GONE INSANE!!!!!” Some 30-point games are more stylish than others. LEAGUE PASS MINUTIAE: My pet category — a measure of how a game looks and sounds, and whether you’ll be rushing for the “mute” button. HOOPS STYLE: A slow-it-down team cycling between predictable sets is less entertaining than, say, the Warriors. Coaching affects aesthetics! UNINTENTIONAL COMEDY SCALE: Bill Simmons’s pet category, back when we did these rankings together. We’re serious about hoops, but lighthearted nonsense can pull you through a Wednesday night in January: “That’s another shot-clock violation for the Lakers, as Nick Young, Kobe, and Lou Williams have torn the ball into three pieces. And here come the pretzels!” Here’s how the 2015-16 Grantland League Pass Rankings came out: Michael Kidd-Gilchrist’s injury cost Charlotte at least three spots. He is a balls-out daredevil who injects a sleepy team with a dose of unpredictability. The Hornets under Steve Clifford have been boring, and it has worked. They slow it down, pound the post, let Kemba Walker launch barfy midrangers, and sit back in perhaps the league’s most conservative defensive scheme. Boring can win, but it’s bad TV. Charlotte in the preseason has embraced fun, and if that lasts, the Hornets could make this ranking look silly. They’re bombing 3s and the trio of Cody Zeller, Frank Kaminsky, and Spencer Hawes are pinging smart passes. Zeller is good for a random thunder dunk every few games. Professor Al Jefferson pump-fakes suckers out of their shoes on the left block, but only crazed footwork fetishists are flipping channels to watch a Big Al hot streak. Jeremy Lin’s hair bumps up the comedy score, but there isn’t enough entertainment here — yet, at least — beyond the killer honeycomb court and solid broadcast work of Dell Curry, Stephanie Ready, and the rest of the crew. At least we know Charlotte will be trying all season. Jobs across the organization are in jeopardy if the Hornets miss the playoffs again. The Nuggets have fallen out of the national discourse, and they don’t even have JaVale McGee anymore to pump up their comedy score. There are things for basketball nerds here: a rejuvenated, brash Danilo Gallinari; the development of Emmanuel Mudiay under Mike Malone; high-post dishing from Nikola Jokic and Joffrey Lauvergne (those are real players, I swear); and Jusuf Nurkic bulldozing guys — and then cursing at them afterward in Serbo-Croatian. But the Nuggets lack a magnetic star, and their closest approximation — Gallo — may not get to gallop around as a small-ball power forward as much with Malone juggling six rotation bigs. Forcing viewers to watch J.J. Hickson steal rebounds and play zero defense is a minor crime against basketball. Scott Hastings, Denver’s longtime color guy, undermines his solid X’s-and-O’s work by railing at the officials, and the team’s daring new court design is a downgrade:  I’m not sure how anyone could look at the old floor and think, “You know what we need to eliminate? The powder blue!” Give me back my powder blue, Nuggets! The 5280/300 marker along the near sideline is too cute for its own good. The “300” is a reference to the 300 sunny days Denver enjoys on average every year, but no one will catch that without an explanation, and even team officials aren’t sure if the stat is accurate. The shaded pickaxes are cool, but I’m calling it now: The shaded technique — prominent now in Milwaukee, New Orleans, Denver, and Cleveland — is a slippery slope toward the garish. An unwatchable cast of vanilla slowpokes, misfits, and fringe players (and Thad Young) lifted from dead last by the only perfect “10” League Pass Minutiae score. The Nets, once again, sport the league’s best top-to-bottom broadcast experience. Ian Eagle is a god, dropping deadpan gold and fake-feuding with Mike Fratello. The czar brings hoops expertise, dry humor, and delightfully bad stick-figure telestrations of upcoming opponents Eagle deciphers in a warped NBA version of Pictionary — one of the best running gags in broadcast sports. The herringbone court with minimalist black-and-white trim — now with subway-tile-style baseline font! — is a masterpiece. Andrea Bargnani’s mere presence brings the possibility of a sad-faced, half-bearded blooper, but beyond Bargs, the team isn’t that funny. Hell, Brook Lopez doesn’t even go to Comic-Con anymore! He is shooting 3s now after beasting it over the second half of last season, but his blend of molasses-slow touch and power doesn’t draw eyeballs. Break up the Nets. Garrett Ellwood/NBAE via Getty Images A casual fan might assume the NBA contracted the Pistons sometime after the disastrous free-agency spending spree of 2009. No one talks about them. They have finished 15th or worse in both points scored and allowed per possession for six straight seasons, a twin streak no other team can touch. They’ve chewed up coaches, clogged the paint with the Josh Smith, Greg Monroe, Andre Drummond trio, and performed to empty arenas. It is desultory. The notorious SVG is spicing it up with a spread pick-and-roll system centered around Drummond and Reggie Jackson. Detroit blitzed opponents late last season when those two played without Greg Monroe, but defenses will test them now by going under picks on Jackson and fouling the hell out of Drummond. Stan Van Gundy’s vision depends in part on Jackson hitting enough jumpers to keep defenses honest. The battle for wing minutes between Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Stanley Johnson, Jodie Meeks, and Cranky Morrii no. 2 will be interesting, and Marcus Morris will see a ton of time at power forward in stretchier groups. Ersan Ilyasova looks like Frankenstein crossed with James Dean. Aron Baynes fouls innocent bystanders. Remember “FORM A FUCKING WALL“? You know Stan Van is good for at least three or four classic quips, even if he has toned down his rant game in Detroit. Brandon Jennings and Dallas’s Wes Matthews are living science experiments — rare in-their-prime guys rallying from an injury that devastates older players. Let’s hope they bust historical trends. Philly and Portland deadlocked, but under my new dictatorship, entering Year 3 of not even trying to field a competitive present-day team costs you the tiebreaker. Philly gets a “zeitgeist” bump for shifting the debate on tanking, lottery reform, and competitive ethics; every hint of progress or regression from Nerlens Noel, Jerami Grant, Robert “Bob” Covington, and Jahlil Okafor feels like a small referendum on a mathematically sound — if ugly — process. That appeal wears off by the end of November, when the Sixers are 3-17, and opponents are sitting their best players against them. The Sixers aren’t bad to watch. They work their asses off on defense, fast break whenever possible, and play a junior varsity version of Morey Ball on offense — all 3s and rim attacks, only the Philly players aren’t good enough to actually make those shots. Fitting Noel’s herky-jerky drives and developing elbow jumper around Okafor’s post-ups will be a fun day-to-day challenge. Brett Brown always looks like he’s about to run onto the court and execute the damn play himself. And who knows, by the end of the year, Joel Embiid might dunk in a layup line again! The broadcast experience is pleasing, though I will miss Malik Rose’s barely hidden distaste for the Hinkie Plan; Alaa Abdelnaby has big shoes to fill with Rose now in the Hawks front office. The court and unis look pretty, though the Sixers blew up their center logo to a ridiculous 400 square feet. Portland being so low shows how viewer-friendly the NBA is right now. The Blazers are roadkill in the West, but a Terry Stotts offense flows, and the general structure of Meyers Leonard spotting up around Damian Lillard/Mason Plumlee1 pick-and-rolls makes sense. Leonard won’t be a mystery after this season; Stotts will let him gun from deep, and he’ll get extended minutes to show he at least understands the general concept of defense. Lillard will have the green light from anywhere past midcourt, and Portland has dotted the roster with reclamation types itching to prove themselves. Even Stotts, a great coach, has a lot at stake as he enters the final year of his contract.2 Chris Kaman brings a hillbilly fear factor you rarely see in the NBA. C.J. McCollum is going to jitterbug his way to a ton of points. Gerald Henderson is one of the league’s secret vicious in-game dunkers — and he’ll be trade bait all season! Everything about the Blazers looks nice, though the local broadcast team can get a little homerific. This could be the most watchable awful team in NBA history. They’d have ranked higher, if not for a local broadcast team that makes it seem as if every single shot — and especially every Kobe chuck — is a MASSIVELY IMPORTANT PART OF AN EPIC TALE THE BARDS WILL SING FOR CENTURIES. Close your eyes, listen to Bill Macdonald narrate a random L.A. loss, and you might think Kobe was leading the Lakers into battle against the Celtics in Game 7. If Kobe throws two straight passes that indicate a basic understanding of basketball, brace yourselves for high-pitched proclamations about FACILITATOR MODE. Kobe’s fight against time, and his refusal to acknowledge what it has done to his game, is great theater. He has resisted the step down from star to role player, but the Lakers have enough ball handlers now — Jordan Clarkson, D’Angelo Russell, Lou Williams, the rising Julius Randle — that Kobe should feel comfortable dialing back his usage. But there will be games when Kobe loses patience with the kiddos, when every teammate seems as soft as Charmin, and he reaches down for the pivots, spins, and fadeaways that were once unguardable. Those shots rarely go in anymore, and they require more and more arc as Kobe’s hops expire. They stand against every trend of the post-2010 NBA. Still, they carry a potent nostalgia. Also potent is the Lakers’ unmatched collection of unintentional comedy fodder: Williams, Kobe, and Nick Young sharing one ball; Young doing literally anything; Ryan Kelly’s hair; Metta World Peace and Marcelo Huertas being here for some reason; Robert Sacre’s bench antics; the inevitable blank stare from Roy Hibbert when Kobe screams at him; fans slowly realizing Clarkson is about to become a free agent even though the team had the leverage and cap room to push for a longer deal; and Byron Scott, dead man walking. Ron Hoskins/NBAE via Getty Images I can’t wait to see if Paul George regains his unique brand of slithery explosiveness, and Indy forcibly shifting him to power forward turns every game into a chess match. George and Monta Ellis will slice through driving lanes that had been clogged before, and if opponents hide their extra big on C.J. Miles, they’ll discover that Miles can roast them flying around screens for catch-and-shoot 3s. Some opponents will downsize just to keep up. Others will stay big and bash Indy with size. Everyone will face choices. Frank Vogel might be tempted to ditch small ball when Indiana starts slow, but the whole point is to let the spacing and shooting advantage take hold over time. Vogel might have to get gimmicky on defense to spare George some pounding and match him up against elite wing scorers. Transition in both directions will be fun, with guys scrambling to find their proper assignments. Myles Turner has a chance to become a new-breed “stretch center,” though it might be too soon to expect much. The court and jerseys look great. Quinn Buckner talks over every second of action, and sometimes just makes a series of “oof” and “ahh” noises, but it’s somehow endearing. Larry Bird may leap out of the stands and murder Jordan Hill if Hill mails it in as blatantly as he did in L.A. Also, SMOTHERED CHICKEN, BABY!  Casual fans, meet Croatia’s Mario Hezonja:  You think he cares that he’s battling for minutes under coach Vic Mackey, who tolerates no such nonsense from uppity international rookies? Hell no. He drilled a run-up-the-score 3 during the closing seconds of a Eurobasket blowout, and dapped up the opposing coach. The best part? The coach dapped him back! He once said he has never respected any opponent. When a reporter suggested he watch Lionel Messi in person, Hezonja responded that Messi should come watch him. Hezonja figures to get minutes right away on a Magic team starved for shooting, and he’s going to do crazy stuff. Someone is going to take a swing at him. It might be Scott Skiles. As I’ve written before, the Magic have a ton of interesting individual players, but no coach has successfully fit them together. Skiles will have to find the right balance of shooting and defense among a weird frontcourt that includes two hybrid forwards in Tobias Harris and Aaron Gordon — the NBA’s overexcited version of Tigger. Gordon flashed an improved jumper over the summer, and the Magic approach true positionless basketball when he and Harris share the forward spots. Victor Oladipo has to build on a strong March and April, Nikola Vucevic is a stretch center with a dangerous post game, and Elfrid Payton sees possibilities few even consider. David Steele and Jeff Turner are pros on the broadcast, and all the art looks nice. Give these guys a watch. The Jazz, even without Dante Exum, are not some under-the-radar pick to make the playoffs. They should be considered favorites to snag the no. 8 spot after swapping out perhaps the league’s very worst defender, Enes Kanter, giving most of his minutes to the Stifle Tower, and obliterating opposing offenses during a revelatory second half of last season. Utah won’t sustain that historical stinginess over a full campaign, but the Jazz should be very good, and several members of this deep young core are striding into their primes. The offense can get mechanical — Utah ranked dead last in pace last season — but Quin Snyder coaxing this crew toward Spursy continuity, one pass and cut at a time, is a fun night-to-night growth process. Utah led the league in dunks last season, per NBA Savant, and the French Rejection slams with visceral brutality. If you’re into chess matches, this might be the team to watch night-to-night. Utah is shorting the wider league’s small-ball movement by betting huge on the mammoth Derrick Favors–Rudy Gobert duo, and the outcome of that bet will be one of the NBA’s juiciest big-picture questions over the next few years. If the Jazz are right, they are on a path to championship contention. If they’re wrong, they’ll have to detour. Gobert and Favors are rim-rattlers at heart on offense, and Utah’s spacing can get clunky when they’re both banging below the elbows. Utah needs them to refine their perimeter skills so that they can breathe in small spaces, and both made strides last season — Gobert as a passer, and Favors with midrange jumpers and a workable off-the-bounce game. Opponents will test Utah with small ball, and the smart ones will slot their extra wing onto Gobert — leaving a big on Favors to neuter his more polished post game. To beat small ball, Utah will have to exploit mismatches and play volleyball on the offensive glass. Favors and Gobert envelope the paint on defense, but small-ball teams will test them there, too. Favors will have to chase shooters, and teams that go super small, with shooters at all five positions,3 will present Gobert with a choice: Hang around the rim and leave a shooter open, or guard that shooter and leave the basket vulnerable. Ask Timofey Mozgov about negotiating that choice. Plus: Trevor Booker plays every minute on the edge, flying to the offensive glass and talking trash. Alec Burks is back, Rodney Hood is interesting, Joe Ingles is funny, Snyder makes serial-killer faces, and that musical note logo at center court is perfect. Just avoid the temptation to drink every time Matt Harpring yelps “Jazz Nation!” Honestly? I can’t believe Orlando and Utah finished so low. I love watching these teams. This is either a sign that NBA basketball looks great across the board right now, or that my caveman-simple rating system needs a 538 update. Team DVR is a title contender that bludgeons you with wave after wave of sprinting athletes, but that does not translate to a friendly Wednesday-night watch. The free throw parade is interminable and the broadcast table features the league’s shrillest group of homers. Bill Worrell, the play-by-play guy, is a legend, and both Clyde Drexler and Matt Bullard — the third man, like Hollywood Hogan — know more basketball than I ever could. It’s a shame the rah-rah nonsense and complaints about officiating drown out the insights. The court is ugly, the uniforms mediocre. The basketball product has become underrated amid constant shrieking about how James Harden allegedly sullies the game with his shoulder-shaking, Euro-stepping floppery. Come on. Harden draws fouls because he’s the league’s preeminent expert in using weirdo change-of-pace moves to tip guys off-balance, and when he detects a path to the rim, he’s as explosive as almost anyone. Harden draws fouls because people foul him. Houston figures to reclaim the league’s pace crown with Ty Lawson onboard, and the supporting cast is dotted with colorful characters: Pat Beverley getting inside your jersey and your head; Donatas Motiejunas getting people to lunge at air; Corey Brewer pouring out in transition; and the rising Clint Capela. Houston would score higher in the unintentional-comedy category if Dwight Howard weren’t trying so painfully hard to be funny every minute of his life. Brandon Knight should reinject some of the helter-skelter speed the Suns lost when the Goran Dragic–Eric Bledsoe point guard union disintegrated, and these guys are just generally a happy watch. Jeff Hornacek is willing to run and try unconventional things, and the broadcast team of Steve Albert and Eddie Johnson is a delight — heavy on insight and low-key jokes. The presence of Tyson Chandler picking-and-rolling should nudge Markieff Morris, a sneaky good passer, into more perimeter playmaking, and T.J. Warren is going to dust fools on old-school backdoor cuts. Mirza Teletovic’s hair is immaculate, Alex Len is playing with more confidence, and P.J. Tucker can defend four positions in a pinch. The Halloween-y court still stinks, but at least they brought back the sunburst and used that gorgeous trademark purple for the lane markers. Stop it with the black, already. Gus Johnson! An alternate court! Gorgeous new uniforms and logos! The Greek Freak dribbling the whole court in three strides and gyro-stepping with Jabari Parker! It’s all happening for Milwaukee, the NBA’s random “it” team of the moment, but the Bucks are more a hoops curiosity than a stylistically reliable team — at least on offense. They dealt away two veteran ball movers, Zaza Pachulia and Jared Dudley, for nothing, and recalibrated around two tricky pieces in Michael Carter-Williams and Greg Monroe — a point guard who can’t shoot and a slow-footed post bully who might struggle scrambling in Jason Kidd’s frenzied defense. They may not have enough shooting and overall polish to be as fun to watch as they look on paper. This feels low. Skinny Kyle Lowry tore through preseason like some combination of Michael Jordan and Isiah Thomas; he has literally found another gear and he’s zipping by help defenders who cut him off just last season. Lowry at full throttle is a treat. He dives for loose balls, gambles for steals, and changes directions so fast, it’s almost like he’s bouncing instead of running. He’s small enough at 5-foot-11 that you lose sight of him among the giants, and then, bam, he pops back onto the screen in a different spot. But the Raptors of the Lowry/DeMar DeRozan era have run a stodgy offense of midrangers, overly scripted set plays, and one-on-one hoists. That offense has worked — Toronto ranked third in points per possession last season — but it isn’t exactly popcorn entertainment. That could change this season. DeMarre Carroll lives to pass and move, Patrick Patterson provides more spacing at power forward, and slimmed-down Lowry should do even more damage in the lane. Everyone is watching Jonas Valanciunas. Trade suitors are convinced Toronto is lukewarm on him, and rival executives are curious about how Valanciunas might fare in another system — and whether a post-up 7-footer with so-so feet on defense can flourish in the modern NBA. And nobody — nobody — shills for anything like Jack Armstrong, one of Toronto’s color guys, shills for Miller Genuine Draft. Armstrong screams about “MGD” with such glee, it’s a mild surprise he’s not chugging one when the camera turns back to him. The new logo and court are cool, and the bench brings Luis Scola flippy shots, Bismack Biyombo’s stone hands, Terrence Ross spacing out on defense, and BRUUUUNNO! This is too high in pure basketball terms, but the Knicks have Mike Breen, Walt Frazier, fun celebrity fans, a mysterious giant rookie, and a superstar who can erupt into must-see hot streaks that mix all shot types — quick-release 3s, jab-steppy midrangers, and bruising step-throughs. One lost half-season and it feels like people have forgotten what an offensive powerhouse Carmelo Anthony can be. He is a force. He radiates gravity. When he holds the ball, he controls the behavior of everyone else on the floor. The Knicks are the last triangle holdouts, and every game is a mini-referendum on how the system is goink in the modern NBA. It’s fun when the camera holds on Derek Fisher and you have to decide whether he is dead, sleeping with his eyes open, blatantly disinterested, or a robot that Phil Jackson controls from above. The Knicks have a lot of comic material: Robin Lopez’s remorseless war on mascots; Kyle O’Quinn’s beard and fancy passing; Derrick Williams’s blond dreadlocks; Snakey the Snake; and the return of Sasha Vujacic. How did the NBA survive without his girlish hair and random feuds? Jerian Grant plays a fast, heady pick-and-roll game and Cleanthony Early had moments in preseason. Hope!

103,The Transition Game in Minnesota: LaVine Gets the Nod While Martin Takes a Seat,"There are so many explosive, layered story lines to this NBA season: the LaMarcus Aldridge fit in the Spurs’ culture of sharing; the Warriors’ push to repeat; the franchise-shaking stakes in Oklahoma City; LeBron’s quest to bring a title to a starving city; George Hill’s hair; the return of Kobe Bryant; the ascension of Anthony Davis;1 the Rockets testing the limits of the knucklehead theory; and so much more. But don’t overlook the most glorious, League Pass habit-altering development of the preseason: Zach LaVine is going to start at shooting guard for the Minnesota Timberwolves! LaVine as a rookie became almost a punch line for basketball snobs — the symbol of a shallow sporting culture that cares more about Vines, dunks, and over-rehearsed mean mugs than actual basketball skills. LaVine had no clue how to play NBA defense, or run point guard, the position into which Minnesota almost cruelly shoehorned him after Ricky Rubio’s early-season ankle injury. LaVine was dead last in ESPN’s Real Plus-Minus among 83 point guards. He turned the ball over on a revolting 27 percent of pick-and-rolls he finished with a shot, drawn foul, or cough-up — the 13th-worst rate among 188 ball handlers with at least 50 such possessions, per Synergy Sports. Minnesota was awful regardless of who played, but it was historically awful when poor LaVine was on the floor trying to remember how he had set up the offense the day before in practice. He was objectively terrible, but he became famous because he is just as objectively the greatest dunker the league has seen since peak Vince Carter. Aesthetes held their noses as LaVine’s fame grew: Is he a real basketball player or an empty showman destined to light up pro-am games in late July? We’re about to find out. The Wolves are optimistic that there is substance beneath the glitz, and that the real LaVine, the one that can last in the NBA, will show himself this season upon moving to his natural position. “He has a knack for displays of athleticism, and when you do that, people pigeonhole you,” says Milt Newton, the Wolves GM. “He loves to dunk, but there’s much more to him.” At the most basic level, he’s a diligent worker who cares about his craft — so much so that the Wolves had to politely suggest he stop coming to the gym after midnight. “It was like, ‘Zach, when it’s midnight or 2 a.m., that’s time to rest,’” Newton recalls, laughing. “‘You need to get some sleep.’” LaVine’s spectacular failure last season was predictable, and maybe inevitable. He was a reserve for one season at UCLA and suddenly he was running an NBA offense, negotiating screens, and rotating against sophisticated offenses who viewed him as prey. And with Rubio, Nikola Pekovic, Kevin Martin, Kevin Garnett, and other veterans missing huge chunks of time, he was doing all that amid lineups that didn’t belong in NBA games. Now Rubio is back, and the game will get easier for LaVine. Every coach is dying for wing players who can shoot well enough to play off the ball, then attack with some dynamism and smarts the instant they catch it. That’s why DeMarre Carroll, Khris Middleton, and Danny Green got mega-deals this summer, and why Rick Carlisle talks about Wesley Matthews as the perfect “fit” player for any team.  Dig below the highlights and bloopers, and you can see glimpses of that kind of player with LaVine — a wing who could do damage spotting up around Rubio pick-and-rolls and Andrew Wiggins post-ups. LaVine shot 34 percent from deep last season, below the league average, but that number should jump into the high 30s as LaVine refines his judgment and logs time with NBA-level passers. LaVine shot 41 percent on catch-and-shoot 3s last season, per SportVU data, and he managed that while hoisting some irresponsible ultra-distance shots with dudes right in his face. Only 30 players launched more often from beyond 26 feet, per NBA Savant, and LaVine’s addiction to contested heaves feeds the comparisons with another shoot-first, highlight-machine combo guard: Jamal Crawford. Dial back the chucking, especially early in the shot clock, and LaVine’s accuracy should improve. He has a nice stroke, and he can jump high enough to get a clear look over defenders rushing out at him. He’s a good enough shooter to keep defenders honest — to give Rubio, Wiggins, and Karl-Anthony Towns room to attack the paint, then punish opponents who sag off of him to contain that penetration. LaVine has a ridiculous first step he can use to blow by defenders who close out on him after Rubio swings the ball. LaVine’s insane jumping ability has overshadowed how fast he is. When he catches on the wing and drives without hesitating, he gets to the basket so fast, he almost seems surprised when he arrives there. When he’s airborne, his body is flying to the rim so fast that LaVine almost doesn’t have time to prepare a normal, coordinated layup. He literally can’t control himself; he tosses up discombobulated, high-speed flick shots that look more complicated than they need to be. “He’s at the basket before he even knows it,” Newton says. Part of it, Minny officials say, is that LaVine is unsure how to deal with contact from help defenders. “It’s like he’s trying to avoid contact that isn’t there while he’s shooting,” Newton says. LaVine has to be more decisive — and has to make better decisions. There were times late last season when LaVine would catch the ball behind the arc, pump fake a defender sprinting out at him, coax that defender off-balance, and then take a lazy side-dribble into a long pull-up 2 — or nothing at all. Better stuff was right there for the taking, but LaVine wouldn’t seize it. “He’s not at the point where he understands when to drive, when to pull up, and when to shoot it,” Newton says. “But we think he can get there. He wants to be great.” The raw materials are here for a modern complementary NBA wing: catch it, move immediately into a triple try or a drive, and if you penetrate, be ready to whip a smart pass to a teammate spotting up on the weak side. It’s going to take time, especially on defense, where LaVine looked like that kid at recess chasing birds as a game unfolded around him. He’d get lost on rotations, veering toward one shooter, realizing that guy was someone else’s responsibility, and then looping aimlessly toward a spot where another enemy player might be. He got confused on switches, though when he did swap onto a bigger player, he fought hard for position on the block. He ran smack into picks like Sideshow Bob stepping on rakes, and he was helpless in trying to divide his attention between his man and the ball. He’d face-guard Steph Curry on the wing, turn to gawk at the action in the middle, and swivel his head back only to find that Curry had vanished. Most young guys struggle on defense, but some of it is instinctual and LaVine was behind the curve — even for a rookie. He’ll get better — he shows good footwork and balance changing directions — but at 6-foot-5, he’ll be at a size disadvantage against lots of wings. He can’t afford an intellectual disadvantage. If he remains a defensive liability, perhaps LaVine’s destiny will be as a hot lava bench guy in the mold of Crawford or J.R. Smith — a hybrid scoring guard who survives defending backups and mixes in a ton with starters. LaVine is a better pure athlete than either of those guys, and he should resist the temptation to dawdle with the ball like they do. If he manages that, LaVine can grow into a modern NBA wing — at least on offense. Which is ironic, since he’s displacing a former star who looks more like an anachronism with every passing season. ??? Bernard Weil/Toronto Star via Getty Images It wasn’t long ago that Kevin Martin was freaking awesome — an advanced-stats darling who canned 3s, got to the line at an absurd rate, and did enough on offense that you could almost ignore the damage he inflicted on the other end. He’s still pretty good; he averaged 21.5 points per 36 minutes last season, and he’s clearly a better player than LaVine today. The Wolves don’t really care. “We want to put the best possible team on the floor, but not just for the present,” Newton says. “We have to develop young players. You may not like coming off the bench as a veteran, but if that’s the role we give you, we expect you to embrace it.” Martin was meant for a playoff contender centered around Kevin Love. LaVine is Flip Saunders’s “home run” shot for the future. Martin doesn’t feel as well suited for the NBA of the 2010s — the NBA where Tom Thibodeau’s overloading defenses forced teams to get creative on offense and keep the ball flying side-to-side. Martin’s not really a catch-and-go guy off the ball, and he’s not a lead dog pick-and-roll distributor who picks out shooters all over the floor. He has cracked three assists per 36 minutes just once in his career. He likes to run off screens, catch the ball, survey the landscape, and go to work one-on-one.2 He’s a good shooter, but he still jacks too many long 2s — especially after curling around a pick, Kyle Korver– and J.J. Redick–style. Only 25 percent of the shots Martin took per game were 3s, per Synergy Sports. Almost half of Redick’s shots in those situations were 3s, and 75 percent of Korver’s came from beyond the arc. Martin’s a very good shooter, but his unconventional release takes a ton of time to load up; he just can’t launch as fast as those other guys. If a defender gets lost under a pick, Martin has time to let fly. He also likes to nail contested 3s over smaller defenders who can’t bother his vision, even if they are standing almost in Martin’s jersey for the entirety of his windup. Martin subsists mostly on midrange shots and by using his weirdo herky-jerky moves to goad unwitting defenders into “fouling” him. That trickery just doesn’t work as well as it used to, since the NBA decided the rip-through wasn’t a real move worthy of shooting fouls. Oh, Martin still punks some fools. He’ll catch the ball up top, make a big show of looking to his right as if a screen is coming, wait for the defender to peek for that pick, and then take a single dribble the other way — and right into his defender’s arm. The second Martin feels contact, usually after just one dribble, he’s launching. Sometimes he gets the call and even nails some goofy floater. Sometimes the refs roll their eyes and an ugly shot bangs off the rim. He’s almost like a rich man’s Lou Williams, and just as Williams collapsed in the postseason for Toronto when officials wouldn’t tolerate his crap, Martin’s teams have cratered in crunch time to an almost absurd degree. Martin’s skills just aren’t as valuable as they used to be, and that makes his utter inability to defend anyone an intolerable blemish for some teams. But he’s still a valuable bench scorer on an affordable $7.1 million contract, and teams that need a little extra juice should take a hard look at him. Martin has a $7.4 million player option for next season, but that shouldn’t be a dealbreaker for anyone other than a Washington/Miami/Houston type carving out a specific amount of cap space for use on a specific target. And if Martin plays well, he should turn that option down to snag one last long-term contract at age 33. Minnesota doesn’t need any more young guys, and Newton swears the Wolves don’t want to trade Martin. But Minnesota is out two future first-rounders;3 it would be nice to recoup one, or even to acquire another player between the ages of 21 and 40. Minnesota almost certainly won’t get a first-round pick for Martin, but there will be workable deals out there — especially after December 15, when free agents signed last summer become tradable. Some contender or playoff hopeful will struggle, feel desperate, and get ready to talk turkey. Charlotte just lost Michael Kidd-Gilchrist for the season, and the Hornets are under enormous pressure to make the playoffs. They’re holding strong for now, but they’d have to think about a deal involving Jeremy Lamb and filler for a more proven guy like Martin. A 2-for-1 deal like that would leave Minnesota with one too many guaranteed contracts, but the Wolves could just waive someone cheap, or send an extra player into the Philly/Portland/Utah cap space. The Lamb type — a young flop, basically — is the target that makes the most sense for the Wolves. If the Kings even considered dealing Ben McLemore for Martin, the NBA should just burn the franchise down, but you can’t put anything past the Kings. Vince Carter looked washed up last season, and Matt Barnes just (allegedly) attacked an NBA head coach. Maybe the Wolves would listen to a deal involving Carter (another ancient veteran leader!), a minor prospect, and a distant Griz second-rounder? The Mavs will be hungry for wing talent if Matthews and Chandler Parsons start slowly, and they haven’t sent any signals — yet — that they’d tank to keep their top-seven protected pick if they fall too far behind. Would Minnesota take Raymond Felton, one young prospect (John Jenkins? Maurice Ndour?), and a future second-rounder in a deal that also saves it some scratch? Chicago could use some shooting and punch on the wing, but it’s hard to find a workable deal there. How much would the Heat pay to trim their tax bill and acquire another useful bench scorer? The Pacers need all the wings they can get to play small ball, especially since it’s hard to slot Monta Ellis and Rodney Stuckey together in some lineups, and they have Chase Budinger’s handy $5 million contract sitting there. The problem there is that Indiana likes Budinger’s shooting and ability to work as a small-ball power forward — as he did toward the end of last season in Minny — and it would have to send him to a third team, since rules forbid Minnesota from reacquiring Budinger this season. The Wiz want to play smaller, and some injury on the wing — or just a longer-than-expected recovery timetable for Jared Dudley — could nudge them into some win-now deal. Both New York teams are chasing wins to avoid coughing up lottery picks, though they have very little that is really worth Minny’s (or anyone’s) attention. The Magic could use some outside shooting and shot creation, though Scott Skiles — looking more and more like Vic Mackey — might straight-up murder Martin at some point. You could go on and on. Martin is a useful player on an easily tradable midsize contract, and he plays a thin position in a league with more teams actually trying to win. Minnesota won’t get a ton for Martin, or for Nikola Pekovic, another good player who looks out of place in the pace-and-space era. LaVine has the tools to thrive in that kind of environment. I can’t wait to see him try.",2015-10-09T13:57:17+00:00,NBA,Lowe
104,The Edge of Glory: Will the Clippers Make the Leap or Hit Reset?,"The Clippers have had three cracks at it with Chris Paul, Blake Griffin, and DeAndre Jordan all in their primes, and they’re not afraid to admit the fourth could be their last — that another flameout will force them to ask whether the core has grown stale. “We’re right on the borderline,” Doc Rivers tells Grantland during a long sit-down at his office. “I have no problem saying that. I’m a believer that teams can get stale. After a while, you don’t win. It just doesn’t work. We’re right at the edge. Oklahoma City is on the edge. Memphis, too. We just have to accept it.” Maybe Rivers is worrying too much. The Clippers have won at least 56 games in three straight seasons; they could play blindfolded and finish with one of the league’s five best offenses; Griffin and Jordan are nowhere near 30; and they’ve taken out the Warriors and Spurs in the past two postseasons. When your core can win at that level, the smart play is to keep it together and wait for breaks to fall your way — to be the 2011 Mavericks, basically. But repeated heartbreaks within the bloody Western Conference can warp a team’s self-perception. Every flaw becomes magnified. Every last-second loss feeds the internal anxiety that you have to be perfect. In 2013, the Clippers gagged a 2-0 lead in the first round against Memphis amid injuries to both Paul and Griffin. A year later, they were a minute from going up 3-2 in the second round against Oklahoma City, with Game 6 coming in L.A., before Paul suffered his worst clutch meltdown. They still have trouble discussing last season’s second-round collapse against the relentless Rockets, when the Clippers were up 3-2 and ahead by 19 points with less than 15 minutes left in Game 6 … at home. “The more I tried to process it, the angrier I got,” J.J. Redick says. “I’m not saying we definitely would have beaten Golden State, but if you make the conference finals, you have a chance. I’ve given up trying to explain what happened.” “You hope it’s not an opportunity you never get again,” Jamal Crawford says. The team was shell-shocked, relieved they had an extra day off to decompress ahead of Game 7, Crawford remembers. It didn’t matter; Houston walloped them again. “I’m in my 16th year, and that was my best chance ever at getting to the Finals,” he says. Players admitted they were tired after racing through 14 fast-paced games against the Spurs and Rockets with a bench that featured two viable NBA players — one of whom was Austin Rivers. After falling on his face in his first year as GM, Doc Rivers overhauled that bench by signing Paul Pierce, Josh Smith, Wesley Johnson, Pablo Prigioni, and Cole Aldrich on the cheap, and flipping Spencer Hawes for Lance Stephenson in a trade of outcasts — a brilliant gamble for a team with no other realistic means to acquire young talent. Fatigue shouldn’t be an issue this time around. Rivers says he won’t accept exhaustion as an excuse for the Houston debacle, even as he brings up the epic exertion required to outlast San Antonio. “Me and Pop [Gregg Popovich] were joking afterward,” Rivers recalls, “about how the winner of that series might have really lost. It took its toll.” Rivers says his team didn’t take Houston seriously. He had to repeat himself in film sessions and walk-throughs. “San Antonio got our full attention,” Rivers says. “The Rockets, for whatever reason, didn’t.” Rivers praises Houston for rallying, but he remembers every Clippers mistake and every perceived injustice from the officials in alarming detail. There was a Corey Brewer and-1 early in the fourth quarter of Game 6 to cut L.A.’s lead to nine that should have been a charge, Rivers says, and Dwight Howard picking up a flagrant foul and a technical foul in separate incidents. “Dwight was doing everything he could to get thrown out,” Rivers recalls. “He had one flagrant, and he probably should have had another. But credit those guys. They fought.” Some players, damningly, agree with Rivers’s claim that they didn’t grant Houston enough respect. “We weren’t on guard against Houston,” says Jamal Crawford. “We never thought we could lose three in a row to them.” The Clippers relaxed when things were easy and froze up when the Rockets made them difficult. That sounds like a team that should be asking whether it lacks some indefinable championship quality, but the Clippers aren’t going there — yet. “I know we have that mettle,” Crawford says, citing road wins in San Antonio to even last year’s series at 2-2 and 3-3. “I know we have a special group.” They’re taking the rationalist’s view of life in the West: If we keep winning, fate will eventually smile our way. “The championship window in the West is so narrow,” Redick says. “Ours might only be open another couple of years. But you need some breaks. Golden State was the best team in the league, but they also had everything go right for them. They didn’t have one bad break. I don’t have any doubt about the DNA of our team.” Rivers agrees. “You need luck in the West,” he says. “Look at Golden State. They didn’t have to play us or the Spurs. But that’s also a lesson for us: When you have a chance to close, you have to do it.” No one can afford to sit still in the West, but for now, the Clippers are betting that a few small changes are enough to keep up with Golden State, San Antonio, Oklahoma City, Houston, and every other turbocharged beast. They might be right. ??? It sometimes seems like the Clippers make things harder than they have to be, especially on defense, where Rivers prefers a frantic, hyperaggressive scheme. He has Jordan and especially Griffin chase pick-and-rolls beyond the 3-point arc, leaving three L.A. defenders to patrol four opposing players below the ball:   It’s a bold scheme that looks out of place in a league of Tom Thibodeau copycats who prefer that their big men hang back — even if doing so concedes some open midrange jumpers. Rivers’s scheme in theory concedes nothing, and that’s why he likes it. “The thing about my defense,” Rivers says, “is that it’s a great defense for the playoffs.” The traps force opposing point guards to give the ball up, and when the Clippers rotate in sync with each enemy pass, they snuff every open look until the shot clock nears zero:  The issue, of course, is that the best teams win that race just enough over 48 minutes and seven games. The Clips sunk to 16th in points allowed per possession last season after finishing ninth the year before,1 and they’ve fallen off against elite offenses in the playoffs. “Listen,” Redick says, “for us to win it, we have to get better on defense. We have not been on par with championship teams.” The Clippers make opponents pass, but all of that passing and driving can lead to 3s; only five teams allowed more 3-point attempts last season, though L.A. did well to limit corner 3s. Zigzagging defenders who fall a half-step behind tend to reach for desperate fouls. Only Denver allowed more free throws per field goal attempt last season, according to NBA.com. Jordan challenged about three fewer shots at the rim per 36 minutes than most other behemoth basket protectors, since Rivers’s scheme often had him hounding little dudes 30 feet from the hoop. The Clippers were a good defensive rebounding team, but they could be impervious if Jordan and Griffin spent more time around the rim. All things considered, the Clippers fared well playing this way. But that system is exhausting, and you got the sense even when they were rolling that the Clippers were working too hard for an uncertain return. Nonpublic analytics from other teams show that the Clippers allowed a very high expected field goal percentage — in other words, that a team allowing those same shots2 should end up with a bottom-10 defense. The Clippers finished better than that, but it felt at times like they were running uphill. After an offseason of reflection, the Clippers are easing into a more conservative scheme. Jordan and Griffin will stick around the paint more instead of leaping out like madmen. “We’re gonna make some changes,” says Rivers, “and we want DJ to be closer to the rim.” Rivers and Lawrence Frank, the team’s defensive coordinator, have the team working out the kinks in the preseason:  The goal is to play the pick-and-roll 2-on-2 so that the other L.A. defenders can glue themselves to shooters instead of darting in to help on a big rolling to the rim and then darting back out toward their original guy.3 The Clips will serve up more open midrangers this way, but over 100 possessions, the numbers should tilt in a good direction: fewer 3s and fouls, better defensive rebounding. An added bonus: The core has years of collective memory playing the old way, and they can revert to it against postseason opponents that require amped-up aggression. You can’t play soft against Stephen Curry or Kevin Durant. Griffin and Jordan are both fast enough to hang with super-small lineups, including Golden State groups featuring Draymond Green at center, and Griffin can defuse possessions by switching on to wing players. If the Clippers get a stop and run out, that smaller guy will often be stuck guarding Griffin — opening up an easy post-up option. “Blake has to be better on defense,” Rivers said. “He’s good, but he can be great.” And in Stephenson, they finally have the long, burly wing capable of at least hanging with Durant, LeBron, Kawhi Leonard, and other studs. (For what it’s worth, Rivers thinks Johnson has a shot against them, too, even though he brings a track record of shaky defense. “We watched him in the gym the other day and just said, ‘Fuck, you can defend!’” Rivers says, laughing. “‘Where the fuck has that been?’”) “Lance is absolutely our no. 1 option against all those guys,” Rivers says. He also wants Stephenson pitching in on bigger point guards so Paul can rest a bit on defense. Stephenson just has to prove he won’t murder the Clippers offense. ??? Those secret-sauce numbers show the same effect with the Clippers offense: They outperform their shot chart more than perhaps4 any other team in the league. Only seven teams took more midrange jumpers last season, and Griffin jacked more dead-zone 2-pointers — from outside 20 feet but inside the arc — than any other player, per NBA Savant. He hit 41 percent of those, which sounds nice until you consider that burps up the same points per possession as one of Jordan’s misadventures at the foul line. Griffin might be able to turn some of those longer pick-and-pop 2s into 3s, though drifting out that far makes it harder for him to thread those gorgeous lobs to Jordan. The Clippers can’t drive the ball to the rim, either; only the Knicks recorded fewer drives, per SportVU data. Griffin and Jordan (and their defenders) are in the way, and opponents sagged way off Matt Barnes. They figure to do the same against both Stephenson and Johnson, the probable fifth starter. That the Clippers have thrived within such tight spacing is a tribute to the brilliance of their four holdover starters and Rivers’s ability to plant everyone in the right positions. Paul and Griffin can slip passes through teensy slivers, and the threat of a Jordan alley-oop makes shot-blockers paranoid about helping when the Clippers do penetrate. “He’s like Shaq in that way,” Rivers says of Jordan. Redick draws extra defenders as he flies around picks, and Rivers uses the sides of the floor to open up ping-ping-ping passing sequences. “Doc is great at teaching spacing,” Redick says. “Every foot counts.” Right when the Clippers look jammed up, they zip into a corner 3. This is a pristine ecosystem. Whether introducing Stephenson screws it up is one of the biggest questions the Clippers face — especially if they need his defense as much as Rivers anticipates. Stephenson shot an unthinkable 17 percent from deep last season, and while that will end up an outlier, he has sniffed the league average only once in five seasons. He’s never done much off-ball cutting, a key skill for any ignored wing spotting up around Paul and Griffin; Barnes was great at it. Rivers has to sort this out and discover whether his son, Stephenson, and Crawford can share the ball on second units. “You can figure it out on the whiteboard, but that shit doesn’t really work,” Rivers says. “You have to figure it out on the court.” On the brighter side, Stephenson will get wide-open looks and long driving runways in L.A. If he attacks instantly on the catch, without going into one of his ridiculous circus dribbling shows, his playmaking could compensate for his jumper in the same way Barnes’s cutting did. If everything fits, the Clips will have more options on those nights when a locked-in defense strangles the paint — as Houston did in humiliating the Clippers during that infamous Game 6. The easiest choice is to slot Pierce into the crunch-time five along with the rest of the starters. The Clips should be borderline unguardable with another ace shooter on the wing. Rivers is toying with starting Pierce, but he is reluctant to have the geezer chase wing players over extended minutes. Rivers also likes the notion of maintaining a five-man small-ball bench mob of Austin Rivers, Stephenson, Crawford, Pierce, and Smith. Regardless, Pierce will be on the floor in the clutch to loosen the spacing and jack some daggers. Too much of that crunch-time burden has fallen on Paul, and if Griffin and Jordan are on the floor, it’s hard for him to generate anything better than contested midrangers. The Clippers are afraid to give Jordan the ball late, and smart defenses erase Griffin’s post game by sliding centers onto him if necessary; Houston used Howard as a late-game Griffin antidote during last year’s playoffs. When Rivers really needs to juice the offense late, he can yank Jordan in favor of a Pierce-Griffin small-ball frontcourt. The Clippers naturally resist small ball, since two of their foundational stars are big men. Griffin and Jordan are mobile enough to hang with small-ball lineups on defense, and they can leverage their size to brutalize them on the other end. Griffin can demolish wings in the post, and if opponents assign their extra wing to Jordan, they risk death on the glass. But downsizing is a nice card to play for one or two key possessions late, and if the Pierce-Griffin front line works, perhaps Rivers will find a way to use it — or other lineups with Griffin at center, including the Smith-Griffin combo — during other parts of the game. Rivers is weirdly opposed to staggering minutes so that either Paul or Griffin is on the floor at all times. That may not be an urgent need during the regular season, since Crawford, Stephenson, and Smith are smart playmakers. But opponents destroyed the Clippers when both Griffin and Paul were on the bench last season, and in high-stakes games, they may not be able to afford any empty minutes. The Clippers need more things to flip right than the Warriors and Spurs, and perhaps one or two other teams in the West. They need to answer questions about their defense, their bench, Stephenson’s fit, Pierce’s durability, and their readiness for the next big playoff moment. They have a smaller margin for error than Golden State and Cleveland, but if enough of those questions turn the right way, the Clips have the goods to contend. If they fall short again, will Rivers decide to shake things up? Good luck. Griffin and Jordan have massive trade value, and dealing one of them for multiple pieces would open up the lane for easier pick-and-rolls; the Clips went 9-6 without Griffin last season5 in part because Paul and Jordan found a new pick-and-roll chemistry with the lane uncluttered. But the Clippers can’t just deal one of them for future assets as long as Paul is around. A 30-year-old point guard with a history of knee issues can’t wait out a step backward. Paul is movable even amid a glut of point guards, but he’s good only for the “win now” types, and dealing him would amount to a complete reconstruction of how L.A. plays. Rivers isn’t quite ready to think about specific changes yet, even as he acknowledges he might have to be in seven or eight months. “We’re all on that edge together,” he says. “I believe we’re gonna be really good. But if we’re not, it depends on how we play, and what the reason is. That’s what would make you make a big decision.”",2015-10-06T09:02:01+00:00,2015 NBA Preview,Lowe
105,Why Harrison Barnes Could Be the Most Intriguing Free Agent of 2016,"Harrison Barnes heard the chuckling when news broke that he had turned down a four-year, $64 million extension. “Everyone asks, ‘Someone is really going to pay all that for a guy who can’t run the pick-and-roll?’” Barnes tells Grantland, laughing. “But I don’t worry much. I’m confident I will get better at it.” The mystery of Barnes, and the mystery of whether he’ll stay with Golden State, is that he may never get to show off that theoretical improvement on the Warriors. He’s a back-end option on a championship team of stars and expert passers. He’s a finisher, not a creator, and the team’s best bench player is his direct backup. He mostly stands in the corner for some of the easiest triples in the league, or cuts for dunks when defenses ignore him. “He has the potential to do more, but it’s tricky,” says Warriors coach Steve Kerr. “We have a lot of people who can really play.” Barnes gets it, and Golden State’s coaches say he has never complained — not once — about his touches. Barnes was perhaps the most famous high school player in the nation five years ago, the next Kobe, and he’s squeezed himself into a role in which he uses only about 15 percent of Golden State’s possessions — a tiny number we’d normally associate with a limited role player. “It just may not be in the cards for me to create more here,” Barnes says, “but I can do it, and maybe this season there will be more opportunities.” Barnes turned down $16 million per year, in the neighborhood of the new deals for DeMarre Carroll, Khris Middleton, and Tobias Harris — and a hair north of what Danny Green could have snared had he been willing to venture outside the San Antonio cocoon. Green and Carroll work as comparables for Barnes: ace spot-up shooters with shaky ballhandling chops who battle on defense, rarely get to the line, dish few assists, and slot into a supporting role. Barnes is only 23, younger than everyone in that group but Harris, and perhaps the best-equipped among them to defend power forwards — a key skill that unlocks small-ball lineups and switchy defenses for the Warriors. “His versatility is what the league is all about now,” Kerr says. Even if Barnes never seizes a larger role, he’ll get better at the things that make up his current job. That improved version of Barnes is probably “worth” a bit more than $16 million per year, especially as the cap leaps from $70 million to $90 million next season — and then likely into the triple digits. Barnes is right to bet on someone offering him a max deal — averaging as much as $23 million per season — if he gets to free agency. There is too much cap money for a blah free-agent class. That exploding money factored into Barnes’s decision to fire his old agent, Jeff Wechsler, and hire the powerhouse Jeff Schwartz. Barnes is pushing back against the standard 4 percent agent commission, league sources told Grantland last week, arguing that those old rules shouldn’t apply to new money.1 Any team dangling a max contract at Barnes will be betting there is a borderline star ready to smash through the walls that Golden State’s infrastructure places around him. It will scour the film for glimpses of that player and comb the numbers for signs that Barnes has made subtle advances in the skills any no. 2 option has to have. The Warriors are right to bargain as if that player may never exist, and if Barnes won’t accept less than the max, they can let him enter free agency — and match any offer he gets. They will not lose him for nothing. But the higher Barnes’s price, the harder Golden State has to think about using that giant salary slot on two or three rotation pieces instead of one guy who falls in line behind Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green. If Barnes can’t shoulder a larger burden on offense, he’s Jeff Green with a 3-point shot that is still semi-unproven outside the corners — a nice player, but not a great one. Small forward is thin leaguewide, and teams can trick themselves into overspending just to fill thin positions. That rationale can work in the right set of circumstances, but it can backfire when it costs you depth. Remember: The league and union project the cap to fall from $108 million in 2017-18 to about $100 million the following year, and a work stoppage between now and then2 could rearrange the league’s entire salary structure. A max deal for Barnes signed next summer, under a $90 million cap, won’t hurt as much when the cap creeps up, but it’ll still hurt if Barnes can’t make a leap. With Curry’s salary set to nearly triple in 2017-18, every extra dollar of flexibility below the tax matters. A leap would mean doing more with the ball, and the Warriors under Kerr barely let Barnes run the pick-and-roll. When Barnes grabbed a leading role, the results too often looked like this:  Barnes was 7-of-24 out of the pick-and-roll last season, with an ungodly turnover rate, per Synergy Sports. Hell, even a lot of the successful Barnes-dominant plays ended with pull-up midrangers:  Golden State pushed for the no. 1 spot in points per possession last season precisely by avoiding these shots. Critics envision a Barnes-centric offense as a hail of bricky midrange jumpers — a low-efficiency clunker. Barnes just hasn’t looked comfortable driving with the ball, and he knows it. He gets tunnel vision, forcing up shots when easy passes are available. He doesn’t have the fluid change of pace the best ball handlers use to prod defenses open. He sometimes spooks at the first sight of a help defender, as if he’s afraid to make mistakes. He doesn’t appear to feel the game. What happens when defenses trap him against the pick-and-roll? Or go under picks, daring him to can off-the-dribble 3s? The Warriors gave Barnes a bunch of chances at little elbow pick-and-rolls when he slid to power forward, and they too often went nowhere.  “I’m terrible at that play,” Barnes says, laughing. “Luke Walton [a Golden State assistant] and I literally joke about how bad I am at it.” A first or second option finds something there — a lob to Andrew Bogut rolling, a slicing drive-and-dish to Draymond Green in the right corner, or a pass back to Thompson on the left side as his man crashes down on Bogut. Every option is there for a beat, but Barnes was one note behind the ensemble. He’s adamant he can make all of those reads, and that he fell into a bad habit last season of getting trigger-happy when Kerr ran plays for him. “When you don’t get the ball much, sometimes you try to create your offense,” Barnes says. “That’s on me. I have to make the simple pass. I can make those plays.” Maybe he’s right. Barnes has cycled through at least three Golden State player development coaches over the last year, and he’s spent the summer working on his ballhandling from different spots on the floor. Coaches say he has killed in scrimmages over the last month, and he showed hints last season of a more nuanced game.  Shaun Livingston bends the defense just enough here to give Barnes a head start against a ground-bound center, but Barnes does the rest — the no-hesitation drive, the crossover, the soft lefty finish. He reminds one a bit of Kawhi Leonard two years ago in this way: Barnes plays in a flowing offense that naturally spits him out in places where he can catch the ball and shift right into playmaking mode. Barnes defers in those situations, passing the baton to the next guy. Leonard rose up once Gregg Popovich freed him to stretch himself when the offense organically presented an opportunity. Perhaps the same could happen for Barnes. Even a great team could use an extra dash of unpredictability. “Now that we’ve been successful,” Barnes says, “maybe Coach Kerr will loosen things a bit.” Kerr likes Barnes’s pull-up game. Barnes can rise up over almost any wing player, and it’s the kind of hero shot every team needs as the clock winds down. But the Warriors know that things flow better with Barnes off the ball. Good news, then: Barnes was much more decisive last season after catching a pass, and he leveraged his killer corner shooting into a weaponized pump fake:   The “Harrison Barnes, no. 1 option” ship has sailed, but if he rises to no. 2 status someplace else, he’s going to make plays like these after starting a possession off the ball. Viewed through one lens, they reaffirm every cackling criticism. Look how open the guy is! Oh, what life must be like chilling as Curry draws a double-team and kicks to one of the league’s best passing big men. When Barnes drives, he gets to attack the other team’s weakest defender. These luxuries won’t present themselves in Charlotte or with the Lakers. And, holy cow, he misses both shots, mostly because he jumps at weird times and gets fancy with the ball around the rim. “It’s a constant source of frustration for the coaches,” Barnes says. “You probably saw 30 or 40 missed bunnies. I have a tendency to kind of move the ball around up there. I have to go up through contact. The coaches are always talking about free throws.” Barnes averaged just 2.3 free throws per 36 minutes last season, a career low, and that number has to be better. No one saw Jimmy Butler as a pick-and-roll threat worthy of a megadeal until he started putting his head down and barreling through suckers. You could read those misses at the rim as encouraging: Barnes is super-explosive, so close to the spectacular. He watches a ton of film, and he’s searching for passes that might be better alternatives to these acrobatic finishes — drop-offs to his big men and skips to the opposite corner. “I have never met a player so obsessed,” says Darren Erman, a Pelicans assistant who worked with Barnes for two years in Golden State. “Harrison wants to be great.” The same contact phobia infects his post game, which the Warriors view as a crucial tool going forward. They called for a handful of Barnes post-ups in the playoffs against Courtney Lee and James Harden, and Barnes was smarter about flashing into deep position for easier looks:  But he’s not good enough yet at sensing when he has an opponent off-balance, and then pouncing. When Barnes goads a defender off his feet, he needs to nail him with some kind of step-through instead of settling for a meek fadeaway. It’s not as if he’s allergic to contact. Barnes shot 29-of-57 on isolations last season, per Synergy Sports, ranking as one of the league’s best one-on-one players, and he has a nice touch on floaters amid heavy traffic:  He maintained a strong shooting mark after two, three, or four dribbles, reversing a trend that saw his efficiency plummet whenever he bounced the ball, per SportVU data. But critics even spin this negatively: Barnes plays so much small-ball power forward, he gets to attack slower big guys off the bounce! Barnes’s reel of one-on-one glory is filled with him blowing past Dirk Nowitzki, Brandan Wright, and other plodders. He won’t be able to do that against wings. Still, Barnes plausibly defending power forwards is a big part of his value. It separates him from most other spot-up wings, including his current teammates. The Warriors are deep, but Barnes is not redundant — especially as Andre Iguodala ages. If Barnes can defend power forwards, opponents face a choice: go small and risk losing a pace-and-space battle, or ask one of their two bigs to chase a wing player. If that player isn’t Barnes, hopefully it’s someone else — like, I dunno, Iguodala — who can exploit the speed gap. Golden State has oversold Barnes’s work against Zach Randolph in the playoffs. He battled Z-Bo, but he needed near-automatic doubles in the post; that was the point of having Bogut play free safety off of Tony Allen. Barnes jostled with Tristan Thompson in the Finals, and though Thompson ate a bit on the offensive glass, the Warriors banked on Barnes doing just enough to tilt the equation their way. They were right. Barnes isn’t a great defensive player against bigs or wings, but he’s solid, and he should get better as the speed of NBA rotations — which can confuse him now — becomes second nature. Barnes embraced the grunt work. He’s a good rebounder, and he could be a great one for a wing. He had never worked much as an off-ball cutter before arriving in Golden State, and he was a reluctant pupil at first. He ran half-speed, he says, unsure of where to go and when, or whether he’d ever get the ball. Walton pestered him during film sessions, and Barnes accepted his new lot in life. Seriously, watch him cut: He is hyperalert at hunting chances, and he jets to his spots. “He is a great cutter,” Kerr says. We saw in Miami, when Dwyane Wade and LeBron James teamed up, that even stars need to cut when they join other stars. Barnes isn’t a star, but if any team sees him as a high-priced sidekick to one, it’s nice to have the skills already polished. His hunger for drudgery gives the lie to the worst stereotype some rival executives hold against him: that his middle-class upbringing in Iowa turned Barnes complacent — that he doesn’t have “the dog” inside of him. “I hear that a lot,” Barnes says. “It’s funny to me, because to be a good rebounder or cutter, you have to do something five or six times before you see any reward.” But Barnes has ambitions beyond his current role, and some team will pay him at that level if it gets the chance. There have been enough glimpses to justify that Barnes in his prime could be a versatile but expensive second option on a good team. The Warriors have already locked up a first and second option, and considering how often Green handles the ball, probably a third. Maxing out Barnes feels like a suboptimal use of resources. It will cost them quality role players at some point. If Golden State can coax him into an $18 million annual deal now, it should. Barnes might accept that to lock in some security ahead of a potential lockout,3 and because both $18 million and $23 million per year represent a ton of freaking money in the end. If things go to the wire, Golden State could offer the same kind of fake max contract it gave Thompson — a deal that sets Barnes’s salary as a straight dollar amount equivalent to the current projected max, rather than a percentage of the cap. That worked with Thompson as a hedge against a last-minute jump in the actual cap, from $66 million to $70 million, and the same thing could happen next July. No one knows. Cutting it that close to the max might not be worth Golden State’s while. At that point, it can let Barnes creep into free agency and match another team’s max offer — a deal capped at four years, with smaller annual raises. If he blows up in the meantime, the Warriors are thrilled to pay that deal. If he plateaus, they hold their noses, sign it, and trade him later — or work the sign-and-trade market with a team stoked to pay Barnes the max. That would be a bad bet based on what Barnes has shown in the NBA. But he’s itching to show more, and even if he doesn’t, his basic skill set is worth at least DeMarre Carroll money — and probably more, given Barnes’s age. The Warriors are on the clock, and a league of potential suitors is watching.",2015-09-29T08:59:25+00:00,2015 NBA Preview,Lowe
106,"Ciao, Gallo! The Rebirth of Danilo Gallinari (and Maybe the Denver Nuggets)","Danilo Gallinari is, somehow, still here. He is one of just three players remaining from the 2012-13 Nuggets, the 57-win NBA race car that looked, during sublime moments of chaos, like it might outrun the trope that a team needs a top-10 superstar to contend. He is also, in many ways, the symbol of that team’s downfall; his severe ACL injury in April 2013, a few weeks before the playoffs, was the first in a chain of events that exploded an entire team in less than two months. “That’s really what got us fired, if you think about it,” says George Karl, the current Kings coach who as the Nuggets coach embraced a quirky run-and-gun style perfect for Denver’s mile-high air. “Put it this way: There have been more than a few times when I have thought about what might have happened in Denver if Gallo hadn’t gotten hurt.”1 Gallinari has since morphed into a stand-in for the aimlessness of a franchise trapped, by its own doing, in the inescapable NBA dead zone of mediocrity. He stood on the sidelines for all of 2013-14, recovering from multiple knee surgeries as the team fragmented during the mopey and mismatched Brian Shaw era. Players left, losses mounted, Ty Lawson’s off-court issues ran him out of town, Shaw got fired. What had been a proud, fiery team exultant in its unique identity sank into an unrecognizable malaise. Denver seemed to recognize that when it dealt Arron Afflalo and Timofey Mozgov for extra draft goodies; the Nuggets were primed, finally, for a total rebuild. Maybe the other veterans were next to go. And then something funny happened: Gallinari went bananas over 24 games after the All-Star break, averaging 19 points per game on 44 percent shooting, including 40 percent from deep, and playing as the multi-positional jack-of-all-trades Denver envisioned when it nabbed him as the centerpiece of the Carmelo Anthony deal.2 It was tempting to dismiss Gallo’s surge as springtime numbers-grabbing on a terrible team, but he kept it up in leading Italy to the quarterfinals at Eurobasket this month. Gallinari might be all the way back, and he just turned 27. That should be an indisputably good thing for Denver, and it probably is. But it’s fitting that the return of the Rooster raises questions for perhaps the league’s most confusing franchise. Can he stay healthy? And can he sustain this form over a full season? Gallinari came into the league with back issues, and he’s recovering from tears in both his ACL and meniscus cartilage. All the Nuggets can do is throw every training asset they have at him and hope it works out. ??? On the floor, Gallinari subsisted on high-degree-of-difficulty shots even though Denver mostly played him at power forward in smallish lineups, often with Kenneth Faried at center, designed to generate easier looks. Gallo would grind the offense to a halt, survey the scene, and jack brutal jumpers off dribbles and jab steps.   The positive spin: Gallo is a cold-blooded shot-maker, and he can nail shots few should consider. Imagine what he could do once Mike Malone, the team’s new coach, has time to (hopefully) install a half-court offense that flows for the full shot clock. The negative spin: What if Gallo just enjoyed a random extended hot streak after years of weirdly inconsistent jump-shooting? Gallinari couldn’t jet around Derrick Favors in that second clip, and if he can’t blow by opposing power forwards, his value as a playmaking 4 tops out early. Can anyone rely on shots like these?   Holy hell. But both of those toughies highlight the rare versatility that makes Gallinari valuable. He can act as both ball handler and screener in the pick-and-roll, unlocking so many combinations that defenses can never know quite what to expect when Gallo is at full Energizer Bunny activity levels. He can screen for his point guard, pop out for a potential 3-pointer, and, if that’s covered, shift right into a power forward-center pick-and-roll with Faried or Jusuf Nurkic. Opponents default into switches just to keep up, and Gallo can punish switches in either direction. Slot a little guy like Eric Gordon onto him, and Gallo goes into his Dirk impression: post up at the middle of the foul line and conduct office hours. Give a big lug the job, and Gallo will pull the ball out for a footrace. When he’s feeling frisky against an opposing center, Gallo has a delightful habit of backtracking all the way to midcourt, like a track star gearing up for the triple-jump. If those centers retreat just one extra step, bracing themselves for a drive, Gallo will pull up for audacious F-U 3s in their grill. At his best, Gallo opens up cracks in a defense. If two defenders hesitate for even a split second in switching against him on a pick-and-roll, a lane will emerge — either for Gallo or for his partner on the play. If he screens and pops for a triple, he’s dangerous enough to draw a third defender up from the corner:  If he whips that pass to Wilson Chandler open in the left corner, the Nuggets will be in the midst of one of those ping-ping-ping pass-and-drive sequences that make the Warriors and Spurs so hard to guard. Gallo in those moments last season leaned too much toward stopping the offense and going one-on-one — usually for long jumpers. He made a bunch, but Gallinari buries his all-around skill playing that way. He’s a crafty driver, all shoulder twitches and expert footwork, and a smart passer who slips the ball through tight spaces. “He can become a little over-reliant on his jumper,” Karl says. “But he can handle, and he makes good decisions. That’s where the league is going. It used to be about executing plays. Now it’s about passing and spacing, and putting smart players in positions where they can make quick decisions. Gallo can do that.” In other words: Gallo should be perfect for the pace-and-space era! Post-injury, Gallinari didn’t get to the rim or the foul line as often as he did at his pre-injury best, but perhaps that will change as he feels more confident in his knee. He drove to the rim much less often during the second and fourth quarters, per SportVU data provided to Grantland, but he showed the old herky-jerky explosiveness early in his shifts:  The Nuggets also have to see how Gallinari manages playing more on the wing, and with a rookie, Emmanuel Mudiay, playing in Lawson’s spot. Lawson wore out his welcome, but he’s a zippy playmaker who single-handedly created open 3s for Gallo and others. He pushed the pace, streaked by opposing point guards, and threw crazy Rondo-style wrap-around slingshots from under the rim all the way out to the top of the arc. Gallo munched on a bunch of easy spot-up 3s just by standing around, waiting for Lawson to make a play:  Faried is the only traditional big man in that photo, and you can see how open the floor was when Denver played that small style — with Gallinari as the nominal power forward. It was also a way for Denver to get its three highest-paid players — Faried, Gallinari, and Chandler — on the floor at the same time, an awkward contortion act that involves either playing Faried at center or Chandler at shooting guard in super-big lineups. Denver will have trouble finding time for small ball if all of its bigs are healthy. All five of Nurkic, Nikola Jokic, King Joffrey Lauvergne, J.J. Hickson (merely typing his name makes me throw up in my mouth a little), and Darrell Arthur will compete for minutes around Faried. Maybe playing big is healthy for Denver in the long run, anyway. Smaller groups with Faried and Gallinari manning the two “big” spots will struggle on defense and on the glass. Opponents feasted when posting up Gallinari last season, per Synergy Sports, and Gallinari inflames the problem by gambling for reach-around steals that just aren’t going to happen:  If Dirkenstein can spin around that lurch, almost any big man can pull the trick. At the other extreme, Gallo can get ultra-physical, leaning his chest into an opponent’s back with such force that cagey post-up guys use Gallinari’s momentum against him — a sort of inverted “pull out the chair” maneuver:  Gallinari can be a stout post defender when he keeps things simple and maintains better balance. He’s strong, he tries hard, and he raises his arms high to challenge shots. Big guys can push him around a bit, but smart teams will live with so-so post players flicking 8-foot hook shots over a good arms-up challenge. Still: Becoming a real team again means finding the right balance between offense and defense, and it seems inevitable that small-ball lineups will hemorrhage too many points. Denver may not have enough perimeter talent to play small, with Mudiay learning the ropes and Randy Foye, Will Barton, and Gary Harris3 splitting time at shooting guard. But damn if those groups aren’t dynamic in ways that cause real issues — with Faried pogoing down the lane sucking in defenders, and enough pick-and-roll duos to confuse any defense. They also don’t suffer spacing issues like this:  Good luck creating anything when defenses can clog the lane off of both Nurkic and Faried. Jokic and Lauvergne have more perimeter-oriented games that would make them interesting front-line partners for one of the Faried/Nurkic battering rams. Maybe one of Denver’s centers emerges in a year or two as the kind of expert rim protector who makes sliding Gallinari to power forward palatable. Nurkic looked more agile defensively as a rookie than most scouts expected. But Gallinari’s positional flexibility is a strength, not a weakness. He should toggle between both positions for any team, depending on roster context, coaching strategy, and specific opponents. Memphis sniffed around Gallinari at the trade deadline, per several league sources, and would have used him just as it did Jeff Green: as its starting small forward, playing heavy minutes at power forward in bench lineups and situations that called for it. Teams with starting frontcourts less accomplished than the Grizzlies’ brothers-from-another-mother, Zach Randolph and Marc Gasol, might tilt the equation toward more minutes for Gallinari at power forward. Denver discussed deals for Chandler, Gallinari, and Lawson ahead of the trade deadline, and it absolutely could have snagged future first-round picks for the first two, according to sources around the league. The Lawson trade market was trickier; Denver asked for two first-round picks in some talks, sources say, and it could not have known at that time quite how toxic Lawson would become just a few months later. But there is an alternative universe in which Denver flips all three and enters the 2015-16 season with a half-dozen extra first-round picks and a real chance to finish last in the West — a legitimate rebuild. The Nuggets instead traded one of the extra first-rounders they already had, an Oklahoma City 2016 pick likely to fall below no. 20, to dump JaVale McGee on the Sixers — and open up the sliver of cap space they needed to extend Chandler. The Lawson trade with Houston freed a new chunk of space, and the Nuggets used it to ink a two-year extension with Gallinari. Those were smart, forward-thinking moves that kept two good players out of what will be an overheated 2016 free-agency market. They also set Denver up with enough good players to win 30 or more games and land in that sour spot late in the lottery where no one wants to be. Gallinari and Chandler aren’t old, but at 27 and 28, respectively, they will almost certainly be past their primes — and perhaps on another team — by the time Mudiay and Nurkic are ready to win big. Does Chandler move the needle enough to justify a bad team sacrificing a first-rounder — even one in a spot that typically nets a fringe player? GM Tim Connelly says the Nuggets already have enough future picks, and that they felt comfortable dealing one — and punting on gathering others — to extend two players in their primes. They have extra first-rounders from Houston, Memphis, and Portland, plus the right to swap picks with New York in the next draft. Teams with too many picks literally can’t use them all given limits on roster size, and the Nuggets know that picks outside the lottery are hit-or-miss. “Given the future picks we already had, we weren’t inclined to sell off good players,” Connelly says. The Nuggets feel they have the picks, talent, and cap flexibility to strike if a star becomes available. “We have both financial and personnel flexibility,” Connelly says, “which should allow us to be aggressive and opportunistic.” But if Denver and New York are close in the standings, the right to swap picks the Nuggets got in the Carmelo trade won’t mean much. The first-rounder from Portland only goes to Denver if the Blazers make the playoffs in either 2016 or 2017; if Portland misses out in both years, which seems likely, that pick becomes a low second-rounder. Denver is already out second-rounders in the next two drafts, and if the Nuggets don’t improve, the second-rounder they owe Houston in 2017 might end up only a few spots lower than the first-rounder Houston will fling to Denver next year as part of the Lawson deal. In other words: Denver’s cache of picks might be what Cher from Clueless would call a Monet. The Nuggets don’t have quite the stockpile of Boston, Phoenix, or Philly. And Denver’s cap room won’t be worth much in a world where just about everyone has it. It’s a cliché, but it’s also true: Moving up from the middle is hard. You have to be almost perfect, and lucky. It’s why this situation feels a little more hopeless than it should, given the talent already here. Gallinari’s return to form provides a welcome bit of hope. You can understand why the Nuggets kept him. The Kroenke family, which owns the team, has never had the stomach for a teardown. Gallinari loves Denver, and that means something to a franchise that watched its keystone superstar hold it hostage four years ago. “We place a premium on guys who want to be here,” Connelly says. And Connelly, colleagues say, lives to kick ass at the draft. In six months, it might be clear that both Mudiay and Nurkic should have been top-five picks, and most rebuilding teams would salivate at that two-man foundation. Nail half of their first-rounders over the next two or three years, and the Nuggets could be the next Jazz. Utah had the benefit of two blue-chip no. 3 picks, Derrick Favors and Enes Kanter, but if something breaks wrong for either Denver or New York, perhaps the Nuggets will get one more shot toward the top of the lottery. Both conferences look better at the bottom; it may not take as much bad luck for a so-so team to end up like the accidentally awful 2013-14 Bucks. Besides, Connelly is right that Gallinari and Chandler are in their primes, and it’s nice to have veteran leadership. They’re under good, movable contracts — just like almost everyone else on the team. The process hasn’t always been clean, and the cold math says Denver should have swallowed hard, made some painful trades, and gone full (Sam) Hinkie. But not every front office has the leeway to do that, and in Mudiay and Nurkic, perhaps Denver already has the sort of players Hinkie’s plan in Philadelphia is designed to catch. Maybe they’ll catch some more. The odds of Denver transforming into a title team over the next half-decade are super slim, just as they are for any team without a superstar. But it’s nice to have things to feel good about. Gallo being Gallo is something to feel good about.",2015-09-22T09:36:03+00:00,NBA,Lowe
107,The Adjustment Bureau: How LaMarcus Aldridge Will Fit in With the Spurs,"The Spurs have heard the fretting about LaMarcus Aldridge — how he holds the ball longer than any Spur is permitted to, hogs Tim Duncan’s territory on the left block, and cares in rather un-Spursy fashion about how many shots and points he averages. The Spurs got over all of that long ago. They are itching to start the mutual adaptation process. Aldridge might not be the best fit for San Antonio’s whirring equal-opportunity system, but the perfect free agent isn’t always there the rare summer you have the cap room to lift Duncan’s championship window. Sometimes, you have to nab the star who’s both available and interested, and deal with the nitty-gritty stuff later. “LaMarcus will be different,” says R.C. Buford, the team’s GM. “And we’ll be different than we were before LaMarcus. We have to figure out how LaMarcus will play within our group, and produce at levels that he’s capable of — and that are important to him, and to our success.” Aldridge introduces some granular X’s-and-O’s complications, but don’t overthink this. He’s going to fit in fine, and the Spurs with Aldridge have a chance to be spectacular. They sacrificed the shared knowledge of roster continuity to get him, but it’s worth the risk — for this one season, and beyond. They need the simple accessibility of his post game, especially as the clock winds down, and a big man who can counter small-ball lineups — at both ends of the floor. Aldridge needs San Antonio to nudge him away from selfish tendencies and toward a new level of all-around greatness. If the Spurs fall short of expectations, it will probably be because of some other variable — age, injury, the continued decline of Tony Parker, or the brutal Western Conference landscape. It will take some sacrifice, but everyone involved is smart enough and flexible enough to make this work. I mean, these are the Spurs! Gregg Popovich has already reinvented them at least twice over, and their team-first ethos, from Duncan on down the roster, gets all kinds of personalities pulling in the same direction. “If anyone deserves the benefit of the doubt, it’s Pop,” says Warriors coach Steve Kerr, whose super-small lineups were very much on San Antonio’s mind as it chased Aldridge. “Nobody is more capable of adapting to a new group.” A big man who can shoot is perhaps the easiest sort of player to integrate on offense, and Aldridge is damn near Nowitzkian from midrange. It’s harder for that kind of player to hog the ball, simply because he needs someone to pass it to him first. By the time he gets it, the offense is already flowing. “When he shoots, the rim just looks really, really big,” says Chip Engelland, the Spurs assistant coach and famous shot doctor. When the Spurs needed extra spacing in the playoffs, they benched Tiago Splitter. Now they have Aldridge starting in Splitter’s spot. Aldridge has earned his reputation as a post-up glutton, but don’t typecast him. He’s also comfortable buzzing around the elbows, where San Antonio’s big men live. Only 10 players recorded more touches at the elbows than Aldridge last season, per SportVU data provided to Grantland, and the threat of his jumper means defenses have to pressure him when he has the ball there. That leaves open space for cutters, and you can envision Aldridge working handoffs, picking out Parker slithering along the baseline, and forming sublime high-low partnerships with Duncan, Boris Diaw, and David West. Kawhi Leonard is already a mean post-up player; he could be even meaner with Aldridge sucking one opposing big man far from the paint. Aldridge can spot up around Duncan-centric action, and when he’s dialed in, he can hit the bang-bang reads that make the Spurs offense go:  The Spurs will work to leverage the threat of Aldridge’s jumper as efficiently as possible, and that will mean a slight change in his diet of shots. He’ll still get to post up a ton, but the Spurs won’t walk it up, dump him the ball, and wait five seconds as Aldridge backs down into a turnaround jumper. “Shots taken off ball movement are more efficient than shots taken off ball stoppage,” Buford says. “That’s irrefutable. And it’s by enough of a margin that I don’t think it’ll be hard for Pop to say, ‘Move the ball.’” Aldridge shot 51 percent when he held the ball for less than two seconds before jacking, and 42 percent when he kept the ball any longer, per NBA.com. The Spurs know that math. Aldridge will still get to post up. The Spurs will even let him grind the offense to a halt against mismatches — and when Aldridge helms bench-heavy units without as many scoring options. Even in this era of pass-happy Spursgasms, Popovich allows Duncan, Diaw, and Leonard to clear out and draw double-teams against friendly matchups. Any team hoping to gut through four playoff series needs to shape-shift, and the Spurs are consciously building one sort of team that can beat the crap out of any smallish group — like, say, the Warriors with Draymond Green at center — on the block. But Aldridge will have to recalibrate how he gets his shots, and he has the hoops IQ to do that within a Spurs system that organically produces quick-hitting post-ups. Imagine him in Diaw’s spot here:  Boom! Sprint around a back screen from Leonard and slide into tasty post-up position as other Spurs fly around the weak side — occupying help defenders, and opening up passing options. Plop him into Duncan’s role in this classic bit of Spurs early offense that turns into a deep post-up:  Aldridge got hundreds of reps on that exact action in Portland, only he takes it places Duncan can’t:  Fade out another step or two and that’s a corner 3 — a shot Aldridge should take more in San Antonio, including on scripted out-of-timeout plays. He has the tools to pull off either end of this pick-and-roll for Diaw that morphs instantly into a post-up for Duncan:1  A play that gorgeous requires a ton of collective smarts, chemistry, and unselfishness nurtured over time, and it’s the exact kind of play that inspires minor fretting about Aldridge’s fit. Four Spurs touch the ball in a span of four seconds; lots of Aldridge’s post-ups in Portland dragged on longer. The action spits Duncan out on the right block, and Aldridge has never shown the ability to post up in an instant wherever the offense puts him. Over 90 percent of his post-ups came on the left side of the floor, making Aldridge the most lopsided post-up player in the league last season, per Synergy Sports. “The way they play, just kind of playing out of principles, you don’t get to pick your block,” says Jeff Van Gundy. Skilled players adapt; Duncan gradually developed into a threat from both blocks, and Aldridge may have to expand his comfort zone. The Spurs might tinker so that even unscripted elements of their offense lean left for Aldridge. This is all doable. That play doesn’t happen without Diaw rolling hard toward the rim, sucking Duncan’s defender toward him, and the Spurs might be plumb out of big men who enjoy the dirty work of jetting into a thicket of bodies near the basket. That may be a larger concern internally than Aldridge’s chucking. Splitter excelled at diving, in part because he had to. It was the only way he could draw defenders into his orbit. Even when Splitter didn’t touch the ball, opponents had to send help toward him at the basket, and that loosened space for San Antonio to unleash drive-and-kick hell. Aldridge, Diaw, and West all prefer to pop out after setting picks — Aldridge and West for jumpers, and Diaw for those delightful jiggling attacks when he catches the ball at the 3-point arc, fakes three different ways at once, and dribbles in for some crafty one-handed hook. Duncan’s roll is lumbering — too slow to scare defenses every time. Boban Marjanovic, the Spurs’ giant new movie villain, loves slicing to the hoop, but no one is sure if he’ll play meaningful minutes. “We don’t have as good rollers anymore,” Buford says. “That’s gonna be different for us.” Extra shooting solves a lot of these problems. Trap Parker or Manu Ginobili off a simple high pick-and-roll with Aldridge, and something will open up — a midranger for Aldridge, or the uncontested 3s Aldridge creates with his gravitational pull on help defenders:  If Aldridge’s defender hugs him so that he never gets open, Parker and Ginobili will have free paths to the basket. That is death. Switch the play, and Aldridge can bulldoze some poor little guard down to the block. That simplicity is nice to have in the bag. The Spurs’ side-to-side offense is beautiful, but it’s also exhausting. They built a deep bench to account for both age and the toll that offense can take. With Aldridge onboard, they can ditch the mad scramble for a possession or two and just run a two-man action in the middle of the floor. For Popovich to embrace that, Aldridge will have to make better choices with the ball. He slipped into the bad habit last season of looking off wide-open shooters, pausing, and then hoisting up a contested midranger right as his defender recovered:  His assist rate dropped, and he gobbled up a larger share of Portland possessions than ever before — and a much larger chunk than any individual Spur gets to use.  Aldridge has a good pump-and-drive game to trick defenders rushing out at him, but when he comes across a guy who can keep up, he settles for brutal pull-ups and step-backs:  Popovich won’t tolerate that stuff early in the shot clock. None of this is rocket science. We’re talking about Aldridge bagging two greedy midrange jumpers a night, swinging the ball, and maybe even getting it back later in the possession. He’s a smart passer when he wants to be. He also knows he can’t just drift out for jumpers after every pick; he’ll mix in hard slips to the hoop when his defender lunges out hard at the ball-handler:  Unpredictability is important, and all of these popping big guys get that. If they all cut hard to the rim now and then, they can collectively make up for Splitter’s absence. This is just basketball. Aldridge isn’t even the most important part of the equation; Parker is. Defenses will try to defang the whole attack by ducking under screens against Parker, and if he can’t punish them with jumpers, floaters, and full-speed-ahead drives into traffic, the Spurs will have to battle to get some traction. “When it’s all pick-and-pop, you’re gonna have a hard time collapsing the defense unless Parker is living in the paint,” Van Gundy says. “Everyone talks about LaMarcus, and then Duncan and Ginobili getting older, but that’s what I’m most interested in: how healthy Parker is, and how well he plays.” Patty Mills outplayed Parker for stretches of last season, but he’s not quite the kind of relentless drive-and-kick slicer that can keep an entire offense humming. Even if Parker can’t regain All-Star form, Aldridge’s shooting alone should be a boon for the Spurs — after an initial adjustment period. The fit should be even smoother on defense, where Aldridge has long been underrated. When he’s engaged, Aldridge can lock down multiple positions and cover a ton of ground with top-notch footwork. He’s fast enough to lunge out at a point guard on the pick-and-roll, stop on a dime, and sprint back to his guy before that player can uncork a triple:  He stays balanced against pump fakes, and he’s an expert at switching onto little guys who pull the ball out and try to go one-on-one against him:  When guards get a half-step on him, Aldridge is long enough to bother them from behind. Point guards who drive against him arrive at the rim, feel Aldridge on their hip, and loft layups a few inches higher than they’d like in order to squeeze them over Aldridge’s outstretched arms. Those shots usually hit the glass and bounce off the front of the rim. Stretch power forwards haven’t been able to get by him off the bounce:  This is what makes Aldridge a small-ball antidote, and the Spurs had Golden State on the brain when they signed him. The dream response to small ball is simple: stay big without compromising your defense, and then destroy the small-ball team in the post and on the offensive glass. The Spurs can use Aldridge with any of their big men, especially Duncan, against small-ball opponents that keep one traditional big on the floor. Aldridge can hang with almost any wing player masquerading as a power forward,2 and Duncan can guard that solitary big fella. Go super-small, and the Spurs can now yank Duncan without sacrificing size and post-up ability. Aldridge makes noise about not wanting to play center, but he’ll have to do it in all kinds of lineups — including smaller groups with Leonard at power forward. He’ll serve as the nominal center alongside Diaw or West in bench lineups, but both of those guys can spend time guarding post-up behemoths so Aldridge doesn’t have to. Aldridge is a so-so rim protector, and much has been made about how the Spurs are running low on rim deterrence with Splitter and Aron Baynes gone. Probably too much, really. Aldridge and Splitter are the same height, and Splitter isn’t exactly a leaper; opponents shot better at the basket when Splitter was nearby last season than against Portland with Aldridge at the bucket, per SportVU data. Aldridge isn’t a shot-blocker, and he would go through stretches of lazy, ground-bound swiping around the rim in Portland. He does not take charges. But he can do better when he cares, and when he’s not paranoid about foul trouble. Baynes turned himself into a real rotation player, but is anyone really worried the loss of Aron freaking Baynes is going to cost San Antonio real championship equity? Come on. Aldridge is 30, and as he gets older, he’ll lose a bit of the speed that makes him an anti-small-ball weapon. Smart teams can already hurt Aldridge after switches by cycling him back into a pick-and-roll or nailing him with screens away from the ball. But everyone struggles with that stuff, and Aldridge becomes more alert once you burn him. Aldridge isn’t an All-Defense-level guy, but he’s fine. He can play one kind of role for this specific Spurs team, perhaps the last of the Duncan era, and transition into another kind of role toward the back end of his four-year contract. “There will be a time when Pop, Tony, Timmy, and Manu are all gone,” Buford says, chuckling, “and we might want LaMarcus to hold the ball for 20 seconds.”",2015-09-15T08:47:08+00:00,NBA,Lowe
108,The Curious Case of Markieff Morris,"Markieff Morris in his present form isn’t worth all of this fuss. Power forward is loaded leaguewide, and even teams that could use a boost there aren’t sure Morris is a pure talent upgrade over their incumbents — and that’s before getting into felony charges, trade demands, fines, technicals, and general Morrii yapping. Morris is unremarkable, and at 26, the odds are he stays unremarkable. He is now more like an average starting NBA power forward, and his first season in that role was a mild disappointment. Morris didn’t improve at anything, and he got worse at one big thing: getting to the foul line. That puts the Suns in a tough spot. Morris has been unhappy in Phoenix since the Suns dumped his brother on Detroit, but no other team is clamoring to get him. That creates an opportunity for some smart team to leap into the bidding, take a shot on Morris at a slight discount, and see if it can unlock his potential as something more than a run-of-the-mill big man — all while taking on Year 1 of what could be an absurd contract. Phoenix doesn’t seem especially motivated to deal Morris now, per several league sources, and Jeff Hornacek, the team’s head coach, told local reporters on Tuesday he’s hopeful Morris and the franchise can reconcile. It’s not dumping him for dead money and a second-round pick. It’s also hard to make trades before December 15, when free agents who signed this summer become trade-eligible. But teams should be looking at Morris and talking about what he could become. Lots of power forwards can do two of these three things on offense: post up (particularly against switches and small-ball mismatches), shoot 3s, and make productive passes off the dribble. Very few can do all three, and those who can are lethal. They can play in any lineup and help against any opponent. Morris can already post and pass (“He’s an excellent passer,” Hornacek says), and he hit 31.8 percent from deep last season — just 3 percentage points below the league average. That’s not good enough to scare defenses, and the Suns hoped Morris would have made more progress by now. “We thought he’d be a little better,” Hornacek says. “If he’s right around 30 percent, that’s probably not conducive to him shooting a lot of 3s.” Draymond Green shot 33.7 percent from deep, and he had free rein to jack five triples per 36 minutes. He even faced criticism for getting gun-shy in the Finals, when the Cavs invited him to fire away. Morris shoots 31.8 percent, and he’s a disappointment who regularly passes up wide-open 3s. Green and Morris are nothing alike on defense, of course. Green breathes fire, and Morris too often uses defense as a chance to catch his breath. “Some games he brings it, some games he doesn’t,” Hornacek says. “Maybe it’s conditioning. Maybe it’s him saying, ‘If I put the effort in on defense, then I can’t do it on the offensive end.’” Morris hasn’t shown he can switch in either size direction on defense. He’s three inches taller than Green, but his wingspan is actually shorter, and he doesn’t have the low center of gravity that allows Green to hold his ground when huge dudes back him down. The Suns have rarely asked Morris to switch onto smaller ball handlers on the pick-and-roll, and he has looked out of sorts the few times he’s tried it. But Morris has the raw speed to pull that off, and the Suns are going to experiment with more switching this season. “We’ll use more of that this year,” Hornacek says. “He can do it. If the game’s on the line, I think he’ll be great at it. He focuses on those kinds of plays. The question is whether he can do it in the middle of games, consistently.” Morris could transform himself into a really good player for the modern, pace-and-space, switch-everything NBA, and he’s just starting a four-year, $32 million contract. In a league where contracts are short and starters will soon be earning almost $15 million on average, that deal is like gold bullion. There is not much risk in trumping a tepid trade market to take a shot on Morris. We all know the obvious suspects by now. Toronto and Boston have so-so starting power forwards and extra picks, but I’m not sure either sees Morris as an upgrade. And not even Boston, hoarding so many picks in every draft range, is coughing up a first-rounder for Morris right now. Detroit has Marcus Morris and a decent power forward in Ersan Ilyasova whose salary matches Markieff Morris’s almost exactly. (Perhaps the Pistons agree with Phoenix that the twins may be better off separated.) The Lakers need help everywhere, the Hornets have an easy trade package in Cody Zeller and Jeremy Lamb, and the Blazers have the cap space to absorb Morris without trading anyone. They also have a zillion other young bigs who need minutes, and there are potential fit issues in some of those other places. Morris is interesting enough that teams off the beaten path should at least have some internal discussions about him. If I were Nuggets GM Tim Connelly, I’d be tempted to pick up the phone and ask Ryan McDonough, the Suns GM, about a straight Kenneth Faried/Markieff Morris swap. Poll 100 league executives, and I suspect at least a slight majority would say Faried is the better player now. Numbers of all types certainly agree, and Faried isn’t carrying the same kind of baggage. But we know what Faried is, and what he’ll almost certainly never be good at: outside shooting. He’ll also make about $4 million more per season than Morris over the next four years. That gap won’t matter quite as much during the likely cap boom, but every dollar saved in one spot might come in handy elsewhere. That cost certainty might mean a lot to Houston, which could have two power forwards — Terrence Jones and Donatas Motiejunas — hit restricted free agency next summer amid a flood of cap money. Houston has some salary-matching contracts that become tradable on December 15, and if the Rockets think one of the Jones/Motiejunas pairing is likely to walk, they could easily work a deal with Phoenix. The Suns would get matching rights to one of those guys, and the Rockets would snag a cheap starting-caliber power forward who would start bombing from deep in their system. (They’d also get another tricky personality, and they’re pretty well-stocked with those. Their MVP candidate is damn near a Kardashian. Daryl Morey should hire private detectives to plant evidence suggesting whichever Kardashian cheated on James Harden, just so Harden dumps her.) If the Pelicans are afraid of losing Ryan Anderson, why not check in about a deal centered on an Anderson/Morris swap? Morris can’t shoot like Anderson, but he’s better at other stuff, and his health record is much cleaner. Indiana probably doesn’t want another “problem” personality, and the Pacers don’t have much beyond a lowball offer without attaching a first-rounder. Morris would open up the floor a bit in Washington. He’d eat into the Wizards’ Kevin Durant cap room, but they could move him in a pinch after the season. The Kings and Knicks should take a look, even though neither has movable assets that would interest Phoenix — unless the Knicks are ready to engage in Carmelo Anthony trade talks. (They’re not there, yet. But they’re getting closer.) Hell, don’t rule out Philly swooping in with two second-rounders, playing Morris enough to rehabilitate his trade value, and then flipping him at the deadline for a future first-rounder. Morris is worth at least some creative thinking. He’s an accomplished post-up player from both blocks, capable of making pressured midrange jumpers:  That shot has helped Morris, especially in crunch time, but it’s not the sort of shot that makes his post game interesting. It’s a fadeaway over an all-time great post defender in Tim Duncan, and Morris stalls the Suns offense to set it up. Against big guys with the speed to track Morris’s twitchy fakes, those shots just as often end up looking like this:  And they rarely create contact. “He doesn’t draw enough fouls,” Hornacek says. Other Phoenix players have a bad habit of standing still while Morris surveys. That’s partly on those players and the coaching staff, but it’s also linked to where Morris likes to operate. He lives in that weird in-between space a step or two outside the paint, and that clutters up the most natural cutting lanes both inside and outside. “He doesn’t get the ball deep on the block, and sometimes there’s no place to cut,” Hornacek says. But in moderation, Morris’s post game can be a deadly weapon. Morris obliterates wing players who switch onto him. As I’ve written before, that’s the kind of play that will keep the post game alive — the ability to leverage size mismatches that present themselves when defenses switch. Slot a bigger defender on him, and Morris shifts into blow-by mode with baseline drives.  Morris has to be more choosy with his post-ups, go faster with the ball, and trade a few contested shots for passes — especially since he’s good enough to draw help defenders on the block. He has blips of selfishness in his game:  Morris overpowers Dorell Wright and starts to suck in help defenders before spinning baseline for a terrible jumper. Just drive and dish. Maybe the Suns should use Mission: Impossible technology to outfit all of their players in Marcus Morris masks, so that Markieff will pass to them. Morris is a helluva passer when he wants to be — from the post, and the perimeter. He anticipates how the chess pieces are about to move, and he makes instant reads:   When Morris picks-and-pops into 3-point range, defenses are going to leave him open. Ditto for when he spots up around a Tyson Chandler pick-and-roll. That’s not ideal, but it’s workable. Defenses leave Green open, too. Not everyone can be Anderson or Dirk Nowitzki. Morris just needs to shoot more 3s, hit 35 percent of them, and spend his other perimeter possessions punishing teams with his dribbling and passing. He should be able to gradually tilt his game in a more efficient direction. The bigger questions come on defense, where he just doesn’t play with enough care or urgency. He’s not always in sync communicating with his point guards on the pick-and-roll, resulting in blown coverages and wide-open driving lanes. He doesn’t amp up his effort as a help defender when the first line of defense springs a leak. This is Stephen Curry strolling into the lane, and Morris treats it like a practice possession:  He’s not good enough, or talented enough, to get away with so-so effort. He doesn’t have the height or leaping ability that make a natural rim protector, and unless his motor is really revving, he offers zippo resistance at the end line. If he makes one hard cut on defense, he’ll sometimes feel satisfied and check out as the rest of the play unfolds within arm’s reach. He plays defense with his hands down. Morris would make an interesting small-ball center in change-of-pace lineups, but the Suns haven’t trusted his defense and rebounding enough to use those groups in extended stretches that matter. Look, this stuff is hard. That’s the point. If Morris wants to become a Swiss Army knife on defense, stifling guys across multiple positions, it’s going to take a lot of grunt work — especially since he doesn’t yet appear comfortable guarding perimeter ball handlers. That’s a new, almost foreign skill for some big men, and Morris might never acquire it. I’m excited to see him try. If a team has the patience to chip away at all the Morris family nonsense, it might find a really interesting all-around player underneath it.",2015-09-10T09:32:15+00:00,NBA,Lowe
109,The Definitive NBA Logo Rankings,"It’s that time of the summer again. After going way too deep ranking names and court designs, we’re back to hit perhaps the most important piece of art associated with a team: its primary logo, which defines both its on-court look and marketing reach. Some rules: • This is subjective, though I’ve consulted experts who understand the process behind the images. • I’ve focused almost entirely on primary marks; things get unwieldy if you factor in the half-dozen secondary and partial logos that teams conjure to sell more stuff. That said, a killer secondary logo can nudge a team up the rankings — or make you wonder how they could hide it behind some dull central mark.    Like, what is this? Thunder higher-ups hoped fans would think of two things when they heard the name — storms and rampaging bison — but they didn’t want to commit visually in either direction. A stormy logo might marginalize the bison, a key symbol for local Native Americans, and the staid Thunder thought it would be silly to have mature adults wear jerseys with animals on them. “We didn’t feel like having professional players represented by [an] animal was where we wanted to be,” says Brian Byrnes, the team’s senior vice-president for sales and marketing. Besides, Byrnes says, “the bull was already taken.” Straddling the fence resulted in this vanilla mishmash. “It might be the best D-League logo ever made,” says Tom O’Grady, who served as the NBA’s first creative director before leaving to found Gameplan Creative, a Chicago-based branding consultancy. Team officials say the shield hints at a leader charging into battle, and that the upward rising “bolts,” which don’t look like bolts at all, symbolize a young franchise growing up. No team has worse art, top to bottom, and Nike will push for an overhaul once it replaces Adidas as the league’s apparel partner in 2017. Nike and the Thunder are already talking, and the Thunder “haven’t ruled out” a more explicit weather-related secondary mark, Byrnes says. Bad news: Oklahoma City seems locked into the shield motif and likely won’t replace it with a bison — or anything else. “To some extent, we are committed to the idea we have,” Byrnes says. “But we would not dismiss good feedback, particularly from Nike. We’re open to modernizing the logo, but we don’t have an appetite to overhaul it.” They already have plenty of nice bison illustrations, courtesy of Dick Sakahara, a California designer who consulted with the Thunder during the team’s creation. “I have a lot of bison that never got to be,” Sakahara says.  It takes about two years for teams to create new artwork, which means we’re probably at least a half-decade away from the Clippers scrapping this — and pretending it never happened. They tried some cool stuff with the monogram and the curved lines, meant to suggest undulating waves, but the only thing you notice is the giant CLIPPERS word in a color the team had never featured. “It just doesn’t work,” says Mark Fox, a Bay Area designer who has worked on several team logos over the last two decades. “What a missed opportunity to do something tasty,” Sakahara says.  The name is all churning Motor City dynamism, but the team tosses out a blinding red basketball with “Detroit Pistons” written across it. With so many energetic, car-related images available, how do you end up in the least inspired place? “The default NBA logo is a basketball with the name typed across it,” Fox says. “If you end up there, you aren’t working very hard.” © 1991 Mark Fox / BlackDogThe league contracted Fox to design a new Pistons logo in the 1990s, when they eventually settled on a flaming horse head perched above exhaust pipes. Fox drew a lug nut atop crisscrossing wrenches, meant to evoke a skull-and-crossbones flag, and placed them within a circular saw blade. I don’t love the jagged, arcade-style font, but this could have evolved into a badass logo. “I think it might have scared the league,” Fox says, laughing. An old version of the red ball carries some Bad Boys–era nostalgia, but I’d take the flaming horse or the original Fort Wayne Pistons robot man over the current version.  Simplicity plays better than noise, for purposes of both art and commerce. The NBA shrinks logos onto patches and tiny slices of real estate, and jumbled marks become indecipherable on a miniature scale. There is just too much going on here for a team that already has to fit 21 letters into this mark — too many trees, too many colors, and too much dramatic shading on the wolf’s face. The Clips and Pacers got away with not including their full city/state in their primary marks, and the Wolves should push to join them upon their inevitable redesign. The easiest solution: shift a revised version of their gorgeous secondary logo, featuring a wolf howling into the night sky, onto center stage.    New York is the greatest city in the world, and there is nothing New York about this logo. There are only vague allusions. The giant block letters, leaning a few degrees backward, are meant to mimic skyscrapers as seen from below. The triangular shield is a nod to the emblems Gotham superheroes wear upon their chests. Whatever. You could transfer the same combination of triangle, basketball, and font to any team.The logo wasn’t supposed to be this bland. The league hired Michael Doret, a noted lettering expert, to craft a majestic mark centered on the Empire State Building. Doret integrated the building seamlessly, so that it didn’t subsume the other elements of the logo. The sketches screamed New York without screaming. The Knicks retreated into mediocrity, in part because they ran into issues acquiring the rights to the building’s image. A team stealing money from the city via a massive tax break on Madison Square Garden should pay, within reason, for a logo that reflects its grandiose place in the NBA universe. “It was so close to being perfect,” O’Grady says. “It’s just boring,” Fox says. “And Doret’s work is never boring. If it is, that means something terrible has happened.” At least Doret’s subway token mark, with a stylized”NYK,” lives on as a secondary logo. That thing rocks.  The snow-capped mountain is subtle, and that’s the problem: You barely notice it behind the monstrous, balloony font spelling out “Nuggets.” The golden lettering nods at the team’s name and calls back to classic Old West signage. “You could see it hanging on a saloon,” Fox says. It’s just hard to get by the bubbly font, which also infects an otherwise pristine court design. The Nuggets have already shifted the superior pickax secondary logo into the precious center-court real estate, and they should just bump it into the top spot. It describes the origins of the name with more clarity than the blah mountainscape and without smacking you over the head like the coked-up Maxie the Miner cartoon Denver used in the 1970s.  You almost have to squint at this mess for 30 seconds, like one of those Magic Eye puzzles, to figure out what the hell is going on. There are swords,1 maybe some crown-like spikes at the top, and, wait, is there a shield in there someplace? It resembles a prop from a bad tiki bar. “It looks like you walked into someone’s kitchen, took out a big magnet, sucked all the pots and pans toward it, and then concluded, ‘There’s your logo,’” Fox says. The “K” and “S” in “Kings” are weirdly larger than the middle three letters. The purple-and-black combination is nice, and unique in the NBA,2 but there’s not quite enough black here. There is entirely too much gray. The Kings need something cleaner, and they have good starting points in the vault. Their current secondary logo, a purple crown, is pleasing, and the crown atop a yin-yanged “S” and “K” could lead them someplace special.  Points for trying something different, but the stylized horse within a basketball has never done it for me. It reminds me of a marble with swirling colors inside of it. Everything the Mavs do artistically — the jerseys, the logo, the court, the team name — leaves me unmoved. Three interlocking shapes making up one logo feels busy.  You understand the impulse to create a more artful version of Denver’s logo. The franchise knows how incongruent it is to have the Jazz in Utah, but it also understands how perfect the name is. The basketball-as-jazz metaphor is a cliché now, but it’s a cliché because there is truth at the heart of it. The Jazz split the difference by keeping the name but replacing any reference to actual jazz music with something representative of the region. League officials in the 1990s recommended working the classic Jazz note into the team’s new mountainy look, O’Grady says, but they just couldn’t mold the two disparate elements together. This is classic overthinking. The original Jazz logo, with the “J” rendered as a musical note and a tricolored basketball as the note head, is one of the greatest pieces of art in sports history. Just use that and demote the mountain nonsense to the background. Good news: Utah is on track for an official return to the note logo as its primary mark for the 2016-17 season. They might crack the top five here next time around.  Washington punted on the two-dimensional leaping wizard, but it’s politically difficult — maybe impossible — for them to revisit any of the beloved Bullets imagery. They’ve avoided both by marketing the team around Washington, D.C., itself, vaporizing any whiff of the wizard. The new primary logo, debuting this season, is an interesting start, but it wouldn’t surprise me if Washington modified it before 2020. The Wiz have squeezed in a bunch of cool local iconography, but all the stripes, stars,3 and monuments distract the eye from what should be a simple reading: There’s a basketball in the middle! Exquisite detailing on both the outside and inside of a circular logo may be too much, and I’m torn on the Washington Monument as a super-thick lace on the ball. Overall, the secondary “dc” logo is better: I’m not ashamed to admit that I kinda miss that levitating wizard guy. The Wiz excised him from all levels of the logo scheme, and that’s just cold — a cruel memory charm aimed at the minority of fans who enjoyed him.  The boring name and ugly color scheme make for rough parameters, but this is a solid result. The sword is threatening, and having the sharp end slice through the opening underneath the big “C” was smart. So was letting one team color — the wine shade — dominate the mark, instead of trying to mix two strong ones. It’s just hard to construct something beautiful from the Cavs’ underlying foundation. The logo can also look huge on the horizontal plane, since the sword juts out at either end, and the Cavs shoehorn in their complete 18-letter team name.  Here’s a challenge: create a visual representation for the concept of “magic,” incorporate basketball, and somehow avoid making it corny. The Magic have done that with the comet ball, which flies downward as if it were about to drop through the net. I’ve always liked that mark. The straight font, unveiled in 2010, is almost too serious to back such a joyful image. The old stylized font, which used stars for the “a” in Magic and the dot of the “i,” trod toward camp, but it made for a better fit with that starry ball.  I will never understand the Suns’ recent determination to be Team Halloween, pushing black over that classic purplish blue as the companion to orange. The sunburst should be a no-brainer top-10 mark, but the Suns have imprisoned it within a black jail cell. Either let that baby soar without boundaries, or go back to the purple-blue background that set the league on fire in the mid-1990s: “That mark literally changed the way logos were done,” O’Grady remembers. “You can see what they were trying to do with the update, but they’ve screwed it up.” Just having the words underneath the purple-blue block made that old mark feel less oppressive — like it could breathe a bit. The Suns must know what’s up on some level, because they’ve kept the blue as the basis for their secondary flaming-ball logo, which adorned center court for much of the Steve Nash era. That’s a better mark than the current sunburst, but it’s also similar to Miami’s primary logo.  The groundbreaking use of black-and-white sets a tone of minimalist cool, and the Nets doubled down by taking their old 3-D shield logo and flattening it into a smooth 2-D mark. But let’s not go crazy. This is basically a Thunder-style shield with a basketball inside it — one that almost resembles the negative image of an eight ball. The NBA’s worst team name doesn’t present a ton of options, so this is a nice first shot for the Brooklyn era. The Nets toyed around with other color schemes as they prepped for the Brooklyn move, and it will be interesting to see if they revisit any for future logos.  This is an underrated logo, especially considering the garish monstrosity it replaced. The “R,” crafted by Eiko Ishioka, an Academy Award–winning4 designer, has two pitch-perfect hints of rocketry: the nose cone atop the left brushstroke and the two streams of exhaust fuming from the bottom as the rocket takes off. That is subdued beauty. The Rockets took the “subdued” thing too far, with perhaps the league’s plainest court design and a basic red-and-white color scheme. They break out the old McDonald’s red-and-yellow look several times per season, and there seems to be a groundswell for a return to that early-1990s style. Houston decided to ditch that look around 1993, because the team’s owner, Leslie Alexander, thought it had become synonymous with losing, O’Grady remembers. Alexander wanted to start fresh and incorporate an actual rocket ship. And then, bam: Houston won back-to-back titles in their yellow-and-red duds, shattering their alleged connection with loserdom. The Rockets asked to reverse the branding change, but it was too late; the league sent them a seven-figure bill for all the merchandise they had already commissioned, and Houston relented, O’Grady says. And so the world met one of the most ridiculous logos in league history — a sneering rocket with a red tip on his nose: The original version wasn’t so cartoonish, but Alexander liked how the toothy glare recalled nose art on World War II–era bombers, O’Grady says. Houston used the logo as a springboard into insanity. They placed it in the middle of hideous pinstriped jerseys and depicted it flying across the most cacophonous court design in pro hoops history. Remarkably, the angry rocket was in lockstep with creative trends, O’Grady says. Teams envied the popularity of Charlotte’s dribbling hornet, Hugo, and rushed to draw their own goofy characters. This was the era of purple dinosaurs, flaming horses, muscle-bound blue warriors, and hockey’s mighty ducks. “Charlotte started it, and then the barn door was open,” O’Grady says. Sophisticated designers cautioned the league against over-illustrated marks. “Nike knocked us up and down Fifth Avenue about how cartoonish the logos were getting,” O’Grady says. “They were the anti-cartoon police.” Fox and other outside consultants joined the chorus, but team and league officials were hell-bent on duplicating the Hugo effect. The Rockets have since veered to the opposite pole, and perhaps they oversimplified. If they redo their art, I hope they find a spot for that “R.”  It’s impossible to untangle the quality of a piece of art from the emotional connections we build around it over time. We all love this logo, but we probably love it because it has been associated over five decades with some of the greatest teams in sports history. Unless you’re a raging Laker-hater, when you see this logo, some happy signal fires inside you. “The nostalgia of that mark is unquestionable,” says Rodney Richardson, owner of RARE Design in Mississippi, which has consulted with several NBA teams. “But if someone designed that today, would people say, ‘That’s a great logo’? I doubt it. Is it timeless because it’s timeless, or because it never changed?” It is just the team’s name superimposed on a basketball — the dull template teams fall back on when they can’t think of anything else. But the “forum blue” and gold color scheme is so soft and inviting, and the streaking letters give the impression of a team flying down the court — perfect for the Showtime era. The only adjustment the Lakers should even entertain would be adding the circle of 16 stars, one for each championship, that glitters around the logo at center court. This is a basic mark that has gathered greater significance for reasons beyond artistry. Slotting it in the middle feels right.  Everyone expected this to be a bust — even Richardson, the guy who designed it. “It was like, ‘Good grief, why would you ever name a team the Pelicans?'” Richardson says, laughing. “And we were told, ‘Well, that’s what Mr. [Tom] Benson wants.’” “When they announced they would be the Pelicans, every designer I knew said, ‘Oh my god, that is going to be hard to do,'” says Jason Lim, the Warriors’ director of creative services. Richardson made it work. The bird is immediately identifiable as a pelican, and the menacing stare and blood-red beak provide appropriate aggressiveness for an attacking NBA mascot. This is one of only two logos in which the city name is rendered in larger type than the team name, and Richardson drew “New Orleans” atop the wings to create the effect of a pelican — the symbol of the city’s survival after the Deepwater Horizon spill — lifting the city into a rebirth. “I was surprised and impressed,” Lim says. The fleur-de-lis atop the logo is a perfect capper, and the team was smart to choose locally relevant colors over a brighter Mardi Gras theme that might have resonated more with casual fans outside New Orleans. Everything in here sends the same message: This team belongs to the city. It’s just a little busy. Even the ball is two different colors. The logo collapses in on itself when you shrink it for patches. That’s where the secondary logos come in, Richardson says, and they are all great — especially the “bird-de-lis.”  The Pacers’ art is all no-frills, and that works in a state where the quiet choreography of the game has always been more important than the noise around it. The Pacers have the league’s smallest center-court logo, and this primary mark is so clean, it doesn’t even include the state’s name. It doesn’t have to. The ball flying over the word “Pacers” guides us to all the associations we’re supposed to make — speed, pace cars, the Indy 500, and the state of Indiana. It’s nothing spectacular, but it fits the franchise.  Design experts would rank this one much higher, and using a spur for the “u” in the team’s name is effortless genius. They tilted that spur “u” a few degrees upright after scrapping the famous fiesta logo, where it was slanted almost horizontally — a jarring look that didn’t quite mesh with the rest of the word. I like the way that new spur drops below the word mark, and its starry outline pops against a white background. Silver and black is objectively cool, and though the fiesta look is much-loved among some fans, it was too loud for me. Rectangular logos can get distended on the longer plane, and this mark vacuumed up a ton of real estate on the Spurs’ old court. San Antonio has centered more of its marketing on the stand-alone spur logo, and it wouldn’t shock anyone at the league office if they eventually used a version of it as their primary mark.  We’re into elite territory now. Sakahara’s hawk clutching a basketball was the best of the mid-1990s cartoon boom, probably because it was the least cartoony of that bunch. But it will be gone next season, after a pile of research pointed to the obvious: Fans just love the Pac-Man. “We had just become so disconnected from fans, emotionally,” says Peter Sorckoff, the team’s chief creative officer. “It had a great run,” Sakahara says of his old hawk. The league prohibits reusing “legacy marks” as primary logos, since that would cannibalize a separate revenue stream for vintage goods, so the Hawks had the thorny task of updating a beloved logo so subtly no one would notice. “I was terrified to screw up the original logo,” Sorckoff says. “If we did this wrong, I’d never get over it personally, let alone what it would have done to my career.” They sharpened the beak, added a little cleft around its chin, and tilted its head downward, so that the bird looks like it’s swooping down on prey. “We did this thinking about Bud’s [Mike Budenholzer’s] style of play, and he’s all about attack, attack, attack,” Sorckoff says. Budenholzer had some degree of say-so on the biggest change: the “Atlanta Hawks Basketball Club” ringing the hawk. The team was concerned about aping European soccer, but Budenholzer liked the idea that the franchise was larger than any particular group of players. Higher-ups also wanted an inclusive message after a racism scandal engulfed both ownership and the front office one year ago. “What we went through last September was horrible,” Sorckoff says. “The meaning really is that anyone can join this club. Just raise your hand and say, ‘I dig the Hawks.’” Designers played around with grays and the team’s new “Volt Green,” but team officials decided the primary mark should only feature red and white — now and forever. The team can use the new colors in other spots, and Sorckoff says they plan to produce merchandise soon with some Native American–themed art linked to the team’s original iteration as the Tri-Cities Blackhawks.  Design experts scoff at this, but I don’t really care: blue and yellow make gorgeous love in the middle, and slotting the silhouette of the Bay Bridge off-center gives the logo — and the Golden State jerseys — a quirky style no one else has. That was an accident. The team experimented with marks closer to the famous “City” logo, and with straight-on views that mimicked what drivers see as they get on the bridge. But the Warriors wanted to slap the logo onto the front of the jersey, and Adidas reminded them that they needed space for numbers. Moving the bridge left cleared that space, though the numbers are technically smaller than league-mandated standards. This is a nice, understated move away from the blue warrior dude, especially since Golden State had only a year to redesign all of its art. The mascot version of the blue warrior was called Thunder, and when Oklahoma City’s owners swiped that name, the Warriors had limited time for a makeover. Unfortunately, you can’t really tell it’s the Bay Bridge, and people often mistakenly assume it’s the more famous Golden Gate, Lim says. Even TV production teams have produced animations in which the Golden Gate fades into an image of the logo. The font is also a universally available standard called Copperplate, and using a public font is a mark of shame among designers. The league blames the Warriors, and the Warriors blame the league. “I wish we had pushed back more,” Lim says. The off-center look might violate some design principles, since it draws your eye toward the empty blue space, but something about it hits. “It’s charming in that it almost feels a bit varsity — like college ball,” says Tom Koukodimos, a partner at Sid Lee, a leading design firm. “I’d hate to lose that. Everyone is trying for something unique, and the Warriors have that.”  The best of the “words over ball” genre, and proof that starting with an evocative name — no. 2 on my name rankings — can transform a ho-hum logo scheme into something greater. The name offers up all kinds of historical details, including the ring of 13 stars, one for each of the original colonies, that has almost always been a key part of Philly’s art. The small white “Philadelphia” within a blue circle, a new feature, has a throwback feel that meshes with Philly’s traditional marks. The juxtaposition of the maroon “7” and blue “6” has always worked, in part because neither shade is too loud. And, holy cow, welcome Dribblin’ Ben Franklin into the secondary-logo universe! Who cares if there is debate about whether Franklin was actually left-handed? If Ben freaking Franklin set his mind to dribbling with his weak hand, he’d have mastered it.  Prediction: This logo ages well after a rocky start. Some fans miss the dinosaur, and the Raptors first leaked a black-and-white version that had the lunatic fringe of Brooklyn fans accusing Toronto of stealing its motif. “If they think that, hopefully it fans the flames of our rivalry,” says David Freeman, the head of brand marketing at Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment. Toronto has focused its new image around “We The North,” a slogan that captures the feeling of being outcasts in a league where every other team plays in the U.S. “It’s our way of embracing everything people say is crappy about us,” Freeman says. “That it’s cold here, that you need your passport, all of it.” You could argue this is just another name-on-ball job, but I love the integration of the Raptor claw into the lacing of the ball — a touch that suggests the damage a dinosaur can do without actually showing the dinosaur. Aren’t movie monsters scarier offscreen? “Most teams with animal names just illustrate what the team is,” says Koukodimos, who helped design the logo. “We wanted to break from that.” Outsiders need to be different, after all. The Raptor name fits that image, and the team plans to keep it in perpetuity, despite regular cries to switch to Huskies — or something else, Freeman says. Husky dogs are everywhere; almost no one else uses a dinosaur mascot. The Raptors will produce a new Husky uniform for 2016 to honor the 70th anniversary of the Toronto Huskies from the defunct Basketball Association of America, but that’s as far as they plan to go, Freeman says. There are also some new secondary marks coming. This logo is a nifty way to keep the Raptor name while distancing the team from Jurassic Park, the 1993 film that inspired the mascot. “There is a generation of people who loved that film,” Koukodimos says. “And then there are people who say, ‘Why the heck are we named after a freaking movie from 1993?’”  Long live the pinwheel, one of the few purely abstract logos in sports. The 10 swirling stripes, five red and five white, are meant to represent two teams crisscrossing the court in a blur, and dammit if that doesn’t move me at the very core. Breaking news: Design experts almost universally pan it. “It feels so dated, so 1970s,” Fox says. “It has no personality,” O’Grady adds. “It’s very corporate — like something from an airline,” Sakahara piles on. HOW DARE YOU. This is me, plugging my ears and screaming, “Nah-nah, nah-nah, can’t hear you.” Even the Blazers have flirted with a different look; they retained Richardson’s firm several years ago for a rework but ultimately got cold feet about moving away from the pinwheel, Richardson says. STAY STRONG, BLAZERS. This should be higher than no.  7, but the current pinwheel is drowning in a black mass. Set that baby free, Portland. Let it fly and spin. Some folks prefer the old straight up-and-down version, but the slanted edition gets at the sport’s fast pace.  The title of “most famous logo in sports history” comes down to the Celtics and Yankees, so it seems sacrilegious to place Boston’s leprechaun5 here at no. 6. But there has to be some penalty for the “Would this even fly today?” question. Touchy sorts could find it offensive, and design snobs characterize it as an amateurish cartoon with a busy color scheme of green, white, black, orange-brown, and gold. “It may be loved by fans,” Fox says, “but it is derived from embarrassing clichés.” “If you took out the history, people would question it,” says Koukodimos. But you can’t take out the history — the championships, the logo’s placement at the center of the parquet, and Boston’s legacy as a hub for the Irish. The shade of green is iconic, and the winking leprechaun captures the impish obnoxiousness of a coach so confident that he lit up victory cigars before games were over. If you think this should be no. 1, I wouldn’t argue too strongly against you.  This is perhaps the favorite logo among design wonks, and when you look closely, you notice how special it is. The franchise arrived from Vancouver with a snarling, swiping cartoon that felt even more overwrought after designers researched the grizzly. “That is not the character of this animal,” says Richardson, who designed the current mark. “It’s stoic and stalwart. He’s not a badger. He doesn’t have to run around growling.” Richardson landed on a bear that is calm and fierce. The laser-focused golden eyes emit aggression, and the team colored them gold to hint at Egyptian royalty — a nod to the famous Memphis Pyramid. The blues obviously refer to both Beale Street and local music history, but they also tie into local Native American mythologies that linked the grizzly to the sky, Richardson says. Conveying so much with just an animal head rendered the rest of the bear body unnecessary, and that’s good, because full-bodied animal illustrations almost inevitably become semi-cartoonish. The team understood that the grizzly mark would never fit Memphis as snugly as it did Vancouver, but they decided it already carried too deep an NBA legacy to scrap it. “It may have been the worst team in the league,” Richardson says, “but the name had equity. And people in Memphis just didn’t want them to be the blue suede shoes, or the hound dogs.” Richardson drew “Memphis” in much larger lettering than “Grizzlies,” a wink-wink way to indicate the team belonged to its new city, even with the incongruous name.  Paul Lukas of Uni Watch went deep on Milwaukee’s new design, so let’s be brief: The Bucks nailed this. This is their best logo since the original happy scamp spinning the ball on his hoof, and the team was right to deemphasize the reds and blues that dominated Milwaukee’s forest green. That color is rare in sports, and fused with the buck mascot, it has strong connotations of nature and trees. That’s your color. Own it. The circle has more natural ties to basketball than the old triangular structure, and as Lukas pointed out, the design team snuck in two tasty optical tricks: the inside antlers that hint at the laces of a basketball, and the buck’s collar, which doubles as the team’s new “M” mark. A couple of designers argued that the team should make those hints more obvious, but I like how they fade so smoothly into the logo. The mark works regardless of whether you even notice those details.  I can hear the screeching: It’s too simple! Too basic! So obvious! Yes, yes, and yes — and that’s what makes it great. The name “Heat” doesn’t lead many productive places, but the franchise landed in the right one: tying the name to the “on fire” parlance Marv Albert, Dan Patrick, and NBA Jam turned into an integral part of the hoops lexicon. There is also a cheerleader-like feel in the way the logo freezes the action at a happy moment: when the flaming ball, presumably just out of the hands of a Heat player, flies clean through the rim. That rim is plain, and the Heat might play with livelier designs — a singed net, melting iron, or a backboard with a burn mark. But that risks cluttering up a crisp logo. The Heat contracted Richardson several years ago to draw a new secondary logo in Florida Art Deco style, but they scrapped it because it didn’t complement the flaming ball. “That’s how strong that mark is,” Richardson says. Negative points for the font, which looks like one of five “party” options from a 1991 computer.  Jordan Brand reached out to Richardson’s firm for this landmark rebrand, and the target was simple, Richardson recalls: “This is not your father’s Hugo.” The Hornets couldn’t resurrect the original Hugo; the league had classified it a legacy mark, meaning it was off-limits. The Hornets wanted a dangerous, aggressive update, and holy cow, did Richardson deliver. That squinty-eyed bugger looks angry, with stingers on every side. There is a lot of white, but that amps up the contrast with the teal sections. They are easy to see, and the sharp tension makes the logo crackle. There isn’t another one shaped quite like it, with the accented wings soaring above the bug’s body. There are separate, jagged shapes pulsing throughout, but they meld together. “It feels awake and energetic,” Fox says. “Like if you aren’t paying attention, it will sting you in the ass.” Indeed.  This was never going to end anywhere else. This thing is perfect, right down to the red on the tips of the horns, which suggests that this mean motherfucker just gored some poor sap. Look at that glare, and those flaring nostrils! The most enjoyable forms of entertainment tiptoe to the border of kitsch without crossing over, and that’s right where this logo stops. Add another color, and that blaring red might lose 5 percent of its power. Depict a full head-to-toe bull, and you’ll end up with a children’s cartoon character. This is a cartoon, but it’s not quite cartoonish. It’s simple and clear, and it depicts exactly what the team wants to be: a tough group about to shove the ball down your throat. Thank god the franchise didn’t pollute it with the awful balloon letter font that tars the court design. The Bulls know what they have. Chicago is the only team that has never changed its primary mark, and the only partial or secondary logo it has used is this exact bull head without the wording above it. Maybe the best part of this project was listening to graphics experts nitpick this. They’d start on about all the minor things “wrong” with it from a design perspective, cut themselves off, and slip into giddy whispers about how much they love it. There could be some residual Jordan-era nostalgia at work, just as the marks for the Celtics and Lakers carry more heft than they should based on artistry alone. That is how our brains work. But this red menace would hold up without the six titles, snorting animations, and pregame JumboTron montages showing a bull trampling through cityscapes. This guy deserves the top spot.",2015-09-08T11:41:43+00:00,NBA,Lowe
110,Our Annual Tiers of the NBA,"The NBA is back! For the first two weeks of the season, watching a game feels like unwrapping a present you’ve been eyeing too long. We’ve spent months wondering, “How is Team X going to use that new player?” and “How will Coach Y juggle his big-man rotation?” Now we get to see the answers in real life! It’s time for our last big preseason tradition: Tiers of the NBA, where we group teams into categories meant to time-stamp both their place in the league’s hierarchy and on their own internal development path. These are not strict power rankings, and the listed order within each tier doesn’t necessarily mean anything. Here we go: The Fourth Annual Grantland1 Tiers of the NBA. Cleveland Cavaliers: This is the only tier in which order matters. Cleveland enters the season as a slight favorite to win the title for one basic reason: If the Cavs are healthy, they might be able to walk to the Finals. They almost certainly won’t be the league’s “best” team by any measure of quality, especially since they’re dealing with injuries to Timofey Mozgov, Kevin Love, LeBron James, Kyrie Irving, Anderson Varejao, and Iman Shumpert.2 The West is loaded with teams that could beat the Cavs in a best-of-seven series. Jalen Rose declared Cleveland might not be one of the league’s five best teams. Jeff Van Gundy said on my podcast last week he’s picking the winner of the West, no matter who it is, to win the title. 2015-16 NBA PreviewEverything you need to know about the coming season.That all makes some theoretical sense. But, people: Cleveland was halfway home in the Finals last season, trotting out a gutted roster against a team that was so much better top to bottom that it was almost comical. Surround LeBron with the real Cavs in a short series, and I don’t really care if the Western Conference representative brings a better season-long point differential. Even if all five contenders from the West end up qualitatively “better” than Cleveland, the Cavs have to beat only one of them. One of those five West teams is going to lose in the first round. You can’t win the Finals without getting there, and unless Chicago or Atlanta jells in some magical way, it’s hard to see anyone in the East keeping a healthy Cleveland team from reaching the championship round — a place LeBron has been five consecutive seasons. It’s also unclear whether any of those teams from the West is actually better than Cleveland, at least once you whittle each roster down to its playoff rotation. The Cavs outscored opponents by 17 points per 100 possessions when LeBron, Irving, Love, and Mozgov shared the floor last season — a mark comparable to any of the four- or five-man Golden State units that burned the league down. They were 32-3 in their last 35 games with LeBron, Love, and Irving. Critics point out the Cavs remained a mediocre defensive team even after acquiring Mozgov, but when he was actually on the floor, they defended at a borderline top-five level. They also worked out a lot of the kinks in Year 1 of the New LeBron Era; Cleveland started the season blitzing pick-and-rolls with the frenzy of LeBron’s Heat teams, realized after about 30 games that Love and Varejao are, umm, a bit slower than Chris Bosh, and dropped back into a more conservative scheme that fits its personnel. The Cavs should do better than 21st in total defensive rebounds and they gave up a few too many 3s, but they at least know who they are now. Love’s defense will be an issue against some teams. This is his eighth year in the league; it’s time to try harder instead of just talking about trying harder. When he gives a peak effort, Love isn’t as bad as his reputation, and the Cavs have tools to cover for him. They also have a $10.5 million trade exception to add one last piece, but given their beyond-Prokhorovian tax bill after the Tristan Thompson signing, they may not use it. They might not need to, anyway. Golden State Warriors: Get out of here with the luck talk. Every champion needs some good fortune — a friendly matchup, a last-second jumper that accidentally banks in, an opponent missing a key player. Seriously: Go through every playoff season, denote all the injuries that tipped the scales even an inch, and get back to me. The Warriors obliterated the league last season. They won 67 games and outscored opponents by 11.4 points per 100 possessions — one of the biggest margins ever. In the playoffs, that margin dipped all the way to 9.0 — one of the biggest margins ever. They lost postseason games against great teams that presented unique problems, but once Golden State calculated the right solution, it crushed everyone. They’re young, they have the MVP, and they brought back every key contributor. The Steve Kerr situation presents a bit of uncertainty, even for a core that has been together so long and internalized the team’s principles so deeply. Kerr is the final decision-maker, and not just for the big stuff like benching Andrew Bogut in the Finals and going super-small. Kerr knows when Leandro Barbosa needs to feel the ball; when to sit back, smile, and ride out a Marreese Speights hot streak; when the stars are slipping back into showboating, high-turnover habits; when it might be time to stretch out James Michael McAdoo. Golden State has a brainy staff of assistants; they’ll get most of those decisions right. But Kerr has a special way of gauging a team’s pulse in the moment. Houston Rockets: If you’re looking for an off-the-beaten-path championship pick, here’s your best bet — for reasons mostly covered here.3 Playing Ty Lawson and James Harden together makes for tough sledding on defense against some opponents who counter with the right sorts of lineups. Kevin McHale’s staff does an underrated job at monkeying around with matchups to solve issues like this, but there’s only so much monkeying you can do against duos like Russell Westbrook/Kevin Durant or Stephen Curry/Klay Thompson. The Rockets need Dwight Howard near 100 percent to have any shot, even with Clint Capela rising. Houston ranked 28th in defensive rebounding rate last season, mostly because the Rockets were the worst rebounding team in the league with Howard on the bench. The Rockets gave up too many 3s last season — opponents almost certainly won’t shoot a league-low 32 percent from deep again — and they could use one more shooter who doesn’t single-handedly murder their defense. But this is a deep, tenacious crew. The Rockets are hard-capped $4 million above the tax line, so it will be hard for Daryl Morey to swing a major midseason move. But don’t count him out for a mid-salaried guy like Markieff Morris. San Antonio Spurs: The Spurs are old(er), they sacrificed some key depth to nab LaMarcus Aldridge, and he can be kind of moody, and what if he just doesn’t like wine and team dinners, and Boban Marjanovic’s ears are weird, Kyle Anderson might not be ready yet, I mean, the dude’s nickname is Slow-Mo, and, wait, I CAN’T HEAR YOU OVER THE SOUND OF ANOTHER SPURSGASM: There are reasons to worry. Tony Parker hasn’t looked himself in at least a year and the old guys won’t defy age forever. They’ll have punted real perimeter depth if Anderson and Ray McCallum prove unready for the postseason hothouse. The upside is just so damn high. Aldridge, Kawhi Leonard, and Danny Green are one of the league’s very best in-their-prime trios. Leonard looks ready to soak up more off-the-dribble responsibility, and Aldridge’s post-up game and pick-and-pop jumper give every possession a soft landing spot — one that ensures Leonard won’t overextend himself. The Spurs can play big, small, or both styles at once; they can shape-shift for any opponent. Oklahoma City Thunder: Want to talk health and luck? Since trading Harden, the Thunder have lost precisely zero playoff series in which Durant, Westbrook, and Serge Ibaka have been healthy for the duration. Zero. None. That doesn’t mean the trade was the right move. It does mean the Thunder could absolutely have won a post-Harden title — and may well do it this season, the most important in the history of the franchise. They slot a hair below the tippy-top until we see how Billy Donovan juggles minutes around his three stars. Good role players take open shots on offense, make quick decisions on cuts and passes, and play their asses off on defense. They help you by not hurting you. Oklahoma City has invested big in two supporting players, Dion Waiters and Enes Kanter, who commit gruesome acts of sabotage when they go off the rails. They’re both just 23; they have plenty of time to buff away their weaknesses and assimilate into a team structure. Donovan apparently has the clout to bring Kanter, a freaking max player, off the bench, and that could indicate Donovan has the clout to nail him there when the games really matter. The Thunder do have more traditional role players ready to absorb minutes, and Mitch McGary especially looks like the kind of big who can squeeze himself into almost any lineup — at least on offense. But some of those role guys struggled last season and most of them are one-way players. If Waiters and Kyle Singler poop the bed again, Donovan will have trouble building small-ball lineups with Durant at power forward. But this team can win it all, and the Thunder may have just enough to trade for one more rotation wing if need be. Donovan has dialed back the (sometimes) out-of-control defense into a more conservative Thibodeau–style scheme, and that should result in healthy trends: fewer 3s, fewer fouls, and better rebounding. Los Angeles Clippers: It looks like we will get an immediate answer to perhaps the biggest question about the revamped Clippers: whether Lance Stephenson, with his broken jumper and Dance Dance Revolution dribble moves, can fit into a starting lineup that already includes two big men who operate (mostly) from the elbows in. Starting Stephenson makes intuitive sense: He is the Clips’ best defensive option against Leonard, Durant, and Thompson, and his ballhandling was superfluous on bench units that include Jamal Crawford and Austin Rivers. This is the highest-upside route for the Clips: start Stephenson, bring Paul Pierce off the bench, and then finish games as need be with Pierce at small forward in shorter stretches. It will only work if Stephenson punishes defenses for ignoring him as the Matt Barnes Memorial Fifth Starter — by hitting just enough open 3s, cutting backdoor, and slicing into the paint on catch-and-go drives. He failed horribly on all three counts during a lost (and injury-riddled) season in Charlotte, and he has never been a smart mover off the ball. Laugh at the Clips all you want, but the core four starters can compete with anyone. They belong in this tier. They just belong at the bottom of it for now. They’ve upgraded the bench with high-risk, medium-reward players, and it’s fair to question a team that so openly admits it lost focus and tightened up against Houston. Randy Belice/NBAE via Getty Images Chicago Bulls: This is the team with the best chance of budging into the top tier, if only because you can get to the Eastern Conference finals without facing a real contender. It might be weird to see Chicago down here after I went out on a limb picking the Bulls to snag the top seed in the East, but we really have no evidence these guys can hang with a healthy Cleveland team in a best-of-seven series. They can get there if enough swing issues break right: Derrick Rose’s health and shot selection; Fred Hoiberg’s mixing and matching of five rotation big men; whether the team can defend and rebound well enough with the Pau Gasol–Nikola Mirotic front line;4 Joakim Noah’s knees, Taj Gibson’s ankle, and Mike Dunleavy Jr.’s back; and whether Doug McDermott and Tony Snell are ready for bigger roles. This is the one Eastern Conference team with the right combination of explosiveness and physicality to scrap with the Cavs over seven games. The Bulls can steal wins. We just have to see if they even approach their ceiling. Atlanta Hawks: People are sleeping on these guys. They are still going to be really good, even after losing DeMarre Carroll — perhaps their best overall player during a dispiriting postseason that ended amid a heap of injuries and a lot of yelling at Matthew Dellavedova. Two playoff lessons linger, though: 1. Teams will game plan for Kyle Korver and take away a meaningful chunk of his 3s. 2. Smart opponents can stay out of rotation, and shut the gaps that enable the Hawks’ drive-and-kick attack, by going under screens against Jeff Teague and daring Paul Millsap to shoot 3s. Maybe Teague sharpened his jumper over the summer. Maybe Millsap was just gun-shy in the playoffs, dealing with a shoulder injury. The Hawks missed a crazy number of open looks as their offense sputtered, but smart defenses changed the nature of those looks and generally gummed up the system. We might expect some regression on defense; the Hawks allowed the most 3s in the league and opponents shot an icy 34 percent against them. But the presence of Tiago Splitter, a true center who brings some missing rim protection, might allow the Hawks to sit back more on defense instead of pressuring so far from the rim — and allowing the drives that lead to kickout 3s. Miami Heat: Covered here. I can’t wait to watch these guys. Memphis Grizzlies: Unless Jeff Green breaks out from deep, the Griz don’t have the firepower to win four straight playoff series against elite competition. They’re good enough to win one series against anyone, but not good enough to win four in a row against everyone. The Matt Barnes–Courtney Lee wing combination could unlock some killer two-way lineups, but we have to see how much Barnes has left — and how many minutes Dave Joerger will play those guys together. This also feels like the year one of the young guys with a name starting with “J” needs to pop.5 And thus ends the 159th team preview of the past six years to hinge upon the clause, “If Jeff Green breaks out.” New Orleans Pelicans: The injuries are getting ridiculous, but if New Orleans gets enough guys back by December 1 and stays relatively healthy after that, it should be fine. Anthony Davis is that good, and with better coaching, the Pellies defense should catch up with an offense that cracked the top 10 last season despite damn near everyone missing a bunch of games. That team winning 45 games amid injury devastation doesn’t mean this version is guaranteed 50-plus wins with slightly better health. We shouldn’t assume New Orleans remains healthy once everyone returns. In fact, we should assume the opposite; someone will get hurt and it will have to scramble again. We shouldn’t even assume every player hits his return date on the nose, ready to roll at full speed. The West is better, top to bottom, than it was last season, and playing a ton of November minutes without Jrue Holiday6 and Tyreke Evans — by far the team’s two best initiators — could have a worse trickle-down effect than projected. This team could have won 50 games, or even 55, with good health. It will make the playoffs regardless, but the NBA guarantees you nothing. Ask the 2014-15 Thunder. Washington Wizards: It’s tricky to figure out when the preseason has predictive power. We shouldn’t worry about a champion lazing through the motions or an obvious doormat lighting up bench-warmers. But when a decent team just looks different, it can signal something important. The Wiz dumped hot lava over the league for the entire preseason with a pace-and-space style that looked nothing like the plodding, midrange-heavy system Randy Wittman preferred last season — at least until the playoffs. Before the preseason, the Wiz looked fragile. Nene is aging fast, and the Nene–Marcin Gortat combination suffocated Washington’s offense. Three cogs in Washington’s potential small-ball lineups — Jared Dudley, Alan Anderson, and Martell Webster — were either injured or recovering from injury. A month later, they look like a 100 percent lock for the playoffs, primed to chase something higher than another 4-versus-5 series. Kris Humphries has usurped Nene’s starting spot and shot 10-of-28 from deep in preseason after hitting just two regular-season triples over his entire career. He even canned some semi-contested 3s that required a quick trigger. That’s encouraging, because teams are going to leave Humphries (and Otto Porter Jr.) open to contain John Wall–Gortat pick-and-rolls with Bradley Beal spotting up. If Humphries can make them pay, the Wiz are onto something; Hump may turn himself into an unlikely Most Improved Player candidate at age 31. The Wiz ranked 19th in points per possession last season and can leap a few spots just by trading a few post-ups for tastier stuff. Only six teams finished more possessions with post-ups last season, per Synergy Sports, but the Wiz ranked 23rd in points per possession on those plays. Nene’s post game fell apart, and though Gortat shot well from the block, he doesn’t draw enough fouls to justify the volume of touches Wittman permitted. The Wiz will give back something on defense by separating Nene and Gortat, but Wittman has coached that end well and the trade-off is worth it. Toronto Raptors: There is a more tumultuous downside here than people might realize, but even if some of that downside hits, there’s no way these guys should miss the playoffs. They have too much talent, with a remodeled defense and an offense that should remain powerful even without Lou Williams, Greivis Vasquez, and the underrated — but always limping — Amir Johnson. They’ve swapped some one-on-one scoring for spacing and passing, and in the long run, that should pay off. Boston Celtics: The snark brigade likes to mock Boston’s cute little rebuild by noting Danny Ainge has put together a star-less team with a bunch of seventh men and no realistic path to a championship. That’s partly true; there’s no universe in which the current group of Celtics, even with above-average improvement from every player, wins an NBA title. But calling these guys “seventh men” shortchanges them. Boston has a lot of good NBA players, and there is a hard-to-quantify power in giving all your minutes to average-or-better players — and none to bad ones. That said, projection systems pegging them for 50 wins might be overdoing it. A lot of that is based on Boston’s strong play after the trade deadline, when Brad Stevens played a ton of small-ball units around Isaiah Thomas’s go-go pick-and-roll game. Those units scored well and juiced up individual player stats — numbers that figure into some of those projection systems spitting out gaudy win totals. It’s unclear if Boston can keep up that production playing with bigger groups, especially when teams wise up and drop far back on David Lee pick-and-rolls, so that he isn’t starting at an easy 4-on-3 whenever a point guard slips him the ball. Boston doesn’t have a single ball handler that scares you as both a shooter and a driver, though Marcus Smart’s playmaking in the preseason was super-encouraging; getting more from Smart would allow Boston to cut Evan Turner’s minutes and slide Avery Bradley into spot-up corner-shooting mode. The C’s compensate with constant cutting and ball movement that puts a defense on its heels, scrambling to catch up with all the directional changes. It’s hard to guard, but smart teams might succeed by forming a shell and forcing Boston to kick it around the perimeter. Kelly Olynyk is the one Boston big who can bust that strategy with his passing and shooting; he is poised for a breakout season. In the big picture, Boston is in the happy position of not banking on any one method of advancing to the next level. The Celtics will have cap space, they could net a game-changing star in the lottery with one of Brooklyn’s picks, and they’re gathering the goods to make a Godfather offer for any disgruntled star. The league is entering an interesting phase of team-building — and maybe of stasis in lots of places. Lots of teams talk about accumulating assets for that sort of Kevin Garnett– or James Harden–style trade, but they must face the hard reality that Boston, Philly, and even Phoenix can outbid them.7 Teams selling the hope of cap space are pedaling false dreams in a league where almost everyone — including good teams in attractive cities — has max-level space. Even trades might become harder to pull; teams figure to hoard first-rounders after a bunch zoomed around the league last season, and there just aren’t a lot of multiyear contracts attached to solid players who teams are anxious to dump. Where does that leave teams in the middle, or at the bottom, and without a trade war chest to rival those in Boston, Philly, and Phoenix? Ron Hoskins/NBAE via Getty Images Indiana Pacers: They’re my pick for the no. 8 spot. There will be nights against bully-ball teams when the Pacers face a painful choice: overtax Paul George or play most of the game with two (blah) traditional big men on the floor. But they have the goods and coaching smarts to play smaller without overburdening George or sacrificing too much on defense. One injury could knock everything off-kilter, but you can say that about almost anyone. Milwaukee Bucks: It’s fine if you want these guys in the “sure-thing playoff team” tier. It would not surprise me one bit — you reading this, angry Milwaukee fans? — if the Bucks made a repeat playoff appearance and scared a powerhouse in the first round. This is a fun team on the upswing, and it added one monster free agent to lubricate a squeaky offense. But franchise growth doesn’t always unfold along one neat, continuous line. The Bucks were not some juggernaut last season. They finished at exactly .500 and limped to an 11-18 record after swapping Brandon Knight for Michael Carter-Williams.8 They are relying hugely on two 20-year-olds, one of whom is coming off a torn ACL. They are going to play a lot of lineups, including their likely starting group, featuring three guys who can’t shoot. They won’t catch the league by surprise again with their aggressive trapping and overloading defense, and they have to absorb Greg Monroe’s slow-footed game into that system. Again, these are great days for the Bucks, and their collective youth could blow up the other way. If everyone makes one discrete improvement without sacrificing anything else, the combined effect could be exponential. Hell, Giannis Antetokounmpo revealing a reliable 3-point shot would change the entire look of Milwaukee’s core lineups. But few teams this young, undergoing this much change, are gifted a playoff spot. The Bucks will have to fight for one. Detroit Pistons: Detroit went .500 after starting 5-23, and the Pistons destroyed opponents when Reggie Jackson and Andre Drummond did their pick-and-roll dance without Monroe on the floor. They defended well in those minutes, though the most-used such group allowed an ugly 112 points per 100 possessions, per NBA.com. They have to prove they can defend at an above-average level over extended minutes, and Jackson needs to nail enough jumpers to keep defenses from ducking under every pick against him. This is a solid team. It just feels like the Pistons need one more proven wing guy to leap into the thick of the playoff race, especially since Marcus Morris will play a lot of power forward in smaller lineups. Jodie Meeks has only produced in short spurts and Stanley Johnson is 19. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope showed flashes of a nice catch-and-drive game last season, but Detroit may need more than the typical Year 3 bump from him. Melissa Majchrzak/NBAE via Getty Images Utah Jazz: We’ll have more on these guys shortly. They enter as favorites to snag the no. 8 spot. They have a gaping hole at point guard, but they can paper it over by playing Rodney Hood, Gordon Hayward, and Alec Burks together, and their defense should carry them to a lot of wins. One thing to monitor: Rudy Gobert wasn’t quite his skyscraper-squashing self in the preseason after playing all summer for France. Phoenix Suns: This is the hardest team to peg in that nebulous range between 38 and 48 wins, in part because the Markieff Morris situation could turn volatile at any moment. These guys are deep at every position, they can play with four-out spacing over entire games, and they’ll be well-coached on both ends. In our rush to coronate Utah and the Stifle Tower, we might be overlooking a solid team here. Jeff Hornacek and Ryan McDonough should get the time to see their vision through. They’ve done artful work building a winning roster while keeping the cupboard stocked with extra picks and cap room — money Aldridge damn near took in July. We have to see how Knight and Eric Bledsoe mesh after their late-season collapse on offense in 2014-15, and whether Tyson Chandler can instill some discipline in this foul-happy crew on defense. Charlotte Hornets: These guys probably belong in the “8-seed” tier, but their long-term picture is so cloudy, I couldn’t resist sliding them in here. They could absolutely make the playoffs. Their offense should improve with jolts of playmaking and shooting across the roster, and Steve Clifford will cobble together a stingier defense than anyone has the right to expect with Michael Kidd-Gilchrist out for the season. Cody Zeller might be the only above-average defender on the team — your Nicolas Batum mileage may vary — and it’s just hard to build a good defense with that kind of personnel. Over the long haul, it’s just not clear what the Hornets are doing. They turned down four first-round picks to draft Frank Kaminsky, and jobs across the organization could be in jeopardy if they miss the playoffs this season. Don’t rule out a desperate future-for-present trade if things start badly. Kemba Walker is 25 and has managed to shoot 40 percent from the floor once. Batum and Al Jefferson will both enter free agency as the cap leaps, and spending huge on either isn’t exactly appetizing. New York Knicks: I had these guys in the race for the no. 8 spot, but Arron Afflalo’s nagging hamstring issues give me enough pause to knock them down a tier. The Knicks are too thin to suffer a long-term health issue with any of their proven players, let alone a wing on a team overstocked with bigs and tweeners who fit best at power forward. Robin Lopez isn’t quite fearsome enough to prop up a defense that hasn’t sniffed adequate since Chandler’s first year in New York. There is a road map to 35 or 40 wins here: Surround Carmelo Anthony with shooting and one behemoth in the lane, approach league-average defense, and bask in the crappiness of the East. It just feels like too many good things need to flip right. Zoom out and there’s an obvious tension building around both a 31-year-old star with bad knees and a 20-year-old string bean bursting with potential. I would bet huge amounts of money Anthony finishes out his current contract with a different team. Sacramento Kings: There is a real NBA team somewhere beneath the circus tent, one that could challenge for the no. 8 seed. But it will take time, especially with the potentially fatal spacing issues in teaming Rajon Rondo, DeMarcus Cousins, Rudy Gay, and another traditional big man in the starting lineup. Sacramento isn’t as good as Utah or Phoenix; the parts don’t fit as cleanly. George Karl specializes in chaos, but it’s asking a lot to push this roster toward the playoffs in the West. They’ll need some luck and probably an injury or two above them in standings. Long-term, the Kings hemorrhaged draft assets in the hilariously one-sided early-July trade with Philly that opened up extra cap space for one of the Rajon Rondo/Marco Belinelli/Kosta Koufos signings.9 That would be fine if the Kings were a win-now team, but are there any foundational pieces here beyond Cousins and (maybe) Ben McLemore? How are the Kings going to upgrade going forward, beyond overspending in free agency along with 20 other teams sporting huge cap space? Brooklyn Nets: Yes, the Nets could have enough cap space to fit two max contracts this summer. Guess what? Damn near the whole league will have max-level cap space, and most of those teams can offer better basketball situations than Brooklyn. The Lakers will come calling with that same double-max cap ammo, only they also have Los Angeles and four interesting players age 23 or younger — including two top-10 picks. The Nets have zero such players and they don’t own their own pick until 2019. This is so depressing. Let’s move on. Dallas Mavericks: If Chandler Parsons and Wesley Matthews were humming, you could envision a top-10 offense, rich in shooting, carrying a blah defense to the back end of the Western Conference playoff race. Sadly, those guys aren’t 100 percent; Matthews is game to play in the season opener, because he’s a bad-ass MFer game to play anytime and anywhere, but history suggests it will take him months to rediscover his top form. Mark Cuban’s free-agency adventures haven’t yielded a win at the highest levels yet, and Dirk Nowitzki’s clock is ticking. If Matthews and Parsons recover by the end of the season,10 you could envision a star free agent — perhaps Howard, still a Dan Fegan client — seeing himself as the missing piece between the Mavs and a title run. But that looks like a hard sell from here, especially with Howard on a contender already, and the Mavs are out a key draft pick via the Rondo deal. The post-Dirk landscape is a complete unknown. Denver Nuggets: Mostly covered here. There is a cognitive dissonance in the way some league execs shriek about Philly sullying the game and then mock Denver for refusing to stomach a full teardown. Talent evaluators love Emmanuel Mudiay and Jusuf Nurkic, and you’ll know Nikola Jokic’s name soon enough. If it turns out Denver has three top prospects under 22, plus more picks coming, is it really so disastrously bad that it turned down hard offers of more picks for Wilson Chandler and Danilo Gallinari? The Nuggets could revisit those offers this season, though they may never get the kind of bounty they rejected. That said, it’s hard to find a long-term path to contention beyond nailing the draft year after year. They can’t compete with Boston, Philly, and Phoenix in the trade-for-a-star derby, and their cap room won’t have much value over the next two or three years — when everyone has it. Stacy Revere/Getty Images Orlando Magic: The Magic are dying to make the playoffs, but given the youth of their roster, they have to accept that they may be a year away. And that’s fine. They have a half-dozen guys 25-and-under with a legit shot at developing into at least above-average rotation players. They just need time to bake the cake, work the back end of the lottery again, and chase the kind of veteran free agent — the next Millsap, basically — who fits their vision. Minnesota Timberwolves: It’s hard to overstate how beloved Flip Saunders was — how beloved he is, and will be — in the NBA. When the news for which we were all bracing broke Sunday, my phone overflowed with texts from team executives: stories of Saunders’s kindness, his ability to wink at the fun we were all having, his competitiveness, his basketball IQ. I didn’t know Saunders well, but we talked now and then. He was generous with his time. He’d go deep into the weeds of X’s and O’s, interspersing his commentary with jokes and gossip. If you loved the game and showed him that, he had time to teach you. He would regale you with the best stories of the old CBA — tales of short budgets and coach-GMs swindling each other in trades struck over a round (or six) of postgame beers. He took a brave shot on Garnett, did underrated work keeping the mid-2000s Pistons motoring along, and got out of Washington unscathed. It will be hard not to root for the Wolves this season. Saunders has set them up well for the future. They have the past two no. 1 picks, both potential stars, a point guard who slings magic,11 and a few other intriguing young guys. His vision in Minnesota, and his influence throughout basketball, will live on for a long, long time. Philadelphia 76ers: The Process continues. Get well soon, Robert “Bob” Covington. You are a real NBA player, and as such, you are needed here! The commingling of Nerlens Noel and Jahlil Okafor will be fascinating to watch, and the early results will play some role in determining how Philly builds its front line going forward. Count this as Prediction no. 36 if you’d like: Noel should become just the fourth player since the NBA started tracking blocks in 1973 to average at least two steals and two rejections per game in one season. Hakeem Olajuwon is the only player to crack at least 2.5 in both categories, and given Noel should play as many minutes as he can handle, he should have an outside shot of butting into the Dream’s club. One quick aside: I wrote on Friday that Philly has sown bitterness among agents for sitting out free agency, waiving guys left and right, and suffering some communication breakdowns. I don’t think any of that is a huge deal. This might be obvious, but Philly is trying to maximize the utility of every roster spot — as a potential place for a rotation player or a trade chip on a team-friendly (and probably nonguaranteed) long-term deal. The Sixers know they aren’t winning anytime soon and they aren’t going to sign free agents to deals that aren’t no-brainer trade assets. You can disagree with that, and I’ve written that Philly should have spent a little more aggressively on the low end for guys like John Jenkins, Jeremy Evans, Ed Davis, Al-Farouq Aminu, or even K.J. McDaniels.12 But even the price on the last two jumped into a range at which they might not be killer trade pieces, and that is the range at which Philly isn’t interested. The logic is simple: When you’re priming yourself for one big swing, you can’t afford to miss even the smallest chance to find a Covington-level chip. Portland Trail Blazers: The Blazers are comfortable in their post-Aldridge skin. They’re packed with young, bouncy guys they can develop into prospects or trade bait. If the progress is slow, the Blazers will snag a high pick and the chance to draft a second cornerstone player. If some of the youngsters pop early, Portland is fine being an exciting lottery team that picks around no. 10 or no. 12, since that will mean a few of its wagers have paid off. Sadly, the bottoming-out scenario probably represents an easier way to rise from the ashes. Portland has very little history as a free-agency draw, and the Trail Blazers don’t have the extra picks to play in the Boston/Philly/Phoenix game. The middle path demands more creativity, especially over the next two years, and GM Neil Olshey isn’t afraid of taking risks on the trade market. Los Angeles Lakers: The Lakers probably deserve to be in the above category. Over the past few years, they lavished Kobe Bryant with an absurd extension; lost Howard and Pau Gasol for nothing; squabbled publicly on the precise timeline by which Jim Buss might step down; cycled through four coaches of wildly varying philosophies; botched their meeting with Aldridge; mounted an embarrassing public relations campaign to prove they have an analytics department; and signed Jordan Clarkson to only a two-year contract when they had the muscle and cap flexibility to push for a longer deal. But Clarkson was a great pick at no. 46 and he’ll be a restricted free agent this summer with a tiny cap hold.13 Julius Randle looks feisty, and league observers generally applauded L.A. for taking D’Angelo Russell at no. 2. Keep an eye on Larry Nance Jr. A Lakers team with blue-chip youngsters and mega cap room is a dangerous animal. The Lakers, somehow, might be on a path to somewhere. They are like the lost camper who wanders blindly through the forest, accidentally drops a cigarette, burns the whole forest down, and sees their destination twinkling in the distance. Or maybe it’s just a mirage.",2015-10-27T10:12:06+00:00,2015 NBA Preview,Lowe
111,Tristan Thompson Continues His Poker Game With Cleveland,"When Festus Ezeli was sitting out in 2013 with a knee injury, Mark Jackson, then the Golden State coach, accused Ezeli of cheering against the team — presumably because the Warriors struggling would prove Ezeli’s value, per several team sources. Ezeli denied it during a tearful talk with teammates, and still denies it today. Tristan Thompson wants the Cavaliers to succeed, but rooting for some short-term pain may be the only play that Thompson and his agents have left after they refused to sign Cleveland’s one-year, $6.8 million qualifying offer by 11:59 p.m. yesterday. That offer, now expired, gave Thompson leverage. He could have signed it, played the season, and bolted Cleveland as an unrestricted free agent in July. His agent, Rich Paul, explicitly threatened the Cavs with this weeks ago to get them to bump their five-year, $80 million offer up to the maximum five-year, $94 million deal for which Thompson is eligible. In Paul’s scenario, if the Cavs were to balk, Thompson would sign the qualifying offer, ditch the Cavs, and snag a max deal from someone else amid the flood of cap money coming in July. Thompson and Paul did not go through with their threat. That may be a signal that they understand they overplayed their hand — that there may not be a max-level deal awaiting Thompson. If he re-signs with Cleveland, Thompson will come off the bench behind Timofey Mozgov and Kevin Love — assuming both are healthy. He’d average something like eight points and eight rebounds per game, play energetic defense, and draw some Sixth Man of the Year votes. That probably isn’t getting him a max deal, even amid the upcoming and unprecedented cap-room boom. Power forward is loaded around the league. It’s hard to name even 10 teams on which Thompson would be an obvious starter, and none of them would have LeBron James and Kyrie Irving to draw defenses away from him. Such is life when you have the offensive skill set of a center, but not the size and ability to protect the rim. The qualifying offer was about $7 million less than Thompson would earn in 2015-16 under Cleveland’s proposed deal. He’d have to make more than $18 million per season starting in 2016-17 to make up for that lost cash, and given how close that $18 million number is to his projected max, it’s not a lock that Thompson would have managed to equal out the money. The Cavs understood this, and held firm. And so here we are, with Thompson holding out, hoping the Cavs ache so badly without him that they cave. Love is still recovering from shoulder surgery, though he could be ready for opening day. Mozgov is limited after offseason knee surgery. Anderson Varejao is recovering from an Achilles tear, and he’s a center anyway. Sasha Kaun is an unknown at this level. Iman Shumpert is out for three months, which could force Richard Jefferson into playing emergency minutes on the wing instead of as a small-ball power forward. Paul can plausibly look at all this and say, “You need Tristan to win the title, and you need him right freaking now.” The Cavs won’t have the cap space to sign a big-money replacement for Thompson this summer if he bolts, and they probably never will as long as LeBron, Love, Irving, and key supporting players are in town on huge contracts. They might be able to replace some of Thompson’s production on the cheap, but there is no easy path to an eight-figure salary slot. Cleveland will likely only have small cap exceptions, and those things aren’t buying you a facsimile like Trevor Booker or Ed Davis1 in a climate where teams almost literally have too much cap money. The Cavs aren’t budging today, but they also aren’t going to use their newfound leverage to squeeze Thompson. They won’t burn that five-year, $80 million deal and low-ball him. Paul also represents LeBron, currently cycling through one-year contracts that whisper over the shoulder of Cavs GM David Griffin every summer: “I can leave if you fail.” Everyone has an incentive to preserve good will, which is why Thompson signing that five-year, $80 million deal — or something right around there — has long been the only outcome that really made any sense. The two sides are now free to negotiate any kind of deal, including a one-year contract, though the Cavs have no reason to offer that anymore. If Thompson holds out all season, he becomes a restricted free agent all over again. That’s not a good enough outcome for Thompson to punt one full year of salary during his prime. Thompson’s side floated a three-year, $53 million compromise last week, but that compromise doesn’t do much for the Cavs. It’s essentially a shorter max contract. It would inflict the same short-term tax punishment without the long-term benefit of having Thompson under contract through his prime. The Blazers and Sixers could make things easier on everyone by making an offer the Cavs could match, but neither seems interested in doing so. The gap between Cleveland’s proposal and Thompson’s max — about $2.5 million next season, and $14 million over five years — matters more than it might appear. That $2.5 million alone would cost Cleveland about $12 million next season in extra tax penalties.2 Dan Gilbert is already spending an insane amount to keep this team together, but that doesn’t mean he should mindlessly add $12 million to the pile just to retain a key reserve — especially when he has some leverage. The Cavs are not totally without options if Thompson holds out for months. The corpse of Brendan Haywood left behind a $10.5 million trade exception, and the Cavs can trade a future first-rounder that would almost certainly become a 2018 pick.3 That’s enough to start talks for someone like Davis once he becomes trade-eligible on December 15, or even Markieff Morris if he pipes up again. Sources around the league say Channing Frye is available now for very little, though Magic officials deny it. Other names will hit the market, but while the salary of someone like Kenneth Faried doesn’t quite fit the exception, how much would Denver really demand to dump J.J. Hickson into it? Thompson on a five-year, $80 million deal might be movable as the cap rises. Thompson at the max is tougher to trade. Mozgov is an unrestricted free agent after this season, and he’s going to cost a ton — perhaps up to the max. Mozgov revived the Cavs last season, and he’s a perfect front-court partner for the LeBron-Love star tandem — a legit center who can screen for LeBron while Love spaces the floor and works the elbows, destroy the boards, and barricade the rim on defense. Thompson can do the first two of those things, and he showed flashes of explosive rim protection in the playoffs when he played at peak effort; the Cavs outscored opponents by a ridiculous 15 points per 100 possessions when LeBron, Love, and Thompson shared the floor last season. Thompson isn’t a great pick-and-roll finisher, but he’s fast, and he sucks in defenders just by scooting down the lane; Cleveland scored at a very high rate on possessions that included Thompson screening for either LeBron or Irving, per SportVU data provided to Grantland. But Thompson and Mozgov are third wheels in those trios, and no reasonable team would pay near-max money for two third wheels who shouldn’t play much together. They did out of necessity after Love’s injury in the playoffs, and the Cavs got within two wins of the title. But the limitations of the Mozgov-Thompson duo forced LeBron into an unsustainable bulldozing mode that exhausted him. Cleveland doesn’t want to choose between the two, but if Thompson’s price gets high enough, the Cavs might have to. None of this is to denigrate Thompson’s game, or his role in Cleveland’s run to the Finals. He was sensational. He embarrassed Paul Millsap and Pau Gasol on the glass, showed an improved touch on putbacks, and stifled Jeff Teague, Derrick Rose, and other perimeter players on switches. The Cavs can smother your preferred pick-and-roll combination in crunch time by slotting LeBron on the ball handler and Thompson on the screener, and switching at will. Opponents have to think twice about doing that to the LeBron-Thompson combination on the other end, even if they have a big who can hang with LeBron; leaving a smaller guy on Thompson is a recipe for death on the glass. He’s such a dangerous offensive rebounder that opponents in the playoffs started putting their best box-out guy on Thompson, even if it left an overmatched forward to check Mozgov. Teams send extra bodies to the defensive glass to protect against Thompson, neutering their transition attacks. Thompson is the rare offensive rebounder so deadly that he changes game plans. The mere threat of his glass-eating creates trickle-down effects that are sometimes hard to see. He’s just a tough piece to fit in a league where having at least one big man who can shoot at all times is almost a necessity. Millsap can play with anyone; Thompson can’t. He’s a complete non-shooter, and he hasn’t learned to compensate by tossing quick-hitting interior dishes through the tiny slivers that open when he rolls to the basket. He just doesn’t read the floor fast enough. He likes to pause, gather the ball, bring it below his waist, and prime for the next move as help defenders swipe at him. Thompson is not an especially explosive above-the-rim finisher. He needs time to load up for jumps, and defenders use that window to rotate over and swat him. That’s not ideal for a garbage man, and Thompson on offense is basically that — a bouncy mooch. He’s in the perfect spot to play that role. LeBron and Irving draw help defenders almost every time they dribble, freeing Thompson to cut into open space and gobble up offensive rebounds when those guys miss. A lot of his offensive boards come when he screens for James, rumbles down the lane with defenders behind him, and waits to see if LeBron misses. His ability to switch on defense will become more important as the league gets smaller, faster, and more pass-happy, but he’s not quite an All-Defense-level player. He suffers half-second blips of confusion off the ball as the rotations fly fast and furiously, and his help at the rim has been inconsistent. Thompson’s a nice player, but the Cavs are playing the market well in betting that their five-year, $80 million offer might be as good as it gets for him. And Paul is justified in using Cleveland’s semi-urgent health situation against it. This is a tricky situation, but Cleveland has a bit more leverage today than it had yesterday, and it just seems like an easy and fair compromise has been staring both sides in the face for months. Cleveland has offered a fair deal, and it’s uncertain if Thompson can do any better on the open market — if he ever gets there.",2015-10-02T14:23:12+00:00,2015 NBA Preview,Lowe
112,Run’d Out Rebel: Anthony Bennett’s Buyout Guarantees His Ignominious No. 1 Status,"Few things in the NBA have been as dispiriting over the past two years as watching Anthony Bennett drift through games like a shadow who may or may not be visible to the other players. The Wolves are in the process of cutting bait on Bennett1 with a $3.6 million buyout, putting in play a scenario in which Bennett ends up the worst no. 1 pick in league history — a status he didn’t ask for and clearly didn’t deserve. Being the “worst” pick isn’t just about that one player; it’s about the opportunity cost of picking that one player over everyone else, and it’s not as if Bennett’s 2013 draft class has blown the league away. Re-draft today, and it’s plausible — likely, actually — that Giannis Antetokounmpo and Rudy Gobert would be the top two picks in some order. They went at nos. 15 and 27, respectively. Cleveland lost value by reaching for Bennett at no. 1, but it wasn’t an insane pick at the time, and none of the reasonable alternatives are going to inspire “what if?” stories for the next 30 years. This is not LaRue Martin over Bob McAdoo, Greg Oden over Kevin Durant, or Sam Bowie (at no. 2, of course) over the G.O.A.T. But it still hurts. Bennett was so bad as a rookie, injured and fatigued and out of shape, that he was more a thrown-in to the Kevin Love deal than a second no. 1 blue-chipper to pair with Andrew Wiggins. Maybe there is a world in which Wiggins, Thaddeus Young, and filler are enough to snare Love, and Victor Oladipo is a Cavalier. Flip Saunders might scoff, harrumphing that he’d have driven a harder bargain, but we’ll never know. Love for Wiggins alone is a freaking home run, considering the history of superstar trades and Love’s desire to bolt Minny. We do know that Bennett is done after an even more miserable sophomore year in Minnesota. The Wolves will shave off some of Bennett’s $5.8 million salary for this season, and they clearly couldn’t give Bennett away. They peddled him everywhere, including to teams with cap space to absorb him in exchange for a token top-55-protected second-round pick Minnesota would never see, per several league sources. No one bit. The Wolves probably could have dumped him on Portland or Philadelphia by attaching a second-round pick, and most second-round picks aren’t worth $5.8 million. But Minnesota’s upcoming second-rounders will be high, and if Glen Taylor is willing to eat most of that $5.8 million to preserve the 37th pick, that’s good for the franchise. Knowing Philly, it’d have demanded more than one second-rounder to get him, anyway. Such a deal would have netted a nice trade exception, but a lot of those expire unused. The league knew Minnesota had 16 guaranteed contracts, one over the maximum roster ceiling, and that it needed to dump someone. But there was another option: keep Bennett, and cut someone else — likely Croatian sharpshooter Damjan Rudez. The roster is only overstocked because Minnesota felt it needed three hardened vets in Kevin Garnett, Tayshaun Prince, and Prof. Andre Miller, Ph.D. You really need all three of these dudes? I mean, the world needs Prof. Andre Miller throwing lobs and punking fools in the post, but Prince seems like a luxury — even given Minnesota’s need for wing depth. Bennett has been an abject disaster, but there’s an interesting player somewhere under the rubble. It seems early, given Bennett’s medical history, to write him off as a sunk cost. The Wolves have a glut of bigs in front of Bennett, but minutes would have emerged for him over the 82-game grind. Garnett will start, but he’s a 20-minute player at this point. Nikola Pekovic is always hurt. Nemanja Bjelica has scorched Europe, but the transition to the NBA is tough for almost every international star who comes over mid-career. Adreian Payne is hoppy and rangy, but it’s unclear if he’s an NBA rotation player. Karl-Anthony Towns and Gorgui Dieng are locks to play big minutes, and Saunders told me in July that the team still wanted to carve out time for Shabazz Muhammad to play some small-ball power forward. The minutes crunch was real, but Bennett would have gotten extended looks if he showed up engaged and ready to play with urgency. Portland and Philly can still claim him off waivers, though doing so would mean eating his salary. That would leave the Sixers with something like $7 million in cap space,2 and that’s not enough to butt in as a salary dumping ground in every big-money trade conversation. Portland can swallow Bennett and maintain something like $15 million in space — most in the league, and enough to snag some assets in exchange for eating more money down the line. Utah has theoretical cap room, but its roster is almost full, and it’s not touching Bennett, per several league sources. Claiming Bennett would keep him out of free agency, where he would have his pick among more suitors. Most of those suitors could offer only the minimum salary, and Philly or Portland could trump that with deals at $2 million or $3 million for the 2015-16 season. That amounts to at least double Bennett’s minimum salary, but that difference may not be enough for Bennett to sign somewhere he’s not comfortable. He would probably be comfortable in Portland, since he knows Jay Triano, a Trail Blazers assistant who is Bennett’s head coach during international tournaments with Team Canada. The Blazers are loaded with young bigs who need minutes, plus a wing who can slide to power forward in Al-Farouq Aminu. They also have 13 guaranteed contracts, and at least two players on non-guaranteed deals — Tim Frazier and Luis Montero — they find at least a bit interesting. They could buy out Mike Miller to make room, but it’s not as if Portland’s roster is bare. Philly has Nerlens Noel and Jahlil Okafor as cornerstone bigs, and all three of Furkan Aldemir, Richaun Holmes, and Jerami Grant figure to see minutes at power forward. Bennett would get a ton of time there, but if Philly doesn’t claim him off waivers, it’s unclear if Bennett wants to dip his toe into the NBA’s most aggressive rebuilding situation. As a side note, this is an interesting moment for Philly — especially with Portland slotted alongside the Sixers as a competitor for Bennett. Philly mostly sat out free agency again before signing Kendall Marshall to a four-year deal, with the last three seasons non-guaranteed. Classic Philly. The Sixers used most of their cap space to swallow bad contracts from Sacramento, and the Kings paid them handsomely with a future first-rounder and two pick swaps. Those are nice things. But the Sixers have a ton of picks already, and rival executives are curious about why Philly didn’t take a shot on some young players who signed for cheap. Aminu is at the high end of that market, but why not take a minimum-salaried curiosity like, I dunno, John Jenkins, Jeremy Evans, or Justin Holiday, and lavish him with a three-year, $8 million deal as the cap is set to skyrocket? Philly sniffed around offer sheet possibilities for Jimmy Butler and Kawhi Leonard, sources say, but that’s basic due diligence. Marshall is a smart signing, and he potentially handed his entire prime to the Sixers on a cheapo four-year deal. But if the Sixers bent a little bit more from their standard non-guaranteed, long-term contracts, they could have outbid the market on some interesting fliers. Bennett represents another chance to do that. He may hit the minimum market, and if he gets there, watch out for Toronto. Bennett is Canadian, and the Raptors have both a potential roster spot and room for a flier at power forward. All four of Patrick Patterson, Luis Scola, James Johnson, and DeMarre Carroll will see time there, but if someone gets hurt, the Raps could toss a guy like Bennett onto the floor. Bennett has only one even semi-proven NBA skill: rolling to the basket hard, catching the ball, and doing something productive close to the rim. That’s not always an easy skill when a guy is too short to play center or protect the rim on defense. Any team playing Bennett will need another big to do those things alongside him, and if that big can’t space the floor, Bennett will just run right into him on his cuts to the hoop. A pairing of Bennett and Jonas Valanciunas would cramp spacing. Two interior-oriented bigs can thrive in tight spacing if they are smart and skilled enough to work the ball through tiny corridors. Bennett has shown no such skill. He has 65 assists in two seasons, and though he improved his passing in Minnesota, he’s a hog when he catches the ball in the paint. He’s an explosive hog, but still a hog. He’ll catch in a crowd, take one dribble, pump fake, pivot, fake again, and toss up something even as shooters stand open around him. Sometimes that something is a lefty dunk that makes you say, “Holy shit, now that looked like a no. 1 pick!” but sometimes it’s a hopeless fling. Those hopeless flings close to the basket are better than the hopeless flings Bennett lets fly from 20 feet on pick-and-pops. Boil Bennett’s career into one clip, and it would be him screening, lazily fading to the dead zone just inside the 3-point arc, catching a pass, hoisting a moon-shot jumper, and jogging back on defense after it misses. Two minutes later, he’d be jogging back to the bench, another aimless shift in the books. When his trigger finger gets itchy, Bennett looks like the rightful heir to Byron Mullens as the player who goes into his shooting motion most quickly upon catching the ball. It doesn’t matter if there are 15 seconds left on the shot clock and an easy ball reversal is staring him in the face. If Bennett wants to shoot, that baby is going up almost before he even catches the pass. He has a pump-and-drive game in his bag, but he doesn’t use it enough. He cannot resist the lure of a midrange J. It got worse last season, when an ungodly 47 percent of his shots were long 2s. He hit 33 percent of them and all that chucking kept him away from contact and off the foul line. It was hideous. He doesn’t have a bad stroke and he showed theoretical 3-point range in college at UNLV. That hasn’t translated to the NBA and an alarming number of Bennett’s quick-release 3s drew air. Bennett’s defense has been a horror show of mistakes, miscommunications, and shoddy effort. He lives in no-man’s-land. He arrives too late, or too soon, calls out screens as they’re already happening, and can’t sort through all the decisions he has to make in a few seconds. At times defending the paint, he has looked tentative, and almost sad. He has long arms and some bounce, but he just hasn’t been up for the fight down there consistently enough. He has the mobility to give you a good first effort, but when the scrum starts to boil, Bennett sometimes just wants out. Every advanced metric on his defense, both public and private, is beyond awful, and that matches the eye test. That’s the first thing Bennett has to change: try hard, every goddamned possession. Watch film of the guys who do that, and get in the required physical condition. This guy is fast, he does have long arms, and he can jump. Those things are interesting. He occasionally switched onto ball handlers on the pick-and-roll, and held his own shadowing those little guys. He’s fast enough to leap out on point guards, and then recover onto Dirk Nowitzki types before they can unleash their own pick-and-pop jumpers. Those things are interesting, too. And again: He averaged two assists per 36 minutes last season, a huge improvement over his time in Cleveland. He started to learn where his teammates were and where they would be in his next mental snapshot. An Anthony Bennett who rolls like a madman, mixes in more passes, and works on his defense is worth a look as a high-energy rotation reserve — and that’s before factoring in any resurgence in his jump shot. Getting him on the minimum would be a nice win for someone.",2015-09-23T15:21:11+00:00,NBA,Lowe
113,From BMI to TMI: The NBA Is Leaning Toward Wearable Tech,"The NBA is putting its own money into the study of wearable GPS devices, with the likely end goal of outfitting players during games, according to several league sources. The league is funding a study, at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, of products from two leading device-makers: Catapult and STATSports. The league declined comment on the study. Most teams already use the gadgets during practices, and Catapult alone expects to have about 20 NBA team clients by the start of the 2015-16 season. The Fort Wayne Mad Ants wore Catapult monitors during D-League games last season in an obvious trial run for potential use at the parent league. Weighing less than an ounce, these devices are worn underneath a player’s jersey. They track basic movement data, including distance traveled and running speed, but the real value comes from the health- and fatigue-related information they spit out. The monitors track the power behind a player’s accelerations and decelerations (i.e., cuts), the force-based impact of jumping and landing, and other data points. Team sports science experts scour the data for any indication a player might be on the verge of injury — or already suffering from one that hasn’t manifested itself in any obvious way. The devices can show, for instance, that a player gets more oomph pushing off his left leg than his right — evidence of a possible leg injury. They will show when players can’t produce the same level of power, acceleration, and height on cuts and jumps. Those are typical signs of fatigue, but there is near-total consensus among medical experts that fatigued players are more vulnerable to all sorts of injuries — including muscle tears, catastrophic ligament ruptures, and pesky soft-tissue injuries that can nag all season. The Warriors rested Klay Thompson and Stephen Curry last March after data from Catapult devices (used in practices) and SportVU cameras indicated their bodies had reached extreme fatigue levels, as Ken Berger of CBS Sports reported during the Finals. Injury prevention is the Holy Grail of sports science and analytics. It might be the area in which teams are competing most fiercely for the best people and information. Several teams with respected medical personnel, including the Hawks, Warriors, Pistons, and Bucks, nonetheless overhauled their training staffs over the summer in search of cutting-edge researchers. The Bucks this week became the first NBA team to use Catapult’s ClearSky program, which includes a special indoor GPS tracking system. Mavs owner Mark Cuban is a major investor in Catapult, and the Mavs were an early adopter. It’s unclear at first look why the NBA would spend money to conduct its own study. Teams all over the world have been using the devices for a long time, and a giant pile of peer-reviewed academic research backs their central claims. But all of these companies are constantly pumping out new toys, and by funding its own study, the NBA gets to examine whatever it wants in its setting of choice. At a basic level, the NBA wants to be absolutely sure the products work before going to the players’ union and arguing players should wear them during games as part of a push to keep players safe — remember, this was why the league reduced the number of times a team plays four games in five days. Having data from practices and shootarounds is nice, but there just aren’t enough of those during the dog days of the 82-game slog for teams to compile a reliable database. The league can plop this study on the table and say, “We paid for this, and now we know for sure these things do what they are supposed to do.” Several GMs and other team higher-ups have privately pushed for in-game use, but they understand the league has to collectively bargain that kind of step with the players’ union. Team executives want to know as much as they can about player health, and also whether guys are going as hard as they can during games. The union isn’t necessarily opposed to in-game use of wearables. Healthy players enjoy longer careers and earn more money. There is obvious value in anything that decreases a player’s chances of suffering a major injury. However, there is a concern about how teams use the data, and who gets to see it. A player could lose a lot of negotiating leverage if the devices appear to reveal some underlying structural weakness in his body. Players would obviously want to verify the accuracy of such a red flag, and that would mean giving player representatives full access to the data — and the ability to place it in front of their own handpicked experts. Agents for players in a contract year might bristle at minutes restrictions that eat away at a player’s ability to put up numbers. In addition, the union would want a voice in determining how many teams have access to a player’s in-game wearable data. Is access limited to that player’s team, or would all wearable data from every game end up in a leaguewide database every team could use? What happens if the media finds out about some wearable red alert? “My greatest concern is how some of this information might be leaked or used in contract negotiations,” says Michele Roberts, executive director of the players’ union. Roberts did not know about the Mayo Clinic study but says she supports continued research into wearables. The union had the same reservations about SportVU camera data, which tracks running speed, distance, and player location during games. The league outfitted all 29 arenas with SportVU cameras in fall 2013, and every team now has access to the same trove of camera data on every player. (Teams can pay for more data and better interpretations of it, but they all have access to a basic level of SportVU stuff.) As an aside, tracking the ball itself is an issue for the cameras, and you can expect the NBA over the next half-decade to push for the installation of some tracking device inside the ball. That will be a fun discussion. Remember the synthetic leather balls? This debate is thornier, because it veers into medical issues and privacy law. It could even present dicey issues for the coaches and GMs who are most interested in monitoring the information. What if real-time Catapult data shows Curry reaching a critical exhaustion level in the fourth quarter of a Game 7 — and Curry himself becomes aware of it in a huddle? What would the various stakeholders want to do? Wearable devices raise lots of tough questions, but the league’s Mayo Clinic study is the latest evidence that in-game use is coming.",2015-09-17T14:25:46+00:00,NBA,Lowe
114,Labor Peace in Our Time: How the NBA’s Money Train Could Keep Chugging,"You guys saw this, right — this beam of light powerful enough to liquefy Lockout Pizza and erase memories of late-night stakeouts, decertification, Billy Hunter, buried bodies, hard caps, hard-liners, bloggissists, “enormous consequences,” and so, so much more? This is what Michele Roberts, the union’s executive director, told Davide Chinellato of La Gazzetta dello Sport about the state of talks between the union and the league (translated here from Italian): “[Adam] Silver and myself want to do everything possible to prevent the NBA to stop: the only way is to negotiate. We have already started, we will meet again in early September with the hope to announce within the end of the season that the union and the league have solved their problems.” Some of this could be bluster, and some of this isn’t completely accurate. The league and the union have not held a formal bargaining session, per sources on both sides, though they are working to schedule one soon. Both sides have flip-flopped between apocalyptic rhetoric and nicey-nice talk, and we should always assume all public comments are negotiating tactics designed to nudge the scales of leverage. Perhaps Roberts recognizes the players are munching half of an ever-growing revenue pie and don’t have the resources to outlast hawkish owners who might want to hog more than half of that pie. Roberts may be pressuring Silver to massage those hawks so the money train can roll on. Maybe it’s just talk, but look at the last part of that quote: Roberts appears to be saying that she and Silver have explicitly discussed a timeline that would have them resolve all bargaining issues by the end of this season — six months before each side has a one-time-only chance to opt out of the collective bargaining agreement, which otherwise runs through 2021. It’s one thing to smile at each other onstage. It’s another to have private talks about specific and hopeful timelines. Roberts confirmed via email that she and Silver have indeed talked about those specifics, but she added a cautionary note: “That is accurate,” Roberts says. “That is the goal. We did discuss that timeline, though it is not a deadline. It is more aptly described as an aspiration or goal.” Silver declined comment through a league spokesman. There is a rising tide of optimism among ownership sources, player agents, union officials, and other stakeholders that the league might avoid the once-assumed lockout of 2017. Everyone knows the league is doing phenomenally well. The NBA generated more revenue than projected in 2014-15 for the second straight season, and the new national TV megadeal, which will pay the league an average of $2.7 billion per season, doesn’t even kick in until 2016-17. Total league revenues, which recently hovered just south of $4 billion per year, will leap past $7 billion by 2017-18. Players don’t get as much of that as they used to, but their 50 percent share, down from 57 percent under the prior CBA, will still net them enough that the average player salary will shoot up to about $8 million in a few years. This is why I’ve been on record as a lockout optimist for the last 15 or 18 months. There are issues big and small that irk both sides, but business is just too good now for either to risk a work stoppage. The rising cap has mid-career players signing deals they had never imagined possible; do Cory Joseph, Aron Baynes, Khris Middleton, and other rank-and-file members really want to forfeit one year of those contracts so that stars above their pay grade can fight about maximum salary limits? Baseball’s audience is aging, the NFL has to navigate the concussion issue, and hockey and soccer just can’t touch the NBA’s domestic popularity. This could be the NBA’s moment. So, memo to owners, players, agents, union people, and everyone else: Can we just not screw this up? That’s easier said than done, of course. Silver proclaimed at summer league in Las Vegas that several teams were still losing money. This was treated as a bombshell, but it really shouldn’t have been. Nine teams lost money in 2013-14, according to internal league documents, and with the new TV money still years away, there wasn’t much reason to expect that to change in 2014-15. The new TV money won’t bring everyone into the black right away, even though each team will receive nearly triple what it gets from the current national TV deal. Remember: Half of that money goes to players, so total player salaries — a huge expense — rise in lockstep with the influx of TV money. The salary floor for teams this season will be about $63 million. In 2017-18, when the cap should be about $108 million, the floor will leap to $97.2 million. That $34 million increase eats up some of the extra TV cash each team will rake in.  There are some other quirks that might make it hard for some small- and mid-market money-losers to turn profits in the first year or two of the new TV deal. The league will bring in so much revenue that total player salaries across all 30 teams won’t add up to the required 50 percent of the overall pie. The league calls that scenario a “shortfall,” and Silver said in July that that shortfall could reach $500 million in 2016-17 — the first year of the TV deal. When that happens, the league simply dips into an escrow fund set aside for exactly this purpose and writes the players’ union a check for the shortfall amount (which is then equally split among the members). The players get their 50 percent share one way or another. So why does it matter if the players get that 50 percent share from their original salaries, or from their salaries plus that shortfall check? What’s the difference? Why did Silver frame the shortfall as something the league would be concerned about? It amounts to this: Each team pays an equal one-thirtieth share of the shortfall, regardless of market size, profitability, and whatever else. If the shortfall is $500 million, the Bucks and the Lakers chip in the same amount. In past years, small-market teams could count on tax payouts from big spenders with payrolls well above the tax line — distributions that could cushion the blow of an extra expense like a shortfall check. But only four teams paid the tax last season, and with the cap and tax lines set to skyrocket, the league could experience a temporary blip in which those tax payouts almost vanish. Add it all up, and a few teams might feel a profitability crunch over the first year or two (or three) of the new TV deal — even with all of that cash flooding the system. The owners of those teams might look at a lockout as the chance to seize another percentage point or two of total league revenue from the players. One percent of $7 billion is larger than one percent of $4 billion; every percentage point means more now. Those owners also understand that the 2011 lockout, as ugly and protracted as it was, did not interrupt the league’s soaring popularity curve. The new national TV deal requires broadcast partners, including ESPN, to pay the league even during a work stoppage, according to league sources. Owners would lose gate receipts from canceled games, but these are billionaires with a locked-in TV mega-deal. They can outlast the players, and they know it. This is when you say: too bad. The owners could solve a lot of these issues by tweaking the way they share revenue among themselves, and a cadre of small- and mid-market teams are already quietly waging that battle. The Lakers paid out $50 million in revenue sharing in 2013-14, per those league documents, and still made a $100 million profit. They could fork over more, at least over a short period. And some of the teams that suffer on-paper losses in their basketball operations division make up for them in other ways. The Nets have been the league’s biggest money-losers over the last two years, but that is mostly their fault for spending stupid amounts on players who weren’t worth it, and Barclays Center prints money. The league’s revenue-sharing system is a maze of equations, benchmarks, and other triggers that determine how much a team pays or receives. Some teams play in markets so large that they are prohibited from receiving any revenue-sharing money at all. Others have to hit minimum revenue benchmarks, based in part on market size, to get their fair share. There are also rules that cut off the revenue-sharing fountain once a team has reached a certain (very small) level of profitability for that year, per several league sources. It is freaking byzantine. There will be proposals for funneling the money around in different ways as the system adjusts to the jolt from the national TV deal. That fight doesn’t really involve the union or collective bargaining. Teams that scrap to break even now should leap into profitability as their local TV and sponsorship deals expire, allowing them to negotiate new ones that reflect the happy state of the league. The Clippers just emphatically turned down an offer from their local Fox Sports affiliate that would have paid them 2.5 times more per season than they get from the current local TV deal, and they were absolutely right to do it. There may be a period of very slight financial pain for some teams as the league’s new reality sets in, but the best projections we have suggest those teams can withstand that turbulence, especially with enhanced revenue-sharing, before settling into better times. And we haven’t even mentioned that any of these owners could sell now for prices that are three, four, five, and six times what they paid for their teams. Some owners could dig in and probably do a little better over the short term — even with canceled games. It just may not be worth the bad press, endless meetings, labor trauma, and the small risk of disturbing every healthy long-term trend. Also, don’t listen to any doomsday talk about these bloated player salaries — how Anthony Davis and Stephen Curry could make $30 million per season, and LeBron could crack $40 million at some point. Those numbers are huge in raw terms compared with old salaries, but not in relation to the cap. Star players are making more only because the league is making more. Max salaries are set as a percentage of the team cap, and 30 percent of $108 million is naturally more than 30 percent of $60 million. Salaries north of $30 million aren’t the sign of a broken system. They are what players deserve under the current system. Stars have argued they deserve more, and if they want to agitate for unlimited individual player salaries, that is the sort of fight that might derail labor peace. That would change the economics of the player-sharing system in ways we can’t even anticipate. It would redefine the landscape of the league. It would also hurt the vast majority of players. Other system issues don’t have the same kind of foundation-shaking impact, and both sides are free to negotiate those without opting out of the CBA. They could talk about the age limit now. Roberts and Silver could meet today about raising salaries for first-round picks, so that they more accurately reflect the current cap environment. Want to adjust the minutiae of restricted free agency? Talk about it over dinner next week. The system isn’t totally fair to everyone, of course. No rickety set of socialistic principles piled atop a capitalistic league ever will be. But the NBA has a chance to do something special here, and everyone needs to think very hard about whether they want to rock the boat.",2015-09-04T12:02:37+00:00,NBA,Lowe
115,Exum Strategy: How One Injury Put a Crimp in Utah’s Plans and Raised More Questions About Offseason Games,"The Jazz rampaged to a 19-10 record after the trade deadline by transforming, on a dime, from one of the league’s five worst defensive teams into its stingiest. Two lineup changes happened right before the Jazz took off: Utah traded Enes Kanter, opening a starting spot for Rudy Gobert, a.k.a. the Stifle Tower, and Quin Snyder swapped Dante Exum into the starting lineup over Trey Burke. Exum tore his ACL on Tuesday while playing for the Australian national team in an exhibition game against Slovenia, quickly undoing one of those changes. The news is sending Jazz Nation into a panic and apparently jeopardizing Utah’s status as everyone’s favorite “Cinderella” playoff contender that isn’t actually a Cinderella at all. This injury will almost certainly cost Exum the full 2015-16 season. Exum didn’t do much last season, but he gave the post-Kanter starting lineup some structural integrity. He enveloped opposing point guards on defense, and mostly stood out of the way on offense. Burke is too small to envelop anyone other than Isaiah Thomas, and he’s the worst kind of gunner — a point guard who shoots a lot even though he has never hit even 40 percent from the floor in the NBA. Reinserting Burke would seem to upset the fragile alchemy Utah stumbled upon by surrounding Gordon Hayward and Derrick Favors with defense-first, low-usage players. And this is where we have to chill. Exum’s injury is a blow, but Utah should still make the playoffs as the no. 7 or no. 8 seed — or at the very worst, lose out to Phoenix in a spirited race for that last spot. It’s hard to untangle the impact of two simultaneous lineup changes that carried the Jazz over a small sample, but Utah’s rise was more about Gobert than Exum. It was all about defense — the Jazz offense declined by a tick after the All-Star break — and the team hummed on that end basically whenever Gobert was on the floor. The team’s most common post-deadline starting lineup with Burke in Exum’s place outscored opponents by 19 points per 48 minutes, and the Jazz surrendered just 99.7 points per 100 possessions for the season when Burke and Gobert shared the floor — the equivalent of San Antonio’s no. 3–ranked defense. Gobert was incredible, and the guy he replaced wasn’t just a bad defender. Kanter might have been the very worst defensive player in the league among regular rotation guys. Exum couldn’t really do anything on offense, save for chill in the corner and knock down wide-open 3s when his defender abandoned him to help on a more urgent threat. And, boy, did they abandon him. Exum had one of the lowest “gravity scores” among every player who took the floor last season, per SportVU data provided to Grantland, meaning defenders strayed far from him. He shot miserably from deep when a defender was within even 6 feet of him, per NBA.com, and hit a blah 34 percent from the corners overall. Knowing your lane has value — to a point. Exum not shooting also meant Burke was not shooting, and the difference is that Burke shoots a lot. Playing Exum meant that Burke’s bricky off-the-bounce jumpers became Hayward drives, Gobert dunks, Favors cutting scores, and other good basketball things. Exum showed all the yips on defense we’d expect from a dude who turned 20 just last month, but he’s legitimately giant for a point guard, and his length created problems on some nights. Utah will be incrementally worse on defense with Burke in Exum’s place, and the trickle-down effect means many more minutes than expected for Raul Neto and Bryce Cotton — total unknowns at this level. This will all hurt, but hopefully not enough to really change Utah’s fortunes for next season. The Jazz late-season formula might not have sustained at the same level over the course of a full season. The starting lineup of Exum, Hayward, Joe Ingles, Favors, and Gobert managed just 97.4 points per 100 possessions — not enough to survive long-term, assuming Utah’s defense settles in at “very good” instead of “insanely, historically great.” That group scored a bit better after the trade deadline, but in the long run, it might have needed some off-the-dribble juice that Exum was unready to provide. Last season Exum might have been the worst pick-and-roll ball handler in league history. He shot 15-of-58 out of that play, and turned the ball over on 46 percent of the pick-and-rolls he finished — the highest qualifying individual rate ever recorded in the Synergy Sports database, which dates back to 2004. He dribbled around picks just fine, but once a help defender would block his path, Exum would melt into a puddle of panic. He picked up his dribble too early, or too late, mistimed passes, heaved the ball 10 feet over the head of his target across the court, and generally vomited away possessions. He looked off open players and threaded no-chance-in-hell passes to covered ones. He had no midrange game. In other words: He was a teenager playing in the NBA. He’d have been better this season, perhaps in part because playing for the Australian national team gives him reps in a larger scoring role. Utah doesn’t need him to run the show — that’s Hayward’s job — but it does need a secondary creator who can keep the offense flowing after Hayward drives into the paint, bends the defense, and kicks the ball out. Any healthy offense needs that. Burke is a craftier driver than Exum, and he actually shot 38 percent on spot-up 3s, per Synergy Sports. He’s awful shooting off the dribble, but Utah might achieve better two-way balance if Burke accepts a less ball-dominant role on offense. That’s on both Burke and the coaching staff. This isn’t Michigan anymore, and Burke’s track record so far in the NBA is borderline disastrous. He perked up late last season as a score-first option on bench units, but that mentality may not translate well in the starting lineup. Ingles’s place in that lineup is fascinating, especially with Alec Burks returning from injury. Ingles is a smart passer who can run an emergency pick-and-roll, but he prefers to hang out on the perimeter and whip the ball around the floor. He doesn’t  have the wheels on defense to stick with good NBA wing players. Burks and Rodney Hood are interesting options if the Jazz want to transition Ingles into a bench role — as they did for parts of last season’s stretch run. They can do damage off the dribble, and both of them are more capable than Ingles at switching onto point guards in games when the Jazz might be able to hide Burke on a nonthreatening wing player. Hood shot nearly 37 percent from deep last season, and might prove to be a nice complement to Hayward on both ends. Shifting one or more active threats from the bench into the starting lineup wouldn’t leave the reserves without a showrunner, since one of Burks or Hood would still be around. Between Burks, Hood, and a smarter use of Burke, the Jazz have options to cover over Exum’s absence. The very best option, of course, would have been Exum returning more prepared to contribute on both ends — especially on offense. Even in a long reel of Exum turnovers, you can see the outlines of an interesting ball handler. He has some fast-twitch explosiveness, and a thoughtful change-of-pace game. He’s not in a rush, but he can accelerate past suckers just when they think he’s about to pick up his dribble. Exum was still going to be a minus on offense this season, but if he would have been a bit less of one, the Jazz could have really been onto something. They also lose a year of Exum learning through mistakes, meaning he’ll be less prepared to shine in 2016-17 — when Utah might really be ready to take off. Utah had chances to upgrade at point guard, their quickest way to skip steps up the Western Conference ladder. As I wrote in April, they were open to trading their first-round pick for an upgrade at point guard, but could not find a match. George Hill may have been the most realistic option, but it’s unclear if the Jazz and Pacers ever seriously discussed such a deal, and they don’t appear likely to rekindle those talks now that the draft has passed. With about $6.7 million in cap room, the Jazz could open up more by waiving a couple of the four nonguaranteed deals they’re carrying. They could absorb Jose Calderon in a salary dump from the Knicks, throw some cash at Norris Cole (presumably alive, hanging with Tristan Thompson), or take a point guard from a team seeking tax relief — Mario Chalmers from the Heat or D.J. Augustin from Oklahoma City.1 The Bucks don’t have enough minutes for Jorge Gutierrez, Tyler Ennis, and Jerryd Bayless (a hybrid guard) behind Michael Carter-Williams and Greivis Vasquez. Bottom line: Utah is not doing anything rash for a stop-gap, at least not for now. It’s not giving up a pick for a marginal upgrade or taking on a midsize salary that runs beyond this season, like Calderon’s. The Jazz got this far being patient. Expect them to remain so. We should also expect the usual flare-up about the risk of NBA players suiting up for their national teams in the offseason. After Paul George’s gruesome leg injury last August, Adam Silver said NBA owners and team higher-ups on the league’s competition committee would debate the merits of players participating in FIBA events. That discussion is ongoing, according to league sources, with a focus on both insurance coverage and the general rules for player participation in FIBA tournaments. It’s unclear what could really change, or whether anything needs to. Teams have some authority to block their players from joining their national teams in the summer. If a team determines that a player is injured, or at risk for injury, it can hold him out; the Spurs did this with Manu Ginobili last summer, and sources say the threshold that teams must meet to prove their case is already pretty low. The only foolproof way to prevent offseason injuries is to ban players from playing basketball, and that’s an uncomfortable path. Players want to play, and teams want players to improve over the summer. If they’re not playing in some FIBA event, guys will hit the Drew League, the Clippers’ open gym sessions in L.A., or the five-on-five action that breaks out at Impact Basketball in Las Vegas. They could just as easily turn their ankle the wrong way in any of those settings. It’s plausible that international basketball takes more out of a player — the travel, the amped-up competition and pressure, the win-at-all-costs frenzy that gets players flying around in ways they never would during pick-up games. But lots of players enjoy playing for their national teams, they get better because of it, and the idea of removing the option brings the NBA closer to Big Brother territory. The NBA would have to collectively bargain any such changes with the union, and the players would justifiably fight back against any more restriction on their offseason activities. To their credit, the loudest critics of the FIBA arrangement, including Mark Cuban, have been transparent about their goals: They are concerned with money, not player safety. They get that players are going to risk injury playing in big international tournaments; they just want the NBA, and by extension the players, to get their share of the revenue those tournaments generate. This is why David Stern kicked around the notion of turning the Olympics into an under-23 event and shifting all the biggest stars into a World Cup that FIBA and the NBA would run, and profit from, together. It certainly wasn’t about altruism or player health. Bottom line is that one way or the other, players are going to play over the summer, and some of them are going to get injured. Within reason, the choice of whether and where to play should be theirs.",2015-08-06T16:47:27+00:00,NBA,Lowe
116,Welcome to Extensionville: The NBA’s Next Big-Money Community,"August has barely started, but teams are already bracing for the trickiest contract extension talks in league history. The 2012 draft class, now eligible for early extensions that would kick in after this season, has more leverage than any group of first-round picks since the league instituted rookie-scale salaries. They have the good fortune of straddling a projected $20 million jump in the salary cap — from $70 million this season, the last year of their rookie deals, to a projected $89.5 million in 2016-17. The league will be swimming in cap space without enough veteran stars to soak it up. If someone doesn’t get the extension he wants before the October 31 deadline, he can enter restricted free agency next summer knowing that at least half of the league’s teams will be waiting with max-level cap room. The true gamblers could do that, sign a one-year deal1 for the 2016-17 season, and enter free agency unrestricted two summers from now — when the cap is expected to soar again, toward $110 million. Players seeking an in-between solution might push for two- or three-year extensions — shorter than the general four-year limit — that get them back into free agency faster. Agents will push teams to price that second cap jump — from about $90 million to $110 million — into any four-year extension struck over the next two months. Both sides knew that Alec Burks wasn’t “worth” $10.3 million per season in 2015 terms when Utah inked him to a four-year extension almost a year ago, but the Jazz understood that if Burks made a leap he could outproduce his salary on the back end. Per several league sources, agents are striking a tough posture in preliminary talks. That doesn’t mean the next two months will produce stalemates, short-term deals, or near-max contracts for anyone who demands one. These same dynamics hovered over contract talks during the past year, and players, with more choices than ever, still opted mostly for long-term security; the risk of injury always looms, and the threat of another work stoppage in 2017 clouds everything. But the cap jump isn’t theoretical anymore. It’s here, thanks to a boatload of locked-in TV money that will flood the system after this season. Early extensions struck since the last lockout have generally ended up as team-friendly deals, but players might push even harder this time around — or simply try their luck in free agency. Adding to the uncertainty: Team higher-ups still don’t have a good feel for what exactly these players are. That’s always true to some degree; these guys are only three years into careers that often start before they turn 20. But the mystery is heightened with this group. Terrence Jones and Donatas Motiejunas2 have cracked 1,000 minutes in just one season each for the Rockets. John Henson has never logged more than 2,000. Want to goad a group of polite Torontonians into yelling at each other? Ask them what in the hell Jonas Valanciunas and Terrence Ross will be in three years. A number of other big names, including Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, Bradley Beal, and Jared Sullinger, have missed major chunks of time with injuries. The picture is murky, even before considering the different places from which each team enters these talks — their cap picture, their goals in next summer’s free-agency frenzy, and their place in the league’s hierarchy. Let’s take an early cruise through Extensionville: Jonas Valanciunas: It’s the classic GM rule of thumb: If a player insists on a max-level extension, and you don’t think he’s quite that good, hold your ground and let the guy enter restricted free agency the following summer. What’s the worst that could happen? The guy plays well, another team lavishes him with a max deal, and you match a contract he’s earned. There are minor risks in waiting. The player could obliterate those matching rights by signing a one-year qualifying offer in restricted free agency, but that’s a massive gamble no player has taken when presented with a max contract. A rival could offer a Chandler Parsons–style two-year deal with a player option in Year 3, meaning that even if you match, you face the dreaded endgame of losing that player in free agency two years earlier than necessary. But you can mitigate the Parsons risk, too. Chicago did so with Jimmy Butler by preemptively hitting him with a so-called “maximum qualifying offer” — a five-year max deal that, once delivered, requires any other suitor to offer at least three fully guaranteed seasons. Butler’s extension talks are instructive. In a simplistic sense, the Bulls “lost”; they could have inked Butler for something less than the max, but they wouldn’t budge from a number well below that, and come July, they had to give Butler the max deal they had refused him. Orlando might have saved itself almost $25 million by taking the opposite course with Nikola Vucevic. But you can flip that around and call it good negotiating: Chicago knew the power of restricted free agency, and it figured the gap between the two sides last fall was a price worth paying to see if Butler was really worth a max deal — and whether he stayed healthy. There’s a point at which the gap between a player’s salary demand and his max salary is so small that a team should just punt on the extension. For a good young center in this market, teams might want to inch very close to that max before giving up. Every bit of savings can help fit future free agents. Agreeing to a dollar figure below the max is a hedge against the cap rising higher than expected. A true max salary is set as a percentage of the salary cap; if the 2016-17 cap comes in above the current $89.5 million projection, any max deal negotiated ahead of time would float up with the cap.3 Extending a player at a number even just $500,000 below the projected max could bring a much bigger payoff. Ducking the max, even by a hair, makes it easier to play around with the year-over-year numbers — to keep a deal flat over time, or even negotiate salary decreases. That could come in handy if the cap actually drops in 2018-19, as the league and union currently project. Valanciunas is a lock to demand a max-level extension. Large humans get paid, and this large human shot 51 percent on post-ups as a 22-year-old banging against the world’s toughest bigs, per Synergy Sports. He’s a beast on the offensive glass, shoots almost 80 percent from the line, and should develop as a pick-and-roll finisher — both at the rim, and with a soft midrange jumper. He has also been an odd, underused fit in a Drakes offense dominated by gunner guards who prefer clear driving lanes — a problem that could persist, and harm his value, if Dwane Casey is serious about playing smaller. He’s a potent enough post scorer to draw double-teams but laughably bad at passing out of them. Building him into a plus defender, both at the rim and in open space, will be arduous. If the Raptors can’t convince Valanciunas that securing money now is worth bending a bit on annual salary, what’s really in it for them? An early max extension would also eat into Toronto’s cap flexibility for next summer. Valanciunas would go on the 2016-17 books at a salary around $21 million. If the Raptors wait, Valanciunas would count as only an $11 million “cap hold” when free agency kicks off.4 The Spurs could not have signed LaMarcus Aldridge without first denying Kawhi Leonard a max-level extension precisely to hoard this bit of wiggle room. That $10 million difference might not matter if Toronto re-signs DeMar DeRozan, but it could help the Raps seize an opportunity in free agency. They could still make room to do that, even with Valanciunas at a big number, by letting both DeRozan and Ross walk. Would the Raptors dare venture as high as four years, $80 million — below the projected four-year, $93 million max — to keep Valanciunas in the fold? That may be too rich for Masai Ujiri’s blood, and if it is, expect Valanciunas to hit the market next summer. Nick Laham/Getty Images Andre Drummond: Scene from Stan Van Gundy’s office, sometime in early October … Van Gundy: “Hey, guys. We adore Andre. He’s our guy. But we’d love to keep a bit more cap room, so it would help us if Andre would take … Jeff Schwartz (Drummond’s agent): “Wait, wait. The team’s owner already publicly called Andre a ‘maximum player.’ We really going to do this?” SVG: “Crap. I was hoping nobody saw that.” Van Gundy knows that free agents aren’t dying to come to Detroit, so he has prioritized taking care of the good players already there. Detroit could tack on an extra fifth season to Drummond’s extension by naming him its one-time-only “designated player,” a move that requires Detroit to offer the full max. Detroit could balk at that and still re-sign Drummond in free agency next July to a five-year deal at any amount, as the Pistons just did with Reggie Jackson. So why not wait, keep Drummond on the books as a cheaper cap hold, and still ink the full five-year contract? Waiting risks irritating Drummond to the point where he might entertain a three-year offer sheet from another team. The Pistons cannot afford that after botching the Greg Monroe situation. The extra cap room wouldn’t have much value for a team that wasn’t a draw when cap room was unusual, and Detroit could still carve out plenty of flexibility after a max-level Drummond extension by cutting Ersan Ilyasova — whose deal for 2016-17 is only guaranteed for $400,000. Terrence Jones and Donatas Motiejunas: These might be the two most intriguing players of this whole lot. Jones has barely logged 3,000 minutes over three seasons, but he has the potential to be the most versatile non–Anthony Davis two-way player from this draft class — especially if that languid 3-point stroke morphs into a reliable weapon. Would it be insane for Jones to hold out for at least $15 million per season? Probably not, even though he would likely be the least accomplished player ever to sign an extension that pricey. Would it even be insane for Houston GM Daryl Morey to accept that kind of deal? No one really knows, but Jones’s team will begin extension talks at an eye-popping number. Motiejunas hasn’t played much more than Jones, but he emerged last season as a legit post-up hub — a pivoting blur of cruel pump fakes and flippy hooks capable of slipping nifty passes around double-teams. He started hitting 3s from outside the corners, improved his defense, and survived at center during Dwight Howard’s absence. I’d bet slightly against either getting an extension from Houston. Morey will take a killer deal if it falls into his lap, but he knows restricted free agency is a cudgel, and he prizes flexibility. If he gets wind that a star can be had next summer, he needs to be able to act immediately. He could extend one or both of these guys and still do that, provided he gets them on tradable contracts, but the job is easier if they’re on the books as cheap cap holds Morey could make disappear in an instant. Bradley Beal: The Wizards need about $25.5 million in room to fit Kevin Durant on a max contract, and if they sign Beal to a max-level extension, they would have almost precisely that amount left over. Playing the math that tight is dangerous, and makes it hard to fill a workable roster unless ring-chasers come aboard at massive discounts. The Wiz would be safer following the path San Antonio took with Leonard, only they haven’t built up the cachet that allowed the Spurs to say, essentially, “Trust us. Hold tight as a cheap cap hold, and we’ll make it worth your while.” Washington needs to nurture the good vibes, and that means at least coming to the table. Beal may want his money now, and his side will surely propose a max-level extension. He hasn’t played up to that level yet, but 22-year-olds with silky strokes and some grit on defense don’t readily accept less. Beal might consider it after dealing with the kind of recurring leg injures that nag at a player’s anxiety. Offer a four-year deal starting around $18 million per season, about $3 million below Beal’s projected max, and he might just take it. By the way: Imagine if Washington went this route, and after the DeAndre Jordan Memorial Moratorium, the league announced the cap had somehow come in at $86 million — below projections, and perhaps too low for Washington to fit Durant had it already extended Beal. No one thinks that will happen. If anything, people expect the cap to again come in slightly above projections. But this kind of uncertainty can have a chilling effect on extension talks. One reminder: No player has ever had as much incentive as Durant to re-sign on a one-year deal with his incumbent team. But he could reap most of the same benefits by signing a two-year deal with a non-Thunder team, and he’s also coming off three foot surgeries. Dozens of competing variables are at play in the biggest free-agency case since LeBron in 2010. Buckle up. Noah Graham/NBAE via Getty Images Harrison Barnes: Golden State has only three players under contract for 2017-18, but two of them — Thompson and Draymond Green — make huge money, and if things go well, Stephen Curry will join them on a max deal starting around $30 million. The Warriors will need to replace Andrew Bogut and Andre Iguodala, and they have ambitions of luring another star free agent to the Bay as those older players fly off the books. Barnes may fit into that equation as something like an Iguodala successor, only with a better 3-point stroke and the size to spend more time at power forward. But he was the fourth option in Golden State’s starting lineup — and the fifth-best playmaker in that group — and guys who don’t create off the bounce don’t typically get mega-extensions unless they are 7 feet tall. But Barnes thrived in that low-usage role for a title team that wants to preserve its dreamy chemistry, and he’s in plum position to demand huge money if he hits free agency. DeMarre Carroll just nabbed $14.5 million per season from Toronto, and he’s six years older than Barnes. There’s only about a $6 million difference between Carroll’s deal and Barnes’s Year 1 max, and if there’s any room for back-and-forth in extension talks, it’s within that space. Barnes won’t come any cheaper. Michael Kidd-Gilchrist: Charlotte has more financial flexibility going forward, and the market for defense-first guys with shaky jumpers can be cooler than expected. Kidd-Gilchrist developed into a serviceable midrange shooter last season, but knocking down 37 percent of wide-open long 2s doesn’t outweigh the harm defenses inflict on Charlotte’s spacing by granting those looks. Kidd-Gilchrist offsets some of the damage with smart cuts, daring offensive rebounds, and breakneck rim runs in transition, but he’s a hard piece to build around. I’m intrigued by the idea of Kidd-Gilchrist seeing more time at power forward, but Charlotte has too many rotation bigs right now for that to be a big rotation feature. Kidd-Gilchrist will steal your soul on defense, but that alone hasn’t been enough to score max money for a wing player. The two sides might be able to hammer something out before Halloween. Dion Waiters: Helicopters have halted their search missions over Waiters Island. It is abandoned. One rescue crew found “Bill and Zach Were Here, Fall 2014” scrawled in blood on a rock face. Unless the Thunder wring a killer extension out of a ball-dominant chucker they don’t need, they have no reason to act early. Terrence Ross: The league’s best candidate for a “we’re not sure you’re good, but here’s $45 million” Burks-style deal — only the new version of a Burks deal might blow past $50 million over four years. Again: This is what it will take to keep some of these guys out of a free-agent market that will be oversaturated with money. Ross can shoot, but he’ll be 25 this season, and it’s unclear if he’ll ever refine the rest of his game so his shooting can really sing. He spaces out on defense, especially away from the ball, and he doesn’t have enough playmaking in his bag to create something when defenders close out on him. He shows hints — a drive, a floater, and a pass that makes you confirm it was Ross that threw it — but it never sticks over a full game. His playoff performances have been troubling. Tyler Zeller, Jared Sullinger, Perry Jones III: The Celtics have the flexibility to do almost whatever they’d like with these three. If they land on agreeable salaries, Boston could re-sign all of them without imperiling its cap room — especially since Boston somehow convinced Amir Johnson and Jonas Jerebko to swallow fully nonguaranteed contracts, worth about $17 million combined, for 2016-17. Boston can waive them any time before July 3, per league documents, giving the C’s two days to court big-money free agents who would justify opening up that extra $17 million in room. Jones has almost no NBA track record and may not even make Boston’s final roster; once Boston waives Zoran Dragic, it’ll have 16 players on its roster — one over the limit it must hit before the season starts. But the Celtics appear intrigued with Jones’s positional shape-shifting, and if he somehow sticks, they might be open to bringing him back on the kind of deal K.J. McDaniels just got from Houston. Boston could always trade a big to ease the roster crunch, and Sullinger might be the likeliest candidate to go. He’s had constant conditioning issues, he’s still a sub-30-percent shooter from deep after two years of hoisting, and he’s probably never going to be a plus defender. His agent, David Falk, does not mess around in extension talks. If Falk can’t get Sullinger a huge deal, he will have no qualms taking him into free agency. Zeller was one of last season’s pleasant surprises, scoring efficiently in a variety of ways and providing on-again, off-again rim protection for a Boston defense in desperate need of it. Depending on team context, Zeller looks like either a dynamite third big man or a very nice fourth/fifth starter. Those guys are going to run into the eight figures in the new NBA, and if Boston can snag Zeller long-term for anything under $12 million, it may jump at the chance. Gary Dineen/NBAE via Getty Images John Henson: Our own Marc Stein reported weeks ago that Milwaukee and Henson were close to a deal, but things have gone radio silent since. The two sides are still on course, per several league sources, and Henson will probably get a payday in the eight-figure range that busts past the “sneaky” label. Bigs get paid. Hell, Aron Baynes just got nearly $20 million over three seasons, and every agent repping a moderately talented big man is ready to wave that deal in a GM’s face. Henson found his NBA niche by scrapping post-ups, slicing down the lane for pick-and-roll finishes, and keeping those condor arms spread wide on defense. Festus Ezeli: Don’t laugh when the Warriors re-sign Ezeli, participant in just 124 regular-season games over three injury-riddled seasons, to something like a four-year, $40 million extension this fall. Ezeli is an explosive leaper who protects the rim on defense, and his stone hands have softened just enough that he can at least catch the ball and dunk it when he’s wide open — and cram down offensive rebounds. Ezeli doesn’t yet have the feel to be an ideal big-man cog in Steve Kerr’s system — he had just nine assists last season — but if you surround him with shooting, he can work as a screen-setter and finisher. He’s the only realistic heir to Bogut on the Dubs roster, and even if the Warriors someday deem him unfit for that job, he’d be movable at that number. Evan Fournier: He shouldn’t ever start for a good team, but Fournier is a career 38 percent 3-point shooter with some playmaking guile and the guts to sport ridiculous hairstyles. Use him as a primary ball handler and your offense is toast. Stick him on the wing while someone else does the heavy drive-and-kick lifting, and Fournier can do damage slicing into a scrambled defense. He can play multiple positions on both ends, though he probably tops out as an average defender. He’s just a useful guy to have around, and useful guys are about to get a ton of money. Orlando should see what it would take to preempt that, even if it starts throwing around numbers near the $7 million-per-year deal Jae Crowder just signed with Boston. Meyers Leonard: Any 7-foot-1 dude who rips 42 percent from deep is going to draw interest, and Leonard hit that mark last season while jacking nearly five triples per 36 minutes — and upgrading his defense from “completely clueless” to “apparently aware that a game is happening.” Remember: Leonard had barely played serious basketball before entering the NBA. He probably won’t shoot as well in a larger role for a bad Portland team, but if he sniffs 40 percent again, suitors will come calling. The Blazers have a clean cap sheet, and an extension that looks nutty now — something like three years, $21 million — might look genius in six months. Leonard’s new agents at CAA surely know this, which is why they could push for more until the Blazers just shrug and let Leonard test the market. Jeremy Lamb: Lamb flamed out in Oklahoma City, but he’s going to get minutes for a team that badly needs his shooting. Charlotte also plans to let Lamb stretch himself as a ball handler. Minutes bring numbers, and numbers bring money, so the Hornets should at least see what it would take to preempt Lamb’s free agency. They might not reach a place that makes it worth Lamb’s while, and we’re saying that about a guy who has done basically nothing in the NBA. Welcome to the new salary-cap world.",2015-08-04T09:18:56+00:00,NBA,Lowe
117,Good Charlotte? The Hornets and the Sliding Scale of NBA Mediocrity,"No team knows how hard it is to draft a star with the ninth pick better than the Charlotte Hornets. That’s why the draft slot that produced D.J. Augustin, Kemba Walker, Noah Vonleh, and now Frank Kaminsky became the pivot point for two curious moves last month — one deal made, one rejected — that have rival executives questioning whether Charlotte has any plan beyond chasing the no. 8 seed this season. In the days before the draft, Charlotte peddled that no. 9 pick and Vonleh to some of the teams ahead of it — an attempt to vault into star range. The Hornets found no takers before ultimately giving up and sending Vonleh to Portland for Nicolas Batum the day before the draft. As the drama unfolded the next night, Boston put Charlotte on the other end of a quantity-for-quality pitch. The Celtics offered four first-round picks for the chance to move up from no. 16 to no. 9: that 16th pick, no. 15 (acquired in a prearranged contingency deal with the Hawks), one unprotected future Brooklyn pick, and a future first-rounder from either the Grizzlies or Timberwolves, per sources familiar with the talks.1 Some members of Charlotte’s front office liked the Boston deal, but Michael Jordan, the team’s owner and ultimate decision-maker, preferred Kaminsky to a pile of first-rounders outside the lottery, per several sources. That’s justifiable, if you think your guy at no. 9 has a chance at stardom. The talent gap between no. 9 and no. 15 is real; ask Boston how it felt to squeeze into the playoffs, get demolished by a Cavs team in chill mode, and watch Justise Winslow fall right where it could have picked had it won three fewer games. But Kaminsky is not a star, and the players Charlotte could have grabbed with those four picks will almost certainly produce more combined over their careers than Kaminsky. And the Hornets know they cannot afford to screw up the draft. “Almost every top free agent stays with his current team,” says Curtis Polk, the team’s vice-chairman and a longtime member of Jordan’s inner circle. “The best way for us to build is through the draft.” The team is too good, for now, to expect a pick toward the top of the lottery; the East is so bad that teams outside the elite almost naturally gravitate toward mediocrity. Charlotte would be toast in the West, but it’s hard for the Hornets to bottom out in the East without trading away core young players — a pointless exercise. There are two ways to escape the netherworld of a single pick in the no. 9 range: move up or get more picks. Boston’s offer wasn’t quite Godfather-level, but it represented a road map for a team that has cycled through an alarming number of young big men — including one, Vonleh, that it flipped for a veteran in Batum who can bolt after this season. Team higher-ups defend taking Kaminsky over any draft-day trade package — even after acquiring Spencer Hawes, another shooting big man. “You have two minutes to decide: ‘Do I want to do this trade?’” says Polk, one of five men atop Charlotte’s decision tree.2 “You don’t have a day. You don’t have hours. After all the intelligence we’d done, we were comfortable with Frank. But now you have two minutes to decide if you make this trade, who you’re gonna take at no. 16, or maybe no. 20, and we haven’t been focusing on that range. In fantasy basketball, it sounds great: ‘Oh my god, they could have gotten all those picks.’ But in the real world, I’m not sure it makes us better.” Adds Rich Cho, the team’s GM: “If it was such a no-brainer for us, why would another team want to do it?” Polk argues drafting extra players might have cramped Charlotte’s roster space. “We didn’t have enough spots after picking up Spencer Hawes, Jeremy Lamb, and Batum,” Polk says. “Even if someone wants to give me first-round picks, what am I going to do with them?” Some of this doesn’t quite hold up. Charlotte had 12 players on its roster before picking Kaminsky, meaning it could have drafted two players and still had room to sign either Jeremy Lin or Tyler Hansbrough — both of whom are in Charlotte on great contracts, by the way. A well-prepared front office has enough intel on every first-round prospect to make snap decisions in the heat of the draft. Cho and his staff have the goods to pivot. Charlotte faced almost the exact same draft-night dilemma a year earlier, when Vonleh unexpectedly fell to no. 9 and another team bugged the Hornets about moving up. The Hornets started that night hoping for Doug McDermott, Cho’s pet choice, and they rejected Chicago’s offer of nos. 16 and 19 for that ninth pick — the same deal Denver ultimately received in exchange for the no. 11 pick, where the Bulls picked McDermott. The Hornets had interest in Rodney Hood, sources say, and could have nabbed him with one of Chicago’s picks. When Vonleh fell, Jordan concluded the team could not pass him up. Jordan ordered a last-minute vote, and a majority of the draft room favored Vonleh, sources say. Jordan was also pro-Vonleh. (Cho would not discuss the vote, or whether he stuck with McDermott.) Taken together, Charlotte has rejected a total of six first-round picks over two drafts to select Kaminsky and Vonleh.3 An optimist would point out Charlotte turned Vonleh into Batum, who brings the combination of ballhandling and 3-point shooting the Hornets desperately need on the wing; Steve Clifford, the team’s coach, envisions Batum as a quicker version of Hedo Turkoglu from Clifford’s days as an assistant in Orlando. Vonleh was going to ride the bench again, meaning Charlotte may have dealt him at the peak of his trade value. Batum is just 26; he can grow alongside Kemba Walker, Cody Zeller, Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, and Kaminsky. But Batum can be a free agent after this season, meaning the Hornets might have sacrificed Vonleh, still just 19, for a rental. “Sure, there’s risk,” Cho says. “If Nic were in his thirties, I could see how people might be skeptical. You try to balance winning now with winning later, and we felt trading for Nic gave us the best of both worlds.” Polk says other teams have gambled more to acquire talented guys on expiring contracts. “It’s standard procedure,” Polk says. “We’ve seen it recently with Enes Kanter, Reggie Jackson, Deron Williams, Carmelo Anthony, and Kevin Love — all in trades that happened with those players on expiring contracts.” But those situations are different. Anthony and Williams went to mega-markets they wanted to play in. Love landed on a title contender. Kanter and Jackson were restricted free agents, meaning the teams that acquired them knew they could have them for a half-decade. Batum is an impending unrestricted free agent on a borderline playoff team, diving into an unprecedented cap frenzy in which two-dozen suitors could offer $20 million per season. Batum’s people have already made noise about how much Batum would like to play in Toronto, a city that appeals to his international roots, per several league sources. He is a flight risk, even though both Cho and Chad Buchanan, the team’s assistant GM, know Batum well from their days in Portland. “We are very comfortable given that Chad and Rich know Nic well,” Polk says. “We’ve seen over the last few years that players want to be here,” Cho says. “Free agents want to come here.” The Hornets have Batum’s Bird rights, and the ability to offer him more years and money than anyone else. Charlotte might have to choose between losing Batum or maxing him out, and that looks like a lose-lose — even with another cap spike likely coming in 2017-184 that will make a potential max deal for Batum a little less painful. The Hornets should try like hell to extend Batum now, as the Nuggets just did with Wilson Chandler and Danilo Gallinari, but they don’t have the cap space to offer Batum a raise this season as the carrot to coax him. They may face the same choice with Al Jefferson, who can barely get through a season on one leg. Lose both, and Charlotte will be back almost where it started when Jordan bought the team. ??? When Jordan scooped up the Bobcats in 2010, he inherited a capped-out roster trapped in mediocrity. His goal, Polk recalls: get Charlotte into the East’s top four, a process that would take “five or six years.” Charlotte stripped away Tyson Chandler, Gerald Wallace, Boris Diaw (fat version), Raymond Felton (skinny-ish version), and Stephen Jackson in a painful two-year teardown that culminated in the Anthony Davis lottery — which Charlotte lost. The team was hemorrhaging money, and Jordan decided it was time to veer off one path and lunge onto another. The Hornets splurged on Al Jefferson, and emerged in 2013-14 as a feel-good playoff team behind expert coaching and career seasons from Jefferson, Josh McRoberts, and others. Charlotte had scraped out a path to relevancy in the weak East. The Hornets would never entice LeBron or even Love in free agency, but perhaps they were appealing enough to attract a B-level free agent — someone like Gordon Hayward, their initial target, or Lance Stephenson. If that worked, the Hornets might transform into the sort of rising 48-win team that could persuade the next B-level free agent. From there, you’re at 50-plus wins, a break or two from playing in the conference finals. It wasn’t the cleanest process, but building from the middle is messy. Stephenson’s epic one-season disaster in Charlotte revealed how fragile that process really was. The Hornets took on Hawes’s contract just to exorcise all traces of Stephenson, and they view Batum as Stephenson’s replacement. But Stephenson’s contract offered the upside of having him around for three seasons as at least one keystone to build around. If Batum explodes in Charlotte and decides to stay, the Hornets may end up executing the same plan on a one-year delay: keep the guy brought in from another team, hit some midround draft picks,5 nab sub-star free agents, and work smart trades like the deals that turned Matt Barnes into Jeremy Lamb. If you’re going to build from the middle without a homegrown star, the only way up is to pile together little hits — especially since Charlotte can’t compete with Philly, Boston, or even Phoenix in putting together trade offers for disgruntled stars. Hell, even a team that nails every step of a clearly delineated plan from a pure value perspective, like the current Celtics, can get stuck in the middle just as long as a team with a murkier blueprint. “There’s no magic wand,” Cho says. “You just incrementally piece together good players with upside.” If Batum and Jefferson leave, Charlotte will be left to search again for that first building-block free agent. And, holy hell, does this roster need at least something that looks like a keystone. Polk’s mention of Deron Williams is instructive. Trading Williams for Derrick Favors, Devin Harris, and two first-round picks was the opening salvo in what looks now like a wildly successful rebuilding job for the Jazz. Utah later gobbled up two extra first-rounders from the Warriors, including the pick they used on Hood, and a few weeks earlier had landed Rudy Gobert, the 27th pick in 2013, in a draft-night trade with the Nuggets. The Hornets never drafted a Williams-level player that could kick-start a rebuild down the road. Three straight top-five picks in the mid-2000s yielded Emeka Okafor, Felton, and Adam Morrison. The draft haul in this second go-round of rebuilding has turned out better, but not well enough. Bismack Biyombo, the no. 7 pick in 2011, is gone — even though the Hornets haven’t used a cent of their midlevel exception this summer.6 This team could use Biyombo’s rim protection; almost every rotation big man, save for Zeller, is a clear minus on defense, and Biyombo signed in Toronto at a good price. The 25-year-old Walker — selected two spots later — shot below 40 percent for the third time in four years and looks like a bottom-12 starting point guard. Houston just re-signed Patrick Beverley, another below-average starting point guard, and who may have just lost his job to Ty Lawson, for the equivalent of Charlotte’s chambered midlevel. Zeller and Kidd-Gilchrist are solid players, but for now, they don’t project to produce at levels at or above expectations for no. 2 and no. 4 picks; Charlotte has been willing to discuss Zeller in trade talks with several teams, sources say. Vonleh wasn’t ready last season, and the trouble he and Biyombo had adjusting to the NBA has Jordan swinging back toward proven college players. “That was our focus on Frank [Kaminsky],” Polk says. “He’s 22. He’s mature. With a lot of the one-and-done guys, you don’t know what you’re getting.” ??? Luck plays a huge role in the draft process, but you can’t have this many shots in the top 10 and not come away with even one player who looks like a plus pick. And these are Jordan’s picks in the end, even though his confidantes insist the GOAT wants employees who will push back. “He’s not a dictator,” Polk says. “He likes healthy debate.” “If you canvass the league,” Cho adds, “pretty much every owner has final say.” He’s right, but there are still degrees of involvement. Few owners are as active as Jordan in the basketball aspects of player-related debates. Skepticism remains among rival teams about Jordan’s stewardship. There are questions about how much college basketball he watches until a cramming session in the week before the draft. His family increasingly dominates the organization; his brother, Larry, is the team’s director of player personnel, and Jordan last year hired his daughter, Jasmine, to serve as coordinator of basketball operations. She has been in the team’s crowded war room on draft night, along with Estee Portnoy, a marketing executive who more than a decade ago emerged as one of Jordan’s closest allies — and now serves as a full-time Hornets employee. Agents have at times sidestepped Cho to chat directly with Jordan, according to league sources. The team has turned over almost its entire scouting and analytics departments in the past year. (Though the Hornets recently hired Mike Born, a well-regarded Cho ally from Portland, to a key scouting position.) The relationship between Cho and Clifford has been cool since the team dismissed Rod Higgins, a Jordan ally with whom Clifford felt he could talk hoops, per sources familiar with the matter. Cho, Clifford, and Polk all downplayed the idea of a rift, and the two wings of the organization worked well together this summer to upgrade the team’s shooting across all positions — a goal they shared. Lin especially looks like a nice fit as a drive-and-kick player on a second unit stocked with spot-up guys. “I would say it’s a good relationship now,” Cho says. “I value his input. We’re not always going to agree, but I wouldn’t expect to.” “None of these relationships are going to be perfect,” Polk says. “There are bumps in the road. We try to challenge each other.” The Hornets will have to fight for the no. 8 seed next season, and if they fall short, it could cost Clifford his job; he’s on an expiring contract himself. Clifford has a sterling reputation, and even if next season ends in a worst-case scenario, he’ll land on his feet fast. But this franchise could use some stability. The Hornets had cobbled together a track toward that coveted top-four status, but when injuries and Stephenson’s implosion derailed them, Charlotte’s front office rushed to repair things with win-now moves that forfeited potential pieces of its future. Maybe it won’t matter. Maybe Vonleh will bust, Batum will live up to a mega-contract that takes him through his prime, and Kaminsky will make everyone forget about the Boston offer. That’s a lot of uncertainty for a franchise that looked like it had finally found something to hold on to.",2015-07-28T09:33:09+00:00,NBA,Lowe
118,"The Good, the Bad, and the Tobias","Tobias Harris knows the bad things people say about him, and he knows why some teams that considered chasing him in free agency backed off. “It’s always, ‘Oh, why doesn’t he pass more?’” Harris says, acknowledging he assisted on fewer than 10 percent of Orlando’s buckets while on the floor — one of the lowest assist rates in the league for a high-usage player.1 “And everybody wants to talk about my defense. I’m not the best defensive player. I’m not gonna tell it to you like that. But if we were winning more games, people would talk about me differently.” Harris is right. Four years into a strange career, he’s a classic “good numbers/bad team” guy — an archetype that has long flustered general managers who must project how such players would fare in smaller roles on good teams. Those GMs are thinking more than usual about the question today. A ton of losing teams have been in rebuild mode, and they are now burping up free agents with gaudy numbers and dreams of earning big money under a salary cap rising to unprecedented levels. Are guys like Harris, Enes Kanter, Jordan Clarkson,2 and Michael Carter-Williams actually good? “It’s coming up more, with salaries getting so much bigger,” Warriors GM Bob Myers says. “The new numbers are going to take some getting used to.” “It’s a very tricky thing to figure out,” says Magic GM Rob Hennigan, who just re-signed Harris to a four-year, $64 million contract. “I don’t think anyone has an easy answer on what statistics mean for someone on a team that isn’t exactly excelling in the win column.” Teams have access to more statistics than ever, but when it comes to the good numbers/bad team dilemma, GMs fall back on the oldest method of talent evaluation: watching the damn games. That’s in part because there is some degree of skepticism over whether numbers compiled on bad teams mean much — even if a player compiles them efficiently. “Put the best D-League team into the NBA, and someone is going to average 18 points per game,” Celtics GM Danny Ainge says. “Someone is gonna get 10 rebounds. And that’s why you hear the doubts you’re hearing.” But Ainge cautions: “Those doubts are legitimate, but not every player on a bad team deserves to be penalized.” Some front-office types give more weight to fat stats, and more sophisticated numbers — some of them based on video — track what GMs see on film. Dig deep, and you can quantify how often a guy closes out on defense, and how many of his rebounds are easy, uncontested jobs. “We are very quick sometimes to blame players for putting up numbers of a team that isn’t successful,” Myers says. “Sometimes the losses aren’t their fault. Sometimes you put them in a better situation, and it clicks.” A popular example: Monta Ellis, derided as an empty-calories loser before emerging in Dallas as a pick-and-roll destroyer. Ellis’s evolution was overstated in some corners; he had always been a skilled driver whose passes led to layups and 3s, and he remained a woeful defender with the Mavs. But Dallas bet that Ellis would look better attacking within the spacing Dirk Nowitzki provides, and the Mavs were right. Numbers tell you a lot, but the process behind those numbers — the “how” — is the most important predictor for how a player will fit on a new team. There is no shortcut to making that kind of determination. You have to watch the film, watch it in the right ways, and do deep background work on a player’s character: his work ethic, what he cares about, his relationships with coaches and teammates. It’s not much different than scouting college players who won’t get to shoot as much in the NBA. “Every NBA player was a star in college,” Rockets GM Daryl Morey says, “and they’re almost all going to be role players here.” Executives with good teams are happy to sit through a reel of Harris jumpers, but they’re really watching to see what Harris contributes when he’s not shooting. Myers focuses on the last six minutes of close games3 and watches for specific sorts of non-shooting plays. “I’m looking for guys who make winning defensive plays,” he says. “Do they take charges? Do they win 50-50 balls? We want to find players that don’t just want to win, but really hate to lose. Like, if we’re playing Monopoly, and I land on Park Place before you, do you just say, ‘Life goes on, I’m getting a beer’? Or do you get really pissed?” Roster context also matters. The Bucks knew Carter-Williams was forcing awful shots on a borderline D-League team in Philadelphia, so when they considered trading for him, they isolated his performance alongside the veterans Philadelphia gradually sloughed off: Spencer Hawes, Thaddeus Young, and Evan Turner. Harris’s fans around the league argue he is not operating on that sort of empty roster, and that his numbers — 17 points per game on 47 percent shooting — are more legit. “There aren’t just numbers sitting there to be had on Orlando,” says one GM who wished to remain anonymous, because he was talking about another team. “There are enough scorers and rebounders there. Orlando isn’t Philly.” But what about the “how” behind Harris’s numbers? ??? Here is what Harris’s critics see when they think about him:  That’s Harris jacking a triple outside the corner, an area from which he shot just 31 percent, as Nikola Vucevic rolls free to the rim with 13 seconds left on the shot clock.  That’s Harris pulling the same thing, looking off a wide-open Victor Oladipo at the top of the arc with 14 seconds left on the shot clock. Harris has a quick trigger, but he’s not accurate enough to justify jacking long jumpers early in the shot clock. His shot selection rankled some within the Magic organization. Harris knows he should make the extra pass more often — assuming he sees them in the first place. “I have to get better at reading that,” Harris says. “But more times than not, I feel I can make my shots. That’s just the confidence I have in my game.” Harris shot an outstanding 44 percent on corner 3s last season, but he wants to extend his range to longer triples outside the corner. Harris spends a lot of time spotting up around Oladipo and Elfrid Payton pick-and-rolls, and defenders drift far from him to clog driving lanes.4  That will slowly change if Harris’s uptick from deep last season proves lasting; he already felt some defenders paying closer attention. “Some teams definitely hugged up on me more,” Harris says. “And some teams still backed way off.” Harris toggles between both forward spots, and improved shooting would be especially useful when Scott Skiles slots him at power forward in small-ball groups. If Harris becomes a real threat from long range, he could drag one opposing big-man defender away from the paint — uncluttering it for Payton and Oladipo. Harris spends a lot of practice time shooting 3s off the dribble, even though he’ll rarely do that in games. Shooting off the bounce is harder, and if he can master that, shooting off the catch “should be money,” Harris explains. Harris and Skiles have already spent time together at the team’s practice facility, and Harris says Skiles has promised to let him run more pick-and-rolls — a change that could juice up his assist numbers. Harris laughed off the idea that he holds any grudge toward Skiles for mostly nailing him to the bench during their time together in Milwaukee. “We never had any problems,” Harris says. “He pushes me hard. I’m ready for that. When I heard the news we hired him, my first reaction was, ‘I’m excited.’” But giving Harris the reins won’t help if he keeps doing this:  Harris has a chance to move right into a quick-hitting pick-and-roll with Vucevic, but he pauses and gives the defense time to set itself. Those moments of hesitation dot Harris’s game,5 and those blips can kill possessions in a league that is increasingly about flinging the ball from side to side. Instead of using Vucevic’s screen and slicing down the middle, Harris drives away from it and into the open pocket of space along the baseline — right where Indiana can fence him in. That’s a bad habit Harris leans on too often; he veered away from the screen on about 25 percent of his pick-and-rolls, one of the league’s 10 highest rates, per Synergy Sports. That’s not all on Harris; defenders stray far from Harris and Oladipo, turning the paint into a forest of swiping arms. The good passing lanes get clogged, and the open guys are mostly awful shooters. Still: Harris has to mix things up. “I need to be more unpredictable,” he says. Meanwhile, executives who are bullish on Harris see things like this:  Kick him the ball against a scrambled defense and Harris is deadly. He’s also a quick decision-maker. He has the reputation of a ball-stopper, but Harris mostly keeps the offense moving. He’s not Carmelo Anthony, stalling out the offense with endless jab steps, and that bodes well for his ability to fit in a modern NBA offense:  Harris can score when he gets going downhill on the pick-and-roll:  He has a nice change-of-pace game, and he rises up for nifty floaters. And the dude can get you a bucket:  That’s Kawhi freaking Leonard. Critics wonder what position Harris plays, but his versatility is a big part of his value. He can drive past power forwards and bully wings; Harris shot 51 percent on post-ups last season, per Synergy, one of the best marks in the league. He can do a little bit of everything on offense. He just needs to do less of the bad things and more of the good things — to trade a few bad jumpers for passes that keep the offense chugging. Whether he can do that is the biggest question surrounding his game. Harris just got paid, and there is a school of thought among league sources that with money in the bank, he might be a little less greedy on offense. He only turned 23 last week. If he passed more, perhaps Harris could be a score-first version of Draymond Green — a jack-of-all-trades who spaces the floor and works mismatches. Others are skeptical that a good numbers/bad team player can change on a dime. “Guys don’t change,” one GM says. “You either have that [unselfishness] in you, or you don’t. You don’t care about contract years.” If he can’t refine his passing skills, Harris may top out as an elite bench scorer who can dominate the ball on second units — and someone the Magic might eventually try to trade. A team can’t know the future, but a deep background check can at least provide a sense of whether a player cares enough to change his game. Even Harris’s critics laud his work ethic. He’s an avid film-watcher, he’s in the gym constantly, and he pays careful attention to his diet. “We wholeheartedly believe in his work ethic and his makeup,” Hennigan says. “We’re always going to bet on those things.” That’s a defensible bet, and given Harris’s tantalizing skill set, it’s a better bet than the opposite kind: Overpaying a guy in part because he played on a winning team. Harris will earn about as much per season as Aron Baynes, Cory Joseph, and Matthew Dellavedova combined, but Harris is the one guy among them who could change a franchise. ??? Harris’s boosters recognize he has more ground to cover on defense, where his “tweener” status hurts most. When he’s at small forward, he faces a speed deficit against opposing wings. And he hasn’t shown the killer ferocity any small-ball type needs to bang with power forwards. If Harris can’t defend either position, what exactly is he? “The next phase of his development is to make a tangible imprint answering that question,” Hennigan says. “Right now, he’s more productive on offense, but I think he’s motivated to do it.” Harris has an upright defensive stance that makes him look flat-footed, stuck in cement, against quicker wings. He falls behind when chasing guys over screens, and he’s vulnerable to blow-bys when lurching toward shooters; he can’t stay in front of Marcus Morris after recovering toward the right corner here:  “I watch film of myself, and I’m like, ‘Damn, I’m up pretty high,’” Harris says of his stance. He needs to crouch down so he can slide faster side-to-side, and he’s hired a yoga instructor to help loosen his hips. “They are really tight,” Harris says. “But the yoga has helped. I can already get a little lower.” At the same time, he’s working with Orlando’s strength coach to get stronger so he can battle with bulkier power forwards. Extra power will help, but some of those scrums come down to simple effort. If you’re at a size disadvantage, you have to work your ass off boxing out Tristan Thompson–types on every possession. “The biggest difference playing power forward is the toll it takes on your body,” Harris says. “That’s something I’m preparing my body for now.” You have to bring the fire every second you’re on the floor. Harris hasn’t always done that; he’s taken just two charges over his four seasons, per data provided by Stats LLC. A lot of guys have flopped their way into more charges than that. Harris got better last season. He was more diligent getting back in transition after years of admiring his own wayward jumpers while his guy leaked out. As the league get smaller, Harris will face more power forwards his size. And when Harris dials up the intensity, he can hang with crafty wing ball handlers; watch him switch onto Dwyane Wade and stick step-for-step with him on a crunch-time possession:  That right there — that fluid bit of positional versatility — is why Harris almost got a max contract. It is the “how” you’d bet big on — if you think it’s something Harris can replicate. He swears he can bring that kind of defense more often. “You look at my on-ball defense, and it’s not bad,” Harris says. “If you say I don’t play defense, that’s an insult. I put in my effort every night. Guys are not straight dogging me out there. It doesn’t happen.” Harris generally gets where he needs to be, and when, within Orlando’s help scheme, though he can get turned around if an enemy offense moves the ball fast enough. He has been a minus defender so far, but he hasn’t exactly had a stable NBA career. He started as a benchwarmer on Milwaukee teams lacking veteran leadership, and he fell in and out of favor with two different Orlando coaches. He has flipped almost haphazardly between positions, in all sorts of crazy lineups. Provide a bit more stability, and Harris might flourish. Skiles will demand accountability on defense, and his last Milwaukee teams flashed the kind of side-to-side ball movement that became even more in vogue after the Bucks fired him. The ball got sticky in Orlando last season, and the team hopes that will change under Skiles. The Magic will be an interesting team this season, but they are most intriguing with the Aaron Gordon–Harris pairing of positionally ambiguous hybrid forwards. Gordon is a bouncy defender learning to shoot more, and Harris is a score-first guy working to refine his defense. They could switch almost anything on defense and use their speed to punish teams on the other end. The Magic will be hurting for rim protection with Vucevic at center, but Dewayne Dedmon might be the only traditional big on the roster who brings that skill. Dedmon has hooves for hands,6 and pairing him with Vucevic was the final death blow for Orlando’s already shaky spacing. Getting funky with the Harris-Gordon duo might be Orlando’s best path toward solid two-way play. “Teams would have to pick their poison,” Harris says. It would certainly be the most entertaining. “This team could be really good,” Harris says. “It’s only a matter of time.” That’s in part up to Harris. He has his warts, but look closely, and you can see the profile of a player who could flourish in the modern NBA. The Magic were smart to wager on that upside. Now they and Harris must work together to bring it out.",2015-07-21T09:04:33+00:00,NBA,Lowe
119,Ty Lawson Ready to Launch in Houston,"As Houston soared to the conference finals, exposing the thin Clippers, it was almost hard to explain how the Rockets were doing it. They of course had James Harden, one of the half-dozen best players in the league, but Harden never quite reached ludicrous speed as the Rockets snatched the Clippers’ soul. They had Dwight Howard, once an MVP candidate, but Howard alone couldn’t prop up a defense that turned rickety in all three of Houston’s playoff series. The hellhound atop that defense, Patrick Beverley, was injured, leaving Jason Terry and Pablo Prigioni — senior citizens in the NBA — to chase some of the league’s greatest point guards. Their crunch-time playbook was a one-page doodle of Harden dribbling, in part because Donatas Motiejunas, a legit post-up threat who can sort of shoot free throws, was also injured. Houston jacked a ton of 3s, but it didn’t shoot them well, and teams clogged the lane by sagging off of everyone but Trevor Ariza. And yet, there they were in the Final Four, going toe-to-toe with the Warriors at Oracle Arena. Houston didn’t have some of the big-picture indicators we’d associate with an elite team, but the Rockets were just freaking relentless. They played at a frantic, exhausting pace. Everywhere you looked, there was an athlete ready to catch a pass from Harden, pump fake, drive to the rim on a blow-by, and kick out to the next shooter in the chain. It almost didn’t matter that Houston wasn’t a great shooting team; all that attacking produced the best kinds of shots — free throws, layups, and corner 3s on which the Rockets shot a robust 39 percent in the regular season, per NBA.com. Ty Lawson, who was acquired from the Nuggets on Sunday, fits right into a system that is both frenetic and mathematically sound. On the surface, he’s an average 3-point shooter who needs the ball and can’t defend; how could he coexist with Harden, who effectively plays point guard — and does so better than Lawson? That’s a fair question, and it’s possible Houston will bring Lawson off the bench once he gets his head right and serves whatever suspension the league levies. And it should go without saying that all of this basketball analysis is secondary. Anyone who allegedly drives drunk, repeatedly, is a public menace one more bad move away from killing someone. Stop it. Beverley’s combination of shooting and elite defense is a better theoretical fit next to Harden, even though Harden decided to start trying again on the defensive end last season. But let’s not pretend Beverley is Kyle Korver. He has shot a lower percentage from deep for his career than Lawson. Beverley chucked at a higher volume, but you can bet Lawson will let it fly from deep as a Rocket. Lawson and Harden are going to play a ton together regardless, and it should work well on offense — even as Harden retains undisputed alpha-dog status. Lawson led the league in drives per game in 2013-14 and finished third last season — four spots ahead of Harden, per SportVU tracking data.1 He is a roadrunner in transition for a fast-breaking team with speed at every position. For the low, low price of four fringe players and a lottery-protected first-round pick, the Rockets just combined two of the very best drive-and-kick players in the league. You thought Houston was exhausting to defend last season? The Rockets just souped up the engine. Sure, Lawson “needs” the ball, but that doesn’t mean he’s ineffective in a secondary role. He’ll touch it plenty; Harden sucks entire defenses toward him as he dribbles up high on the pick-and-roll, and if he spots Lawson’s defender tiptoeing into the paint, Harden can whip the ball to his new teammate. Give Lawson a head start like that, and you’re toast. Diversity is healthy, anyway. Houston badly needs a secondary creator so that Harden can play fewer minutes and do less heavy lifting when he’s on the floor. He can be a capable spot-up shooter, too. Houston’s offense died all season with Harden on the bench. Things got especially embarrassing in the conference finals, when Golden State outscored the Rockets by 36 points in the 41 minutes Harden rested, per NBA.com. The series was almost dead even with Harden on the court, and if Lawson commits, Houston should be able to at least survive when Harden sits. Lawson can carry second units even if he starts, provided Kevin McHale staggers minutes properly. The driving and passing lanes won’t be as clean as Daryl Morey would like until Houston acquires a legitimate stretch power forward, but both Motiejunas and Terrence Jones are creeping toward the arc. And even if they never get there, both are capable of catching around the elbows and making plays off the dribble. The machine keeps moving. That Houston nabbed Lawson without surrendering any of Jones, Motiejunas, and Clint Capela is a freaking coup. Capela proved in the playoffs he’s ready to contribute as an über-athletic pick-and-roll dive guy, and Houston has quietly assembled a really nice group of 25-and-under players to complement its foundational stars. There will be issues on defense, of course. Lawson is an undersize liability, and if Houston chooses to hide him at times on spot-up guys like J.J. Redick and Danny Green, Lawson will occasionally lose them as they scamper around the floor. If the Lawson-Harden combination proves untenable, that’s OK. Lawson can still play massive minutes off the bench, and $12 million for a super-sub will look less ridiculous assuming the cap soars toward $110 million over the next two years. Beverley’s four-year, $23 million is a steal even for a plus bench guy, and Houston will experiment with playing Beverley, Lawson, and Harden together against some backup units. Houston didn’t play much small ball last season, but with Lawson, K.J. McDaniels, and Corey Brewer onboard, the Rockets have enough pieces to shift Ariza to power forward when they need to juice up the spacing. The Rockets are honestly pretty loaded at every position. Signing both Sam Dekker and Montrezl Harrell will take Houston right to the tax line, but the Rockets could easily get under it by the end of the season — if they even care. Houston has punted on some potential cap space for next summer’s free-agency bonanza, but Lawson is better than any player the Rockets were likely to sign. As I wrote two weeks ago in wrapping free agency, next summer’s class is wildly overrated after Kevin Durant and Al Horford. There aren’t nearly enough All-Star–level players to absorb all the All-Star–level salary slots that will suddenly flow into the system as the cap jumps. It will be a great time to be Jeff Green. And right now is exactly when you want to acquire Lawson — with two years left on an old-cap contract that will expire before he turns 30. [Update: Sources tell Grantland that, as a condition of the trade, Lawson agreed to modify his contract so that the $13.2 million he’s due in 2016-17 is now fully nonguaranteed. If things don’t go well, the Rockets could simply let him walk after this season.] Lawson’s drinking has never been a secret. It was a concern for teams when he came out of North Carolina, and Denver officials have long kept an eye on his nighttime behavior. It turned off suitors, including Boston, at the trade deadline, when Denver was demanding two first-round picks in exchange for Lawson, per several league sources. A little guy who likes to party and relies a ton on speed is a huge risk once he passes his prime. Paying Lawson big on his next contract will be dicey unless he cleans up his act. Houston doesn’t have to worry about that, and in the meantime, the Rockets have John Lucas in their backyard to guide Lawson through the post-rehab phase of his life. This is how you maximize a championship window, which can close in a snap as contracts get shorter and shorter.2 Howard already has a player option after next season, and he’ll clearly never be the same two-way destroyer he was during his peak in Orlando. Houston needs to go for it now, and the Rockets have given themselves an honest chance to compete with San Antonio, Golden State, and Oklahoma City atop the West. Oh my god, the West. If they re-sign Howard, Jones, and Motiejunas, they’ll even be capped out in July of 2017, when the cap is expected to reach at least $108 million, but all of Houston’s guys should make for intriguing trade pieces should the Rockets seek an upgrade. They’re giving up almost literally nothing here. Kostas Papanikolaou shot 35 percent last season. Joey Dorsey is not an NBA player, and Prigioni is hanging on at age 38. The Rockets will always have the memory of Prigioni’s glorious series of picked pockets in Game 7 against the Clippers, when he basically iced the L.A. collapse. It was never getting any better than that for Prigioni in Houston, and there would be no minutes for him on a team with both Lawson and Beverley. Farewell, you sweet sneak. Nick Johnson has some potential, but he shot poorly in both Houston and the D-League, and he clashed with the Rockets coaching staff in Rio Grande, per several league sources. The 2016 first-round pick Houston flipped to Denver is lottery-protected, and if Houston picks in the mid-20s again, it won’t be much better than the unprotected 2017 second-rounder Denver sent along with Lawson. The Nuggets aren’t going to be good this season, and unless they nail every move between now and October 2016, they will be underdogs to make the playoffs in 2016-17. That second-round pick might land somewhere around no. 40, and you know the Rockets will make the most of it. It is not a random throw-in. The two teams haggled over that pick. It is a real cost for Denver and represents just how far Lawson’s trade value plummeted after his second arrest last week on suspicion of DUI. Denver could have drawn a line in the sand at that second-round pick, and I’m betting that Houston, despite what was undoubtedly some tough talk, would have eventually caved. But maybe not. At this moment, Denver was not getting a better package for Lawson. It’s easy to read that and conclude that, duh, Denver picked the wrong moment to trade him. Lawson’s value will never be lower; Morey has made a classic stock market buy-low play and stolen Lawson. Denver overplayed its hand at the trade deadline, even knowing that Lawson was a ticking time bomb, and it is paying the price today. All that is fair, but reality is more complicated. Denver couldn’t have known in February that Lawson would get into this much trouble, or that he’d post a video on Twitter in which he smoked a hookah and predicted a reunion with George Karl in Sacramento — a silly thing that nonetheless turned off potential trade partners. Look around the league: Who exactly needs a starting point guard and cares enough about winning over the next two seasons to deal with Lawson? The Lakers were the only other team to express interest, but they can’t offer a first-round pick until 2020 at the earliest — and may not have even put a future first-rounder on the table, per league sources. They should be giving minutes and touches to D’Angelo Russell and Jordan Clarkson, anyway. The Nets have a need, but they just ducked under the tax, they’re poor on picks, and they are hoarding cap space for next summer. Dallas got Deron Williams on the cheap, and between Lamar Odom and Rajon Rondo, the Mavs might just about be done taking on dudes with heavy baggage. New York excised its own problem children last season and needs the cap room for another run in free agency. Karl loves Lawson, but he’s not calling the shots in Sacramento, and the Kings just dealt all their best stuff to Philly. The Jazz could have gone all in for a short-term upgrade, but they believe in Dante Exum, and they don’t want Lawson around their young players right now. Denver doesn’t, either. You can suggest that the Nuggets should have waited for Lawson to reestablish his value ahead of next season’s deadline, but they want to tidy up the locker room now around Emmanuel Mudiay, Jusuf Nurkic, Nikola Jokic, and the rest of their young guys. That’s why they overpaid Jameer Nelson, guaranteed Randy Foye’s deal, and sought out other high-character guys around the league. They decided it was best to cut bait with Lawson, and while that may not be the optimal decision in calculating terms, real life doesn’t always run on calculating terms. Spreadsheets can’t determine everything. Losing that second-rounder hurts, but Denver has extra picks coming from Memphis and Portland,3 plus the right to swap picks with the Knicks in the next draft. It’s possible they won’t need to exercise those rights, since New York might finish with a better record — and a lower pick — than Denver does. They’ve also opened a ton of cap room for next summer, and they have just enough right now to possibly work out a contract extension with Danilo Gallinari. Denver may have to overpay blah free agents next summer just to reach the mandatory team salary floor. This is going to be a long slog. Dealing Lawson for this return is disappointing, considering that the Nuggets mounted a PR campaign to get him into the All-Star Game just five months ago, but the paths to a better outcome were closed off — at least over the next few months — when news of Lawson’s arrest broke last week. Right or wrong, the Nuggets viewed keeping Lawson as a risk they were no longer willing to take. For Houston, dealing for Lawson was a small risk it couldn’t pass up.",2015-07-20T12:39:22+00:00,NBA,Lowe
120,Spirit of St. Louis: Todd Gurley Is Giving the Rams a Chance to Take Flight,"On yesterday’s Grantland NFL Podcast, Bill Barnwell asked me a question that at first seemed crazy. After we broke down Rams running back Todd Gurley’s latest stomping of an NFL defense, Barnwell wondered aloud if Gurley, three starts into his career, is already the best running back in football. It took me about two seconds to answer: Yeah, he is. Since Week 4 against the Cardinals, when his workload increased, Gurley has averaged a bonkers 6.4 yards on his 68 carries. He is one of 39 players since 1960 to have three straight games with at least 125 yards on the ground, and, again, those were his first three games as a starter. Jeff Fisher came out earlier this week and told the Associated Press that as good as Gurley has been, “We just can’t rely on Todd all the time.” I mean, you can try. Game flow is a factor (St. Louis was beat up by Washington in Week 2), but before Gurley was eased into the starting lineup following last November’s ACL tear, the Rams were rushing on 36 percent of their plays. Since Gurley arrived, it’s jumped to 50.6 percent. Only the Panthers are running more often. The results, despite Gurley’s healthy average, have been mixed. The Rams’ new-look offensive line is still very much a work in progress, and that progress has been stunted since starting guard Rodger Saffold went down against the Packers. That’s forced rookie Jamon Brown, who was already transitioning to guard after playing tackle in college, to switch sides as Garrett Reynolds has moved into the starting lineup.  When the Rams line up and try to push people around, there are still plenty of plays that end with Gurley getting hit behind the line of scrimmage. The entire line has its down moments, and the result can be a play like the one above against Cleveland. Since Week 4, the Dolphins are the only team averaging more yards per carry than the Rams, but Miami is also leading the league in yards before contact per rush. The holes are massive for Lamar Miller. Gurley isn’t getting as much help. The Rams are seventh — 3.4 yards before contact — in that time frame, and that’s even inflated by Gurley being an actual ghost.  No human is capable of making it through that hole. The beings that can make that run are Todd Gurley and Kurt Wagner — end of list. There’s reason to believe that the line should get better as we get deeper into the season. The right side consists of two rookies, center Tim Barnes is a former undrafted free agent who’s started 10 career games, and Greg Robinson is still just in Year 2. While that progress happens, though, first-year offensive coordinator Frank Cignetti is doing what he can to build running lanes into the Rams’ blocking schemes.  St. Louis got a couple chunks of yardage off this action on Sunday. With Reynolds blocking down on the nose tackle, Barnes loops around in an effort to get to the linebacker. It’s an alternative to using a combo block to accomplish the same thing, and it also creates a manufactured seam that a monster like Gurley can exploit. By getting the linebackers moving laterally, Gurley is allowed to use his ridiculous vision. Watch as he threatens to run inside of Barnes, pulling linebacker Tank Carder in a step. When Gurley bounces the play back outside, Carder is already caught in the wash, and his chance to make the play is gone.  Cignetti also gets a little wonkier in creating space. Everything about this play works the way the Rams drew it up. By sending Tavon Austin in motion, Cignetti pulls Ha Ha Clinton-Dix out of the box. As the line steps right, inside linebacker Nate Palmer goes with them, and with Lance Kendricks coming back across the formation to kick out Julius Peppers, there’s a bigger seam than Gurley needs.  All of these built-in running lanes help, but occasionally, they’re not even necessary. Gurley’s strength and speed — be advised: Do not arm tackle — are on a different plane, but what’s making this possible is his ability to make these plays his own. This is the same play as the one before, with Austin going in motion and Kendricks kicking out, but instead of cutting back to the left, Gurley sees a sliver of grass to the front side and chews it up before the Packers can close. As much fun as all of this is, Fisher is right. If the Rams are going to be a legitimate threat in the NFC, their offense has to be about more than Gurley and the running game. The occasional deep shot from Nick Foles is an element to reaching that offensive ceiling. With Gurley in the backfield, there should be some opportunities on the outside, just like the one Foles saw on a bomb to Kenny Britt against the Browns. The best way Gurley can influence the passing game, though, is obviously with play-action. One of the drawbacks to the amount of running the Rams have done with Gurley is that they’re barely using play-fakes as a way to move the ball. St. Louis has run only 10 play-action passes in the past four weeks after running 23 of them in Weeks 1 through 3. The difference is in how effective they’ve been. Before Gurley’s first start, the Rams had a 60.8 QBR on play-action throws. In Year 1 A.G. (After Gurley), it’s 94.4.  There are smaller, more efficient ways that the play-action game can show up. This little dump-off to Kendricks is a product of Green Bay’s linebackers tearing after Gurley as the action moves to the left. Play-action throws don’t always have to be deep plays that take advantage of the middle of the field, but boy, it’s nice when they are.  This play takes long enough to develop that the linebackers crashing toward the line of scrimmage don’t seem to be what’s ailing the Cardinals defense, but the response to Gurley sets off a chain reaction that eventually leads to a huge gain for Austin. With the linebackers stepping up, Patrick Peterson feels obligated to follow the tight end coming across the field about three steps farther than he should. As Peterson is pointing and crying for help, Austin sneaks behind him, and Foles — who really does throw a nice-looking deep ball — puts it on the money. I’d assume that Fisher would consider that play “not relying only” on Gurley, but in a way, it still is. When the Rams drafted Gurley 10th overall this spring, they envisioned him as the centerpiece of their offense, and we’ve already learned that he can be. Gurley’s workload — and the Rams’ rushing percentage — probably isn’t sustainable, but even if they choose to ease off the gas, Gurley can still be what drives the rest of the offense. The formula of Gurley, play-action throws, and the occasional deep shot is the best possible plan for an offense that has a limited passing game. If they can lean on their new superstar and start getting a bit closer to that offensive ceiling, this defense is good enough to make St. Louis a team that no one is going to want to see come January.",2015-10-29T15:40:42+00:00,NFL,Mays
121,NFL Week 6 Winners and Losers: The Dolphins Finally Unleash Their Stars and Philip Rivers’s Art Is Desecrated,"That’s more like it. Through four games, the Dolphins were a mess. A team that finished second in rushing DVOA last season was ranked 21st, with preseason favorite Lamar Miller averaging a paltry 3.54 yards per carry. Breakout candidate Ryan Tannehill ranked 32nd in QBR, three spots lower than turnover machine Jameis Winston. The monster pass rush that Miami was supposed to have with Ndamukong Suh and Cameron Wake was nowhere to be found, ranking last in sack percentage through Week 4. All of this was enough to get head coach Joe Philbin and defensive coordinator Kevin Coyle fired. Supporters of the move spun it as a way to salvage a season for a roster with a significant amount of talent, and one game in, that group has plenty of ammunition. Miami stomped Tennessee yesterday, but more importantly, it did so by looking like the team many expected to see this season. Miller shredded the Titans defense to the tune of 19 carries for 113 yards, and he did it without the benefit of a long run. Gains of 22, 20, 14, 11, and 7 helped pace a Miami offense that was hampered by a couple of Tannehill interceptions. Where the Dolphins truly dominated, though, was the other side of the ball. The carnage that Cameron Wake caused in Nashville rivaled any game he’s ever had. The 33-year-old defensive end abused rookie right tackle Jeremiah Poutasi for four sacks in the first half before the Tennessee offensive staff had seen enough. Jamon Meredith didn’t let Wake yank down Marcus Mariota again, but he did get caught for two holding penalties while trying to slow Wake down.  After the win, Wake tried to downplay what was different about the Dolphins. “We’re still the same team from Week 1,” he said, according to David J. Neal of the Miami Herald. “Same players with the same abilities. It’s playing consistently, playing together. Having enthusiasm and fun. That’s probably the difference. It’s not that the me today isn’t the me from two weeks ago. Other than the hamstring issue.” The truth about Miami is neatly packed into that quote. After the bye week, the hamstring issue that hampered Wake early in the season wasn’t a factor, and one of the game’s best pass-rushers was allowed to wreak his vintage form of havoc against a pair of overmatched tackles. But that somersault after Wake’s first sack was telling. So was the way everyone on the sideline had a hug or high five for interim head coach Dan Campbell. The Dolphins clearly weren’t responding to Philbin and Coyle any longer, but yesterday — whether it was because of a week off, a new voice, or some combination of the two — they looked like a team with renewed life. How long that lasts is a different story. This is still a flawed team with serious issues in the secondary, a banged-up offensive line, and a quarterback who must reach a different plane if Miami is serious about contending. But if the motivation for firing Philbin was allowing the Dolphins to salvage a season in which the AFC’s second wild-card spot looks up for grabs, then one game in, that plan is undeniably a success. Wake is right. The Dolphins are probably the same team from Week 1, but yesterday, they looked just different enough. Sam Greenwood/Getty Images Nuk Hopkins and Julio Jones have been the most dominant receivers in football this year, but their brands of “Ha ha, you think you can stop me — that’s cute” are decidedly different. Jones is a matchup nightmare, a physical marvel who lines up anywhere and everywhere and can alternate between speed and strength depending on which type of defender you want to offer as sacrifice. That’s not Hopkins. He wasn’t billed as a burner coming out of Clemson, and he isn’t one now. His flavor of unstoppable is the result of being open even when he’s not. Hopkins has reached the rare “Throw it. No, seriously, just throw it” plateau for a receiver. His catch radius is seemingly endless, and any ball he can scrape even with a fingertip ends up caught. In the fourth quarter yesterday, when Hopkins squeezed the rock against his helmet as he slid out of bounds, I couldn’t blame Jaguars coach Gus Bradley for throwing the challenge flag: There’s no way that play happened based on our understanding of science, the Jags were up four points, and an incompletion would have left Houston with third-and-13.  Then I remembered that DeAndre Hopkins is not beholden to the laws of nature. The play was upheld, and five plays later, Nuk put on another show in the back corner of the end zone to give the Texans a 17-14 lead. After forcing a three-and-out, the next Houston drive lasted only four plays, because that’s all Hopkins needed to burn Davon House on a beautiful double move down the left sideline to give the Texans a 10-point lead they wouldn’t relinquish. In the fourth quarter alone, Hopkins had five catches for 91 yards and two touchdowns. He was the deciding factor in a game that was hardly in hand before he let loose. Through six games, Hopkins is on pace for a ridiculous 139 receptions and 1,936 yards. His league-leading 89 targets (14 more than anyone else) help those numbers, but he’s dropped just two of those throws. Hopkins is a special sort of force these days. Just imagine what he could be with a little more stability at quarterback. With the Steelers defense doing its part against the Cardinals, the burden weirdly fell on the Pittsburgh offense to scrape together enough points to pull off one of the more impressive wins of the year. For a while, that didn’t look promising with Michael Vick at the helm. Vick was 3-of-8 for 6 yards — six! — before leaving the game with a hamstring injury, which actually turned into a blessing for the Steelers.  Landry Jones’s postgame attire easily pegs him as a guy who didn’t expect to play yesterday, but the former Oklahoma quarterback made the most of his chance. Jones was 8-of-12 for 168 yards and two scores, including the 88-yard dagger to Martavis Bryant to put the Cardinals away for good. Before that jaunt came a soaring catch in the back of the end zone.  For the second straight week, the Steelers barely squeaked out a win, but with the NFL’s current leader in QBR still wearing a headset on the sideline, that’s all anyone can really ask. After Ben Roethlisberger injured his knee, the Steelers have held on against a dangerous Rams team, lost to the Ravens on a Thursday night (which barely counts), beaten the Chargers in San Diego, and knocked off the Cardinals. This is a team that’s now 4-2 with one of the league’s best quarterbacks injured for most of the year. With Roethlisberger possibly coming back next week against Kansas City, the Steelers are entrenched on the inside track for a wild-card spot. Bill Barnwell wrote this morning about how this surprising Steelers defense has kept them alive during this stretch, but yesterday was just another reminder of where the offense’s ceiling exists if the pieces are intact. With Roethlisberger, Antonio Brown, and Le’Veon Bell, Pittsburgh already had the makings of a lethal passing attack (just ask the Niners), and now Bryant is back in the picture. Losing wildly overlooked left tackle Kelvin Beachum to a torn ACL is a major blow, but with a full arsenal of skill-position players, this still has a chance to be one of the more potent offenses around. The moment Roethlisberger hit the turf in St. Louis, it felt like the Steelers’ season could be over, but somehow, they look ready to make a run. Coming into the season, there were some people (including this guy) who thought the various quarterbacks of the AFC were in for a world of trouble against the Buffalo defense. Rex Ryan had consistently trotted out top-10 units as the Jets head coach, and with Kyle Williams, Jerry Hughes, Mario Williams, and Marcell Dareus, there was a chance this was his most talented group to date. Through five weeks, the Buffalo defense was solid — 10th in DVOA, ninth against the pass — but not nearly the unit many envisioned before the season. A tough schedule is part of that. According to Football Outsiders, the Bills faced the sixth-toughest slate in the league in their first five games, and that was before they played the second-ranked Bengals. Still, a team with that much talent up front ranked a disappointing 24th in run-defense DVOA, and the terrifying pass rush we expected just hasn’t been there. Before yesterday, the Bills ranked 29th in pressure rate. Only the Cowboys, Eagles, and Falcons had gotten after opposing quarterbacks less often. The Bengals added to those struggles when Andy Dalton came away with a clean sheet — no sacks, no hits — while throwing for 243 yards and three touchdowns. Buffalo’s run defense wasn’t much better. The Cincinnati running backs gained 106 yards on their 24 carries for an average of 4.4 yards a pop, and Jeremy Hill seemed to have a little more burst than he’s had most of the season. To make matters worse, Bills mainstay Kyle Williams had to be helped off the field in the second half, and his knee injury is bad enough that he’s already been ruled out for Buffalo’s game against the Jags in London next week. The Bills are still better than most of the defenses throughout the league, but with so much uncertainty on offense — EJ Manuel started yesterday, so even the occasionally spectacular play from Tyrod Taylor wasn’t available — this is a team that needed to stonewall opponents on a weekly basis to make a push for the playoffs. That just hasn’t happened, and as injuries like the ones to safety Aaron Williams1 and Kyle Williams continue to mount, their postseason chances are getting even slimmer. We should start a petition that forces the Ravens to release Steve Smith Sr. and prevent any team but the Panthers from signing him. Right now, Baltimore doesn’t deserve him. The 36-year-old Smith, playing with broken bones in his back, finished yesterday’s loss to the 49ers with seven catches for 137 yards, including an obscene 34-yard touchdown that shouldn’t be possible at this point in his career.  Apart from Smith, the Ravens are a mess. Even behind that offensive line, Baltimore is still having trouble moving the ball on the ground (77 yards on 22 carries). Colin Kaepernick, who has looked lost for much of the season, needed just 16 completions to get his 340 yards. Saying the 1-5 Ravens could be winless is true, but with all six of their games being decided by six points or fewer, it’s just as valid to say they could be 3-3 or 4-2. The issue with Baltimore is that in very few of those games did it appear as if it did anything well. The pass rush has disappeared for long stretches without Terrell Suggs and a banged-up Elvis Dumervil, the secondary is still prone to massive miscues, and the offense doesn’t appear capable of much unless it’s playing the Raiders or Browns. The Ravens are in trouble, and there’s no reason to believe they will get much better. Philip Rivers: 1st QB to throw for 500 yards and 0 INT whose team lost the game — ESPN Stats & Info (@ESPNStatsInfo) October 19, 2015  Rivers earns inclusion here only because yesterday was another installment of his career as a tragic figure. It’s been a long time since Aaron Rodgers was the lesser quarterback in a game at Lambeau Field, but he was Sunday. Rivers was simply magnificent against the Packers — his 503 passing yards were the 15th-highest single-game total in NFL history — and he did it all as part of a makeshift offense. For the third straight week, 60 percent of the Chargers’ offensive line consisted of backups. Rivers was hit 13 times, and although his 68 dropbacks contribute to that number, it’s safe to say that Rivers spent most of the day with the pocket crumbling around him. And yet again, the Chargers ended the game without their two best receivers: Keenan Allen was a force before spending the fourth quarter bundled up on the sideline, and with Stevie Johnson already hurt, that left Rivers with Dontrelle Inman, Malcom Floyd, and his two tight ends. Turning to the run wasn’t much of an option, either — not after Melvin Gordon put the ball on the ground twice and was sent to the bench.  Picking a favorite throw from the bunch isn’t easy. In a second half in which Rivers was 21-of-33 for 292 yards and a score, there are a dozen to choose from. But I think I’ve landed on this one, a 17-yard gain on second-and-18 that sees Rivers have to pull the ball down, escape two rushers, and somehow float the ball to Floyd. The drive ended in a Chargers field goal after Rivers tossed a back-shoulder throw to Inman that was never close. Those are plays that require both timing and familiarity, neither of which Rivers has with his third-string receiver. Rodgers won’t be tossing Rivers sympathy anytime soon, not with Jeff Janis as his no. 1 target yesterday. But for the second straight season, Rodgers is playing with the majority of his offensive line intact. Year in and year out, it feels like Rivers is forced to perform with an offense held together with safety pins and duct tape. But every so often, that doesn’t matter. He’s still good enough to put together extraordinary performances like the one we saw at Lambeau yesterday. And when that potential game-tying throw to Danny Woodhead fell incomplete, no one could blame Rivers for his reaction.  Go ahead, Phil. Take a minute. You earned it this time.",2015-10-19T16:13:51+00:00,NFL,Mays
122,"NFL Week 5 Winners and Losers: Odell Beckham Jr., Von Miller, Jamaal Charles, and More","Giants guard Geoff Schwartz usually does a silent roll call of the entire offense on the first play of every drive. It’s an ideal time for a broad look at the game, as assignments take a brief backseat to situation. That, he says, is when he notices which wide receivers are in the huddle. And as Schwartz surveyed the pass-catchers before the Giants’ final drive, there were some new faces staring back at him. “I’m like, ‘Oh yeah … we’ve got some young guys in there,’” Schwartz said after Sunday night’s win over the Niners. The young guys were Myles White and Geremy Davis, who’ve combined for four more career catches than Odell Beckham Jr. had last night. Beckham was on the sideline when the final drive began, with the Giants trailing San Francisco, 27-23, and 1:41 left. He’d tweaked one of his problematic hamstrings “five or six plays” before scoring a touchdown late in the third quarter, and he hadn’t been on the field since. Waiting for him on the bench was Rueben Randle, who was dealing with a hamstring issue of his own. With the Giants down four points and their two best receivers, Beckham says he had a message for running back Shane Vereen as the offense took the field. “I told him, ‘You have to put the team on your back. Somebody has to do it,’” Beckham says. “He stepped up big, not that it surprised me.” As soon as a reporter mentioned Vereen’s name, Beckham started shaking his head. Tom Coughlin had the same response during his press conference. In just five games, the Giants have learned what the Patriots already knew: Vereen is one of the NFL’s unique talents, a running back that can serve as the centerpiece of a team’s passing game if the situation calls for it. Without Beckham and Randle, that situation arrived Sunday, and of the 82 yards on the Giants’ game-winning drive, Vereen contributed 51 on three catches. Vereen’s second catch of the drive was a 16-yard gain that took the Giants past midfield. On the very next play, an Eli Manning pass sailed into the arms of a diving Tramaine Brock, seemingly dashing the Giants’ hopes and costing them a win against the reeling Niners. But as soon as the replays hit the video board in MetLife Stadium, it was clear the Giants still had life. There was only one way the news could get any better during that review, and it did when no. 13 trotted back into the huddle. Coughlin said Beckham had been lobbying to come back into the game, and after he was cleared by the medical staff, Coughlin relented. It took one play for Beckham to make a difference. The pass interference penalty he drew on Kenneth Acker down the left sideline took the Giants within striking distance with just 26 seconds on the clock. It wasn’t the first time Beckham victimized Acker last night. It was Acker who Beckham spun into the turf as he reversed field and sauntered into the end zone for that third-quarter score. All game, there were reminders of how many different ways Beckham affects the contest. He torched a cornerback on a deep route down the sideline that would have been a touchdown with a better throw. He chewed up the San Francisco secondary on slants and short in-breaking routes. Even at (a generously listed) 6-foot, Beckham can be whatever type of receiver on any given play. And on his way to a seven-catch, 121-yard day, he was every kind imaginable. Elsa/Getty Images Beckham got a lot of attention Sunday night (he was targeted 11 times), but when he was looking to put the game away, Manning took aim at a slightly bigger target. After Larry Donnell used his helmet to cradle a pass that whizzed past NaVorro Bowman’s ear, he fell back onto the turf while squeezing the ball so tightly that it looked like it might actually pop. The throw capped the 27th time Manning has led the Giants to a regular-season win after trailing in the fourth quarter. “It says we’ve got a better quarterback than a lot of people think,” Vereen said of Manning’s final drive. “We love him, we trust him, we follow him. He’s our leader.” Manning was far from flawless. He threw a bad interception late in the first half and nearly did the same on a drive that ended with a 24-yard Josh Brown field goal. But without his top two receivers near the end, and without much from his running game, Manning still hung 30 points on a defense Coughlin insisted is better than San Francisco’s record shows. “Everyone wanted to talk about the three losses in a row,” Coughlin said. “I wanted to talk about Green Bay. They held Green Bay to 17 points.” Manning’s 41 completions and 54 attempts were both career highs, and he needed all of them. Losing to a 1-3 team is never fun, but with the rest of the NFC East stumbling, a win meant a chance for the Giants to get a small step ahead of their division mates. They didn’t look as impressive as they have in recent weeks, especially on defense, but their struggles against the run came in part because they were missing both Robert Ayers and Devon Kennard in the front seven. With players on both sides of the ball hurt and Colin Kaepernick looking better than he has at other points this year, it looked as if this one might be the sort of game that slips away from the Giants. But they managed to crawl their way to their third win. In the NFC East right now, that’s enough. One of the reasons some folks were so high on Philadelphia coming into the year was that the talent on the Eagles defense could carry them for stretches. And no one in that group has more talent than Fletcher Cox.  Cox plays all over the formation, but his strength is the ability to line up as a 3-technique tackle and go to work against overmatched guards. He dominated the interior of the Saints offensive line yesterday to the tune of three sacks, an additional tackle for loss, and two forced fumbles. The second turnover came early in the third quarter, just after Philadelphia had scored to take a 17-10 lead. On the first play of the drive, Cox dismantled Saints tackle Andrus Peat and dragged Drew Brees to the turf. The ball went spilling onto the ground before Cox pounced on it, giving the Eagles possession at the Saints’ 13-yard line. Sam Bradford tossed a touchdown on the very next play. It’s about as big of a two-play swing as any defender can have, and it was that sort of day for Cox. Not many human beings could get away with dressing like the Joker, but Miller is definitely the exception.  Some men just want to watch offensive tackles burn. It looks like Tyler Eifert is here to stay. The Bengals have offensive weapons all around Andy Dalton, but with A.J. Green sequestered to life outside the numbers against a Seahawks secondary that typically thrives there, Eifert became the focal point of the Cincinnati passing game. Seattle came into the game ranked 30th in DVOA against tight ends, and that shouldn’t get any better after yesterday. Eifert finished with eight catches for 90 yards and two touchdowns, but the most impressive part of his day was just how many ways Hue Jackson deployed him.  On the most crucial play of the game, with the Bengals needing a field goal and only 1:25 left, Eifert lined up as a tight end to the right side. He managed just enough separation on a corner route to make a tough throw for Dalton possible, before making a ridiculous sliding catch that put Cincinnati in field goal range. On his two touchdowns, the Bengals used Eifert in the slot on the left, where he worked the middle of Seattle’s defense to perfection. And on the first play of the game-winning drive in overtime, Cincy lined Eifert up wide to the left to give him room to work on a slant against a cornerback. This is the type of varied usage mostly reserved for the league’s true playmakers on offense, and at this point, it looks like Eifert might actually be one. With Green, Marvin Jones, that offensive line, and Gio Bernard looking better than he ever has, that’s a truly terrifying collection of players. For the most part, the Rams did all they needed to against the Packers. Green Bay’s run defense bottled up Todd Gurley on a majority of his carries, but when he tore off a 55-yarder early in the fourth quarter, it was still just an 11-point game. On that drive, the Rams managed to get the ball inside the 10 before Foles threw an ugly interception — his third of four on the day — to Ha Ha Clinton-Dix in the end zone. Foles would throw another on the Rams’ final drive, which mattered more to bettors than anyone else, but the truth is that without the miscues from Foles (and the missed field goals from Greg Zuerlein), St. Louis put together a viable bid to slay Aaron Rodgers at Lambeau Field. The Rams ended Rodgers’s nearly three-season streak of not throwing an interception at home and then added another for good measure. With right guard Rodger Saffold missing most of the game with a shoulder injury, some shuffling along the Rams offensive line meant Foles was under siege. The Packers hit Foles 12 times, but none of the horrendous interceptions were the result of an altered throw or a batted ball. Tight end Jared Cook deserves some of the blame for cutting his route short on the ugly pick-six by rookie Quinten Rollins, but that doesn’t explain away some of the other decisions Foles made. The Rams’ ability to stick with two of the league’s best teams in consecutive weeks is encouraging, but they have to know they let this one slip away.  Few teams made as many high-profile moves as the Bills this spring. The LeSean McCoy trade was a blockbuster deal, and along with the signing of Charles Clay, it looked like it would give Buffalo one of the more potent sets of offensive weapons in the AFC. The problem is that the team’s most glaring issue outside of quarterback went mostly unaddressed. The offensive line in Buffalo was an issue last year, and although the Bills signed Richie Incognito off the street and drafted Louisville guard John Miller in the third round, those were hardly a guaranteed fix. Much of the problem stems from what happened during last year’s draft. In trading up to get Sammy Watkins, Buffalo handed Cleveland its 2015 first-round pick, leaving the Bills with one fewer asset that could have been used to improve the group up front. Things were only exacerbated when Buffalo took former Alabama tackle Cyrus Kouandjio in the second round. According to Ian Rapoport, several team doctors gave Kouandjio a negative grade on his medical exam, with most of the concerns revolving around his surgically repaired knee. Whether the problem is health or simply ineffectiveness, Kouandjio has barely played, and that’s left 2014 seventh-round pick Seantrel Henderson as Buffalo’s best option at right tackle. Against the Titans, Henderson was routinely roasted for the second week in a row. This time, it was by Derrick Morgan, who’s finally having the breakout season everyone has been waiting for. Morgan had another 1.5 sacks yesterday, which gives him 4.5 on the season for a Tennessee defense that came into the game with the best pressure rate in football. Jurrell Casey added 1.5 sacks, and both he and Morgan drew holding calls on drives that ended with punts. Tennessee finished with four sacks and hit Tyrod Taylor five times. With Titans living in the backfield, Buffalo’s offense never got much going. Taylor finished 10-of-17 for just 109 yards, and Buffalo’s running backs combined for only 50 yards on 18 carries. Without Taylor’s game-saving 24-yard scramble and some baffling decision-making by Ken Whisenhunt, it’s likely the Bills would be 2-3. Taylor has been impressive at times, and getting all of their playmakers back to the field will help, but if the Bills can’t block anyone, who’s holding the ball only matters so much.  It feels like these things never actually work. Tavon Austin scored on a similar-looking play for the Rams, who probably needed even more gimmicks near the goal line, but the key difference was that with St. Louis in the shotgun, his motion across the formation was far less transparent. One quarter later, with the Rams facing a third-and-2 near midfield, Foles spun and handed the ball to a sprinting Austin, who was stuffed for no gain. St. Louis was content to hand the ball to Todd Gurley (approximately) 126 times yesterday but gave way to gadgetry on a crucial third-and-short.  It didn’t end up mattering after Johnny Hekker pulled off a fake punt to keep the drive going, but all over the league yesterday, it felt like speed sweeps and end-arounds were non-starters for offenses. The Bengals came into the game with the league’s best passing offense by DVOA — and most of what offensive coordinator Hue Jackson has done this season has been excellent — but on first-and-10, Cincinnati was content to hand the ball off to Rex Burkhead tearing across the field. The handoff went awry, and after taking one bounce on the turf, the ball landed squarely in the hands of Bobby Wagner, who took it 23 yards to the house. The Bengals eventually climbed out of the 17-point hole they’d dug, but that’s not the point. Throw these out, offensive coordinators. There has to be a better option. Keith Myers/Kansas City Star/TNS via Getty Images As soon as the replay came on, it was easy to tell how this ended. There was no one within a few yards of Jamaal Charles when he planted his right knee into the Arrowhead Stadium turf and instantly crumpled to the ground. As soon as I saw it happen, I reacted the only way you could: yelling “Oh no!” louder than someone should in public. The initial report is that Charles indeed has a torn ACL, for the second time in his career, and that he’ll be out for the rest of the season. Geoff Schwartz blocked for Charles for just one season in Kansas City, where the offensive guard built up his value and earned a nice long-term deal from the Giants. No one appreciates a great running back like his offensive linemen. Those are the guys who know that at times, a player like Charles makes them look great even on plays they’re not. “I think as an offensive line and a running back, you kind of work together. They can make us look good, and there are plays where it’s just blocked up well,” Schwartz told me. “But a guy like Jamaal, he can definitely make O-lines look good.” Charles is one of the more underrated backs in the NFL, but he’s also one of the more underrated backs in the history of the NFL. At this moment, Charles is still the league’s all-time leader among halfbacks in yards per carry at 5.5 yards per attempt, and at 5.1 this year, he was showing no signs of letting up. Those numbers tell a story. With his history of track success, Charles was billed as a burner coming out of Texas, but he’s actually the opposite of a boom-or-bust running back. DVOA is a per-play metric that, in part, measures efficiency on a given snap. Coming into yesterday, Charles ranked third. He finished second last season and seventh in 2013. He was 17th in 2012, but in the two seasons before his first ACL tear, he finished second and first. In the five seasons he’s finished as the Chiefs’ primary back, his average DVOA has been sixth. That’s remarkable considering the volume of work Charles gets in the Kansas City offense, but what’s even more remarkable is that he’s done almost all of that work without a premier offensive line. Pro Bowls are hardly the best measure of offensive line play, but since Charles came into the league, just two Chiefs offensive linemen have been sent to Hawaii. One of them — Brian Waters — hasn’t played for Kansas City since 2010. For the most part, the Chiefs line has been a constant shuffling of replaceable players. Barry Richardson was an NFL starter for just three seasons, two of them coming during Charles’s run. Center Casey Wiegmann, who started the entire 2010 and 2011 campaigns, was 38 years old that second season. Jeff Allen was a starter for two seasons before eventually losing his job. Continuity and exceptional talent have been a constant presence with the group blocking for Charles, but it’s never really mattered. Every year, Charles remains one of the two or three best running backs in football, all while serving as the Chiefs’ most potent threat in the passing game. Every time he touches the ball, it’s worth watching as he stops and starts in a way no one else can and makes something out of nothing better than few backs ever have. He’s a rare combination — a back that’s utterly thrilling while also being ruthlessly effective. The Chiefs aren’t the only ones who lost yesterday. We all did. This post has been updated to correct the name of the stadium where Jamaal Charles injured his knee. It was at Arrowhead Stadium, not Soldier Field.",2015-10-12T14:09:04+00:00,NFL,Mays
123,"Sinking Suh, Rising Ware, and a Bargain in Buffalo: Looking Back at the Recent Successes and Disasters of NFL Free Agency","If the 1-3 Dolphins continue this current slide, there will be plenty of cautionary tales to be told about Miami, but the worst — and most expensive — may come in the form of Ndamukong Suh. Through four games, Suh remains without a sack, and his one quarterback hit has him on pace for 20 percent of his 2014 total. Suh didn’t suddenly fall off a cliff — there are both personnel and schematic reasons he hasn’t been his old self — but the well-known problems that come with handing a single non-quarterback $60 million guaranteed have been obvious. Spending big money on Suh meant sticking with the status quo at linebacker and in weaker parts of the secondary. The same goes for the interior of the offensive line and at swing tackle, which could have used a slight upgrade. Suh’s production will eventually creep toward what we saw in Detroit, but the point, as it often is with free agency, is that the quick fix is rarely quick. Come next spring, when writers and fans alike get worked up by players changing locales, Suh seems likely to be used as cold water to pour over all the excitement. Yet the free-agent pool, when scoured rationally, has been pretty useful over the past couple of offseasons. Free agency isn’t quite a fool’s game: It can be played well. But when it isn’t? Eesh. ??? Justin Edmonds/Getty Images For the best-case scenario, look to Dove Valley, Colorado, where the undefeated Broncos are leaning on a 2014 free-agent class that might rival any we’ve ever seen. When free agency kicked off in 2014, the Broncos had just lost to the Seahawks in the Super Bowl. But while their defense ranked a respectable 15th in DVOA, the group offered a few areas for improvement, as it featured a couple of aging former starters (Shaun Phillips and Champ Bailey) and the solid-but-unspectacular Duke Ihenacho at strong safety. That spring, John Elway used that golden arm of his to throw a combined $59.5 million guaranteed at DeMarcus Ware, Aqib Talib, and T.J. Ward to take over those three spots. It might’ve taken a year longer than expected, but four weeks into this season, Denver comfortably ranks first in defensive DVOA, with all three playing meaningful roles. Ware, especially, once again looks like the player he did in Dallas — the one who was arguably the best defensive player in football at the end of the last decade. After finishing last season with 20 quarterback hits, he already has 12 through four weeks. Of course, the Broncos’ success is about a lot more than three players. Replacing Jack Del Rio with Wade Freaking Phillips — one of the best defensive minds in football, who, you know, just happened to be hanging out at home — is quite the break. Watching Brandon Marshall go from Jaguars castoff to Pro Bowl–caliber linebacker doesn’t hurt. And Von Miller remains one of the best players at any position in the league. Beyond Miller, the Denver defense is full of even more homegrown talent. Former fifth-round pick Malik Jackson is an underrated pass-rusher, nose tackle Sylvester Williams has come into his own, and cornerback Chris Harris Jr. continues to be one of the best undrafted finds in recent memory. Drafting and developing is always going to be paramount in building and maintaining a contender, but the Broncos are a perfect example of how strengths built in the draft can be supplemented with money spent in free agency. It doesn’t take a long trip down the defensive DVOA rankings to find another. The second-place Jets are just behind Denver, and so far, the way they’ve spent their free-agent money has worked as well as they could’ve hoped. Last season, Rex Ryan’s unit finished 11th in run-defense DVOA but ended up a disappointing 24th against the pass. With Darrelle Revis, Buster Skrine, Marcus Gilchrist, and Antonio Cromartie now in town, those numbers have evened out. The Jets rank in the top five against both the run (third) and pass (fourth), and Todd Bowles has built his defense to get the most out of its personnel. For a group without much edge pass-rushing talent, Bowles has cried havoc and let slip the [whatever farm animal] of war. He’s blitzing on a league-high 53.1 percent of opponent dropbacks, and that has helped produce the third-best pressure rate in football. With players like Revis on the back end, it’s a risk that Bowles can afford to take. And when the Jets have brought extra pressure, they’ve gotten big plays out of it. All six of their interceptions have come during blitzes, and no team is getting interceptions more often when bringing five or more rushers (7.1 percent of dropbacks). As for the other side of the ball, the Jets’ offensive line sports the best sack rate in the league, thanks in no small part to 2014 and 2015 offseason additions from Seattle Breno Giacomini and James Carpenter. Elsewhere, the Cardinals have also revived their O-line through free agency: Even after Carson Palmer faced the Rams’ firing squad of a front four last week, Arizona ranks seventh in sack percentage through four weeks, and 2014 signee Jared Veldheer looks to be worth every dollar of his five-year, $35 million deal. And back in the blue side of New York, Giants guard Geoff Schwartz, who was hurt for most of last season, has helped solidify a line that looks vastly improved this year. ??? Alex Goodlett/Getty Images Like Schwartz, Jon Asamoah was considered one of the better guards available in free agency last year. He got a five-year deal with $6 million guaranteed, but this offseason he was supplanted at right guard by 32-year-old Chris Chester, who is playing on a one-year deal. The Falcons’ 2014 class shows just how much of a mixed bag free agency can be: Atlanta handed out deals to Asamoah, Tyson Jackson, and Paul Soliai, and while the latter two are still playing significant snaps, the Falcons are actually getting bigger contributions on defense from afterthoughts signed to one-year deals this spring. O’Brien Schofield and Adrian Clayborn are making a combined $4.7 million this season, and both have made meaningful contributions to a much-improved Atlanta defense. Even worse in 2014 was Clayborn’s former team, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. A year after letting Michael Bennett, whose initial deal with Seattle remains one of the best free-agent bargains ever, walk, the Bucs spent big … and it all went to hell. A year after signing Michael Johnson, Anthony Collins, and Alterraun Verner, Johnson and Collins have both been cut and Verner has ceded most of his snaps to Tim Jennings, who was cut by the Bears, who are 31st in defensive DVOA through four games. This year, outside of Miami, the early front-runners for Tampa’s Worst Offseason title seem to be Chip Kelly and the Eagles. Philadelphia handed Byron Maxwell and DeMarco Murray a combined $46 million in guaranteed money, and so far, neither of those deals has panned out. As Bill Barnwell likes to often remind me on The Grantland NFL Podcast, the rub with free agency lies in opportunity cost. Even if the market dictates that Byron Maxwell is worth $63 million over six years because another team was willing to pay that much, the moves for him and Murray precluded the team from using that money elsewhere. If all offseason signings and non-signings are connected by a chain of opportunity cost, then hindsight becomes expressed in a nagging series of what-ifs. The Colts’ free-agent record has been as shaky as any team’s for the past few seasons. What if, instead of signing Andre Johnson to $10 million in guarantees, the Colts had given Pernell McPhee the $15.5 million he got from the Bears? And what if the Bears never cut Julius Peppers, who’s piling up sacks for an improved Packers defense, and replaced him with Jared Allen, who now plays for the Panthers? However, through four games, the weightiest what-if in the league is probably the one in Buffalo. This offseason, Tyrod Taylor was an overlooked member of a forgettable free-agent quarterback class. His three-year deal with the Bills came with $1.15 million in guarantees, putting him 46th among quarterbacks across the league. For context, backups Derek Anderson and Tarvaris Jackson each make more than him. What’s more important, though, is that the Texans gave Brian Hoyer a deal worth nearly three times as much as Taylor’s, and the one the Browns handed Josh McCown is worth more than four times as much. Coming off a rough outing against the Giants last week, it’s hardly the time to argue that Taylor is a star, but his play is giving the Bills a chance. And although Hoyer and McCown aren’t expensive by any means, the money that Buffalo saved on Taylor, comparatively, can be used to improve the rest of the roster. As we’ve seen so far this year, the evils of free agency are real, yet there are also gains to be made. But when the size of the victory looks too good and too big to be true, just ask the Dolphins: It probably is.",2015-10-08T15:26:00+00:00,NFL,Mays
124,NFL Week 4 Winners and Losers: The Disappearing Dallas Cowboys and the Emergence of Todd Gurley,"Tony Romo was only a couple of feet away, pulling on a sock with his one good arm, but the tone in Jason Witten’s voice made it sound like the Cowboys quarterback was nowhere to be found. Witten was fielding the most popular question in the Dallas locker room last night — the one that asked how he and the rest of the still-standing Cowboys would be able to improve upon a 2-2 start as the injuries mount. “We don’t look at it that way,” Witten said. “Ultimately, when you lose your two franchise players like Tony and Dez, it’s tough, but that’s what happens in this league.” It rarely happens like this, though. Star quarterbacks across the league — Ben Roethlisberger, Andrew Luck, and even Drew Brees — are either playing hurt or missing time, but at least the Steelers still have Antonio Brown. Luck should be back on Thursday. And when the Saints needed a game-winning drive in overtime, even a hampered Brees was better than not having him at all. Even Jerry Jones, speaking in a hushed tone just outside the Cowboys locker room about Brandon Weeden’s game-tying drive, was able to admit that his team and the Saints were in different hands last night. “It’s not quite apples and oranges when the guy on the other side of the deal is Brees and you’re dealing with a guy as limited as Weeden,” Jones said. “And we were.” Chris Graythen/Getty Images Trying to scrape together points without one of the league’s best quarterbacks and possibly its most physically dominant receiver was already a difficult road for the Cowboys, and it didn’t get any easier after Dallas lost two more parts of its makeshift offense. After picking up 54 yards on his three carries, Lance Dunbar was spun to the ground on a kickoff and fell back awkwardly on his knee. Jason Garrett said Dunbar will undergo further tests today, but Jones said it best about a play that made everyone watching wince with a simple “I don’t like it.” The Dunbar injury came after Brice Butler had to leave the game with a pulled hamstring. The Dallas receiving corps was down to Terrance Williams, fifth-round pick Devin Street, Cole Beasley, and a hobbled Witten, all fielding passes from Weeden. You’d think the Cowboys might be able to compensate by turning to the running game, which made them such a dominant unit a year ago, but it’s never that easy. Dallas finished fourth on offensive DVOA last season precisely because of the harmony between its running game and Romo and Bryant’s ability to break a defense’s will by extending drives. The Cowboys finished 3-of-12 on third down against one of the worst defenses in football last night. Moving the ball on the ground is always going to be a challenge for an offense without a viable deep threat. Joseph Randle finished with just 26 yards on his 11 carries after heading to the bench following his risky goal-line move, and Darren McFadden wasn’t much better. The Saints had safeties lurking around the line of scrimmage throughout the game, and even an offensive line as good as Dallas’s will struggle when losing the numbers game. At 2-2, the Cowboys are still tied for the lead in the NFC East, but anyone watching the Dallas offense for the past seven quarters knows how steep the climb is going to be without Romo and Bryant. “The good thing is that the guys who were out there, the ones we’re asking to step up — they shouldn’t be as good as the ones they’re replacing — but they’re playing hard,” Jones said. “And I’m really proud of them.” That’s a hollow victory for a team that came into the year dreaming of another playoff run. And with the Patriots and Seahawks looming, that might be the only type of win Dallas has for a while. AAron Ontiveroz/The Denver Post via Getty Images The game plan that Wade Phillips deployed yesterday — which I believe is called “unleash hell” — toed the line between effective and cruel. With DeMarcus Ware and Von Miller, Denver boasts maybe the best pass-rushers in football, but against a shaky, shorthanded Vikings offensive line, Phillips wasn’t going to let those guys have all the fun. The Broncos blitzed on exactly half of Minnesota’s dropbacks — the fourth-highest rate in the league so far this week — and the result was absolute havoc. Teddy Bridgewater was sacked seven times and hit 11 times overall, and a good portion of the damage was done by players in the back seven.  Safety T.J. Ward, who had two sacks last season, had two yesterday. Four games in, Denver now has 11 players with at least one. Only six other teams have at least 11 sacks total. Phillips’s unit is creating pressure on 37 percent of dropbacks, the third-best rate in football, and it’s finishing plays when it gets the chance. The Broncos are 4-0, and they’ve done it by leaning on what might be the best defense in football. Bruising Bridgewater is one thing, but Denver also made Adrian Peterson’s life miserable. Being Adrian Peterson, he managed a 48-yard score that helped keep Minnesota alive, but outside of that carry, he had just 33 yards the other 15 times he ran the ball. Right now, the Broncos are comfortably the best defense in the league by DVOA, and they look like a group without any noticeable holes at any position. Denver’s struggles on offense are very real, but this defense might just be good enough to overcome them. Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images J.J. Watt picked the right word yesterday when he told ESPN.com’s Tania Ganguli that the Texans’ performance in Atlanta was “pitiful.” Houston was a mess in almost every way on Sunday. Ryan Mallett was bad enough that Bill O’Brien eventually went back to Brian Hoyer, who put together some reasonable numbers during some of the filthiest garbage time you will see in an NFL game. Mallett couldn’t do much of anything against an improved but hardly intimidating Falcons defense. For the second time in three starts, he completed less than 50 percent of his passes, and for the third time in as many games, he failed to top six yards per attempt. Hoyer will be the answer in the short term, but there’s a reason it took this much time for O’Brien to send Mallett to the bench. Neither is an attractive option, and with Arian Foster still not ready to take on a full workload, Houston’s offense is going to struggle. And that’s not even the disheartening part of the Texans’ Sunday outing: The defense didn’t look much better. By the time Atlanta’s Terron Ward rumbled into the end zone to make it 42-0, the effort was all but gone. When you have an offense that can’t move the ball playing against a team that’s clicking in every way, games can understandably get out of hand, but it was hard to watch the Texans yesterday without thinking they’re in trouble. O’Brien did what he could to put the blame on himself. “I’m disappointed in me as a head coach,” O’Brien said. “That’s what I’m disappointed in, because I don’t think I did a good job today. It starts with me. To go out there and perform like that? That’s on the head coach.” Maybe, but the problems in Houston go far deeper than being unprepared. Until the quarterback situation is resolved, there’s a chance it’s enough to short-circuit the rest of Houston’s season. Christian Petersen/Getty Images There were stretches during their first three games when the Rams looked like one of the worst offenses in football. They managed just 259 yards and six points at home in an ugly loss to a Steelers team missing Ben Roethlisberger, and weren’t much better the week before at Washington. Even after acquiring Nick Foles, the Rams offense was geared toward the run game. Part of that involved collecting two starting offensive linemen in the first three rounds of this spring’s draft, but most of it had to do with Todd Gurley. After looking notably human for most of the first half against Arizona — four carries for 2 yards — Gurley became a force of nature in the second. What made him the 10th overall pick, despite a torn ACL suffered last fall, was a combination of speed and power that doesn’t come along often — an ability to run by defenders just as easily as he could run them over. That showed up throughout the third and fourth quarters, with the former Georgia back ripping off runs of 23, 12, 52, 20, and 30 yards. The new-look offensive line played its part in creating plenty of creases, but it was up to Gurley to find and take advantage of them. He made arm tackles disappear and turned any sliver of an opening into a backbreaking play for Arizona. We’ve seen glimpses from rookie running backs in the past that never turned into anything else, but it’s worth mentioning that Gurley had twice as many runs of 20 or more yards yesterday (four) as Trent Richardson had his entire rookie season, and he did it playing against a Cardinals defense that came into the game ranked seventh in run-defense DVOA. All Les Snead had to do yesterday was sit back, take in what he’d built, and smile. Finally. Coming into the year, St. Louis’s blueprint was easy to decipher. The Rams planned to field a terrorizing defense and an offense that lived on big plays through the air while churning out yards on the ground. That all came together against a team that had looked as dominant as any in the league, and it highlighted nearly every high-profile move Snead and his regime have made: two scores from Tavon Austin, including a beautiful throw by Foles on what would turn into the game winner; nine quarterback hits on Carson Palmer from that high-priced defensive line; and, finally, Gurley salting the game away and looking like a superstar in the making as he did it. Atlanta has yet to take apart a great defense, but dismantling a decent one shouldn’t be ignored. The Falcons started the day ranked seventh in offensive DVOA, and even if a fourth quarter of Terron Ward carries affected their per-play efficiency, Atlanta’s ability to score at will for most of the game should have it near the top of the league this week. Julio Jones has been playing every game like a superhero, but what should really scare defenses about the Falcons’ bludgeoning of the Texans is that they barely needed Jones to get out of the phone booth Sunday. Leonard Hankerson continued to enjoy life with Matt Ryan to the tune of 103 yards and a touchdown, and Devonta Freeman just picked up where he left off against Dallas a week ago. Ryan was excellent yesterday — 19-of-27 for 256 yards — but what stood out again for the Falcons was how Kyle Shanahan and the offensive staff are putting Atlanta in spots to thrive before the ball is even snapped. On both of Freeman’s longer touchdown runs, the space was created by getting linemen moving, and the left-sideline, 44-yard wheel route in the second quarter was one of the more beautifully designed plays you’ll see.  For years, Shanahan has shown an ability to instantly get an offense cranking — Robert Griffin’s rookie year in Washington, the first half of last season in Cleveland — and the same appears to be happening in Atlanta. This situation is Shanahan’s most promising and sustainable yet because, for the first time, he has elite talent in Ryan and Jones. With Luke Kuechly out, the Panthers have been forced to look elsewhere for their game-changing plays on defense, and Josh Norman has been providing them. Norman added two more picks yesterday, giving him a league-leading four on the year, as the Panthers moved to 4-0.  Norman walked the first interception in for a score and made the second look just as easy, feasting on an underthrown ball from Jameis Winston. He was far from perfect on the day — Vincent Jackson, his primary assignment, still managed 10 catches as he found a few holes in the Carolina defense — but Norman added another pass breakup on a deep throw up the left sideline to go along with his pair of picks. At some point, quarterbacks may learn that 34-year-old Charles Tillman is a better target.   The Giants defense gave Tyrod Taylor fits, and the previously explosive Karlos Williams managed just 40 yards on 18 carries. Kerry Wynn and Devon Kennard made plays that leaped off the screen. On an interception of a throw that Taylor tried fitting into a tight space for Charles Clay, Kennard went step-for-step with Clay up the sideline before snatching the ball away. And Wynn spent a good chunk of the day in the Buffalo backfield, as he somehow collected a team-leading eight tackles from his left defensive end spot. Tackle numbers can occasionally serve as a poor metric, but most of Wynn’s ended with the Bills’ running game going backward. He was a part of the action on run plays that went for no gain, minus-1, 1, minus-7, minus-3, and 1, and that doesn’t even include a pressure on Taylor that resulted in an incompletion. The Giants run defense has been the surprise of their season. Bottling up Matt Jones and the Washington running game last week put them sixth in run-defense DVOA, and that number should only be getting better after slowing down Williams. Players like Johnathan Hankins were already on their way toward being stars coming into the year, but Wynn — a 2014 undrafted free agent out of Richmond — has been an unlikely factor in the Giants’ stout run defense.",2015-10-05T14:43:05+00:00,NFL,Mays
125,From Marinovich to Russell to Carr: Have the Raiders Finally Found Their Quarterback?,"The Raiders are no strangers to offensive futility. Even before hitting the point-scoring wasteland of this past decade, much of Oakland’s recent history has been spent searching for a quarterback. The Rich Gannon era was like stumbling onto an oasis in the desert, more happenstance than a plan: Gannon was 33 when he arrived from Kansas City, where Elvis Grbac had edged him out for the starting job. In Oakland, he went to four straight Pro Bowls — the only four of his career — and miraculously won the MVP in 2002. Considering what had happened before and what’s happened since, Oakland deserved that bit of luck. Marc Wilson is the first name Oakland fans will roll their eyes at. The Raiders drafted him 15th overall in 1980 as the long-term replacement for Ken Stabler, but when stopgap quarterback Dan Pastorini broke his leg, the Raiders turned to 32-year-old Jim Plunkett instead of the rookie. A few months later, Plunkett helped Oakland win its third Super Bowl. Wilson was eventually handed the reins, but he never did much with them. He started 60 games and finished his career with 102 interceptions and just 86 touchdowns. In 1988, Oakland moved on from Wilson, first rolling with former Washington quarterback Jay Schroeder, and then drafting Todd Marinovich 24th overall in 1991. While the Marinovich project was famously short-lived, the miss that hurts the most is the most recent. In taking JaMarcus Russell first overall in 2007, the Raiders passed on Joe Thomas, Calvin Johnson, and Adrian Peterson, all for a quarterback who started 25 games in his career. There have been trades for Carson Palmer and dalliances with Terrelle Pryor since then, but really, the Russell catastrophe brings us up to date. Dredging up the list of failed Raiders quarterbacks shows just how deeply the Raiders had been stuck in the muck. But three games into this season, mentioning names like Russell, Marques Tuiasosopo, and Andrew Walter helps explain something else: the bliss that Raiders fans must be feeling as they watch Derek Carr and the rest of the Oakland offense. ??? Anyone who appreciated the ability to really sling a football — and I mean really sling it — couldn’t help falling for Carr when he was coming out of Fresno State. As a pure thrower, he had the most talent of any quarterback in last year’s draft. The problem is that NFL success is rarely tied to how good a player looks whipping it around the yard. It can elevate a quarterback with all the other requisite traits (see: Aaron Rodgers), but it’s hardly necessary (see: Peyton Manning). When Carr fell to the second round, it was reportedly because he had problems showing off that arm amid imperfect conditions. Carr struggled with defenders around his feet at Frenso State, and even when he did have ample protection, there were moments when he was content to lean back and rely too much on that rocket launcher attached to his shoulder. When you look at the Raiders’ game plan last year, the theory that pressure was Carr’s worst enemy seemed to hold. Oakland finished 23rd in air yards per throw last season and Carr finished with an abysmal 5.5 yards per attempt as a rookie. The Raiders were content to subsist on a diet of short throws, and with a receiving corps that left much to be desired, they probably weren’t leaving much on the table. Still, Carr’s struggles as a rookie had to do with more than just his receiving options. His arm flashed every so often, but he also sailed plenty of throws and failed to use the space provided by a pleasantly surprising Raiders offensive line. Not taking advantage of the pocket remains Carr’s worst habit, even as he’s topped 300 yards in both of the starts he finished this year.1 This isn’t an easy throw to Mychal Rivera, but by drifting to his right when he could easily step forward, he makes it impossible.  Yet calling Carr impatient would be wrong. On plays where his primary read isn’t there, he’s content to hold back and let it all develop. And in the rare case that the pocket does crumble around him, he has a knack for keeping his eyes downfield and improvising throws that a lot of other quarterbacks can’t. The problem, rather, is that when his primary throw is there, he gets too eager. You could see the frustration after he missed this easy throw to Michael Crabtree on Sunday. It was pitch-and-catch, and Carr made it harder than it needed to be.  It’s a notable play because of the throw but also because it’s a good example of how offensive coordinator Bill Musgrave is giving Carr room to work. Against the Browns, the Raiders created tons of space based solely on alignment and route combinations — all in an effort to simplify Carr’s life and allow his arm to take over. As his final line suggests — 314 passing yards, nearly 10 yards per attempt, two touchdowns, and no interceptions — it often worked. The following play might be my favorite — a slant to Amari Cooper from a drive in the first quarter. With three wide receivers already lined up to the left side, Cooper has plenty of room as the single receiver on the right. Still, Musgrave goes a step further and motions Latavius Murray out wide just before the snap. With the linebacker now removed from the middle of the field, it’s only a matter of Cooper winning to the inside and Carr putting the ball where it needs to be. In those conditions, more often than not, he’s going to.  For as dark as its quarterback days have been, Oakland’s recent history at wide receiver hasn’t been much better. Randy Moss was the Raiders’ last 1,000-yard receiver, and even that feels like an empty victory, considering what Moss did for New England just a few months after leaving. Upon drafting Cooper, the hope was that the former Alabama star, considered the most polished college wideout in years, might change all that. And even if it’s been only three games, he’s certainly on his way. After roasting Jimmy Smith for a touchdown on a beautiful post-corner in Week 2, Cooper had his way with Joe Haden more than once on Sunday.  While Carr and Cooper are two big-time talents, they’ve been aided by an underappreciated offensive line. Without much fanfare, the Raiders have assembled one of the league’s more effective groups, especially when it comes to pass protection. Left tackle Donald Penn, cut in March 2014 from a Tampa Bay team that experienced some of the worst tackle play in football last season, has found new life in Oakland. Last year’s third-round pick, Gabe Jackson, is blossoming into a stout left guard, and newly signed center Rodney Hudson has been a welcome addition. Through three games, no quarterback in football has been pressured less often than Carr (13 percent of his dropbacks). The importance of that has been twofold. First, it’s allowed the Raiders to avoid some of the issues Carr dealt with in college when faced with pressure. And second, it’s given Musgrave the chance to utilize plays that rely on slower-developing route combinations to create space.  This is a throw that’s eventually going to find Cooper, who’s not even in the frame yet, over the middle of the field. It’s a crossing route that started with tight end Lee Smith on the left side and Cooper lined up wide to the right. Carr waits until Smith has completely made his way across the field before unloading, and with the area vacated, it’s an easy toss to Cooper that goes for 40 yards. There’s nothing complicated about that play, but it’s possible only because halfway into it, Carr has a completely clean pocket with which to work. Protection, space creation, and the wonder of Cooper all have played a role in why Carr has looked this good through three games, but in the end, his appeal still lies in his ability to make throws that few others can. The touchdown to Seth Roberts on Sunday was a beautiful touch pass on a well-designed out-and-up near the goal line, but his best throw of the season may have been on a play that came up just a yard short against Baltimore last week.  Andre Holmes deserves credit for somehow holding onto this ball — a 25-yard strike through traffic. The most impressive part of it is that Carr actually bobbles the ball and still manages to stick it on Holmes a quarter of the way down the field. It’s the sort of throw that’s impossible to ignore — a combination of arm strength, release, and accuracy that doesn’t come along often. The faults that sent Carr into the second round a year ago haven’t disappeared, but they’re slowly giving way to the rare traits that set him apart. As a rookie, Carr always needed an offense that provided an ideal set of conditions to show off his talents. Right now in Oakland, he’s getting that in the form of abundant protection and a soon-to-be star at wide receiver. There’s a long way to go, but after years spent stuck in the mud, at least the Raiders are finally going somewhere.",2015-09-30T15:00:53+00:00,NFL,Mays
126,"Cardinal Rules: Look Out, the Offense in Arizona Is Suddenly Explosive","By telling his 2-0 Cardinals they “ain’t shit” earlier this week, Bruce Arians once again proved he’s the coolest coach in football. He also proved he’s capable of lying through his teeth. Through two games, Arizona has the best point differential in the NFL and leads the league in DVOA. A walkover victory in Chicago helps those numbers, but it’s still fair to say the Cardinals have looked better than any other team in the NFC. This isn’t new territory for Arians and his team — Arizona won its first two games last year en route to a 9-1 start — but this year, the formula for that success has been tweaked ever so slightly. Previously, it was the strength of Todd Bowles and the defense that dragged the Cardinals to double-digit wins. But so far this year, it’s the offense that teams should fear. Right now, only Ben Roethlisberger has a better QBR than Carson Palmer. And no team has thrown the ball more efficiently than Arizona. Two weeks is a minuscule sample size, but it’s enough to get a glimpse into the potential of the group Arians and general manager Steve Keim have assembled. It’s been a process — one that Palmer, Arians, and his staff will claim is still ongoing — but in Year 3 in Arians’s system, the Cardinals finally seem to be hitting their stride. ??? For most of his life, Larry Fitzgerald was a typical elite receiver. The Cardinals’ plan for much of his career was to split Fitzgerald out wide to the single-receiver side, creating as much space as they could for him to work against a single cornerback. “He’d been an outside receiver, an X to the single-receiver side not only in the NFL, but in college,” says Darryl Drake, Arizona’s wide receivers coach. “For 13, 14, 15 years, he’d played that one particular spot.” When Drake and Arians came to Arizona in 2013, they approached Fitzgerald with an idea. As Fitzgerald hit his 30th birthday, maybe the best fit for him in Arians’s vertical offense was in the slot. “As he was getting older, it gives him an opportunity to flourish inside,” Drake says. “He’s not getting beat up outside, and it gives him the ability to work off your nickelbacks and linebackers instead of going against a premier corner every play.” That may not seem like a significant change, but like Drake says, Fitzgerald had spent almost his entire career playing one specific position in the offense. From his rookie season in 2004 through the end of 2012, no NFL receiver ran more routes than Fitzgerald’s 3,708. Of that total, only 698 came in the slot, approximately 18.8 percent of his total routes. Through 34 games with Arians, that number has jumped to 53.8 percent.  Fitzgerald may no longer have the explosiveness that made him the star of the 2008 playoffs, but the twitch in those muscles is still plenty fast to evade Jared Allen and Lamarr Houston in the open field. The profile of slot receivers is slowly changing throughout the league, but for the most part, the slot is still reserved for smaller, quicker threats. With Fitzgerald, defenses have to deal with a master route runner who also happens to have a massive 6-foot-3 frame and some of the strongest hands in NFL history. “That’s the uniqueness of Larry,” Drake says. “That’s the gift that he has, the ability to make those kind of catches with guys all over him.” On the surface, a move to the slot explains Fitzgerald’s resurgence this year — 14 catches for 199 yards and three touchdowns in two games. But why did it require two seasons to take hold? “It’s a number of things,” Palmer said at his press conference yesterday. “Him being in a new position and both of us being in a new offense being asked to do a number of things we haven’t been asked to do. It’s a process. This is not a starter-kit offense when you can plug someone in and it’s easy. We started getting things going in Year 2, he and I, as far as our rhythm and comfort level with him knowing what he’s doing and me knowing what I’m doing.” Last season, Fitzgerald had nine catches for 112 yards in the game Palmer tore his ACL against the Rams. But with a combination of Drew Stanton and Ryan Lindley at quarterback, the rest of the year was a slog for Fitzgerald. He failed to top 35 yards in any of Arizona’s final five games. The downgrade in talent from Palmer to Stanton is one part of the falloff, but Fitzgerald’s decreased role also had to do with a change in sophistication between a seasoned starter and a backup thrust into action. Arizona’s offense relies on more deep shots than any other in football. At 9.77 yards, the Cardinals led the league in air yards per attempt during their first two seasons under Arians. And while no one would call Palmer and his 8.84-yard average from 2014 conservative, that’s nothing compared to Stanton’s league-leading 10.9 that season. With Stanton, when all else failed, Arizona was willing to let it fly, which left Fitzgerald with a lot less to do. For wideout John Brown, on the other hand, the vertical element of the Arians offense was an ideal fit — in his second year, he’s only become a more dangerous threat on the outside. “We’re always going to continue, no matter what the defense is doing, to push the ball down the field,” Cardinals quarterbacks coach Freddie Kitchens told me. “That’s the way they stay off you underneath. That’s a general principle that every offense should have. We always have a built-in shot on every play. If it’s there, we take it.”  Brown and his 4.34 40 speed are the target for most of those shots, and against the Bears, he was moving the Arizona offense down the field even without showing up in the box score. Brown gave the Cardinals 80 yards of offense with pass interference calls on Sunday, including a torching of Kyle Fuller down the right sideline. Speed, as Drake notes, has always been Brown’s best asset, but in Year 2, he’s making those wheels matter on the field. With a receiver as small as Brown, Drake says, bump-and-run coverage on the outside is going to come often. That’s when the game becomes more about the tiny battles at the line of scrimmage. Some outside receivers — Julio Jones, Calvin Johnson, Brandon Marshall — can win those battles with physicality alone. But at 180 pounds, Brown has to rely on a knack for creating space. “The first time we worked him out,” Drake says, “I felt like he had it.” That workout was in Miami, at a park near Brown’s childhood home. The grass field they found had no lines, so Drake offered to put down some cones to help Brown spot his marks. “He said, ‘No, I know where 10 is.’ And then every route we ran, he got the depth. He got where he was supposed to. That’s just an understanding and an ability guys need to have.” ??? Christian Petersen/Getty Images John Brown and Larry Fitzgerald. Typically, the play of a 35-year-old quarterback less than a year removed from his second ACL tear would be headed in only one direction, but to hear Kitchens tell it, that’s not the case with Palmer. Kitchens has been Palmer’s quarterbacks coach since the latter was traded to Arizona early in the 2013 season, and in his mind, age has done nothing to slow Palmer down. If anything, Kitchens says, he’s getting better. “Oh yeah, definitely,” Kitchens said about whether this is the best version of Palmer we’ve seen in Arizona. “And that’s mainly because he understands what’s going on around him, the people that he’s playing with, and the system that he’s in.” Familiarity is a key component of Arizona’s growth, but for Palmer, it starts with health. The knee is still a concern, but another is the elbow problem Palmer’s dealt with for the past few seasons. A major knee injury is never a good thing, but for Palmer, the rehab process actually provided some hidden benefits. Not having to endure the daily throwing grind for the final 10 weeks of the year, Palmer’s arm got some much-needed rest. “It probably had more to do with just time off as far as his arm was concerned,” Kitchens says. That wasn’t all. As Palmer told The MMQB’s Jenny Vrentas this summer, the time off gave him a chance to step back and correct some mechanical flaws that would sometimes creep up as he made his progressions. By consciously keeping his weight on his toes as he made his reads, Palmer said, it allowed him to more easily step up in the pocket and extend plays just a bit further. “It will help my completion percentage, it will help with my accuracy and it will also help us as a unit, because I won’t be making my left tackle’s job as difficult,” Palmer told Vrentas. “In turn, I’ll be able to step into more throws. As I’m getting to my second and third and fourth read, I’m holding onto the ball a little bit longer and that pocket is getting slowly smaller, so it will give me more room to work with inside the pocket because I will be more centrally located.” Of all the strides Palmer’s made since arriving in Arizona, that ability to take pressure off his line is the one Kitchens points to first. “I think he’s above and beyond where he was protection-wise,” Kitchens says. “He knows the adjustments. That’s probably the no. 1 thing.” Through his first two seasons, Palmer was pressured on 27.4 percent of his dropbacks, which put him in the bottom third of the league. Through two games this year, it’s 20.7 percent, near the middle of the pack. Part of that improvement is a product of moves the Cardinals have made along the offensive line. Signing Jared Veldheer last offseason has provided some long-awaited stability at left tackle, and this week, Palmer and the offense will finally unveil Mike Iupati, the other half of Arizona’s high-priced left side. Iupati’s strength has always been as a run-blocker, which is welcome news for a Cardinals team that finished 30th in rushing DVOA a season ago. With the way Palmer and his receivers are playing, if adding Iupati and mixing in a bit more of touchdown machine David Johnson can give this team a bit more pop in the running game, this has a chance to be one of the more dangerous offenses in the entire league. Just don’t tell that to Bruce Arians.",2015-09-24T13:01:12+00:00,NFL,Mays
127,"NFL Winners and Losers: The Steelers Light It Up, the Eagles Fall to Pieces","Pittsburgh might have had the misfortune of being Gronk food in its opener, but the Steelers did the chomping yesterday. Ben Roethlisberger feasted on the same Niners defense that had made Teddy Bridgewater miserable in Week 1, averaging 13.7 yards per attempt. There was the typical output from Antonio Brown — who might actually be unstoppable at this point. He had another nine catches for 195 yards, and was about a foot shy of finishing with two touchdowns. The way Pittsburgh deploys Brown is part of the problem for opposing defenses. He’s given four or five chances a game to take the ball near the line of scrimmage and go to work, but he’s also a potent deep threat, as evidenced by his 59-yard grab that involved him corkscrewing a 49er into the ground. Roethlisberger’s two most impressive throws actually went to his other receivers: a 41-yard missile to Darrius Heyward-Bey down the middle of the field for a touchdown and a 48-yarder to Markus Wheaton on the right sideline, a throw that Roethlisberger somehow launched without setting his feet as he hustled out of the pocket.  This team will be paced by its offense. Lines like Roethlisberger’s against the Niners — 21-of-27 for 369 yards and three touchdowns — have a chance to pop up often with Todd Haley dialing up plays for the weapons they have. It’s more frightening to imagine what they’ll be like when they get back the weapons they don’t have. They’re still without two of the most potent forces that anyone in the league can deploy. Le’Veon Bell is back this week, and Martavis Bryant joins him two weeks later. Yesterday won’t be the last time this team lights it up. Here’s what I could dredge up about Travis Benjamin: Through two games, Benjamin’s six catches have gone for an insane 204 yards. That’s 34 yards per reception, for anyone scoring at home. And that doesn’t include the 78-yard punt return he brought back yesterday.  Cleveland’s passing offense may never be a study in efficiency with Johnny Manziel at the helm, but in a way, Johnny Football fits Benjamin perfectly. He’s a quarterback with no conscience, who won’t think twice about uncorking it down the sideline a few times a game to see if Benjamin can track it down. It’s a match made in big-play heaven, and it’s turned Benjamin into the most exciting player in football through two weeks. The moment New England’s defensive plan came into focus this spring, the pressure started to build for Chandler Jones. Letting Darrelle Revis walk left the Patriots with Devin McCourty and a shaky group of corners on the back end. This shifted the burden for slowing down opposing passing games more on Jones and the pass rush than it had been in recent years. The thought was that with Jones, a healthy Dominique Easley, Malcom Brown, and Jamie Collins, the Patriots would be able to fluster opposing quarterbacks. They certainly didn’t have much trouble against Buffalo.1 Tyrod Taylor was dumped behind the line of scrimmage eight times. Left tackle Cordy Glenn has been the Bills’ best pass-blocking lineman for a couple of years, but he will be quietly muttering Jones’s name for a while after this one. Jones had three sacks of his own and another quarterback hit as the Pats D terrorized Taylor all day. New England’s pass rush wasn’t the same when Jones missed a chunk of last season, and he was blanked in the opener by underrated Steelers tackle Kelvin Beachum. But if Jones can roast Glenn like he did, the lesser tackles on New England’s schedule are in a lot of trouble.  It would have been tough — impossible, really — for Odell Beckham Jr. to be better this year than he was as a rookie, but the same can’t be said about his hair. The haircut has taken the leap. I don’t even know how to describe it. There’s a slight Mohawk situation going on back there, but that’s about all I’ve got. Whatever. Beckham is allowed to do what he wants at this point, especially after what he did to Robert Alford on Sunday. Football is just better when Geno Atkins is Geno Atkins. The Bengals defensive tackle was ready by Week 1 last year after tearing his ACL the previous November, but anyone familiar with his particular brand of pass-rushing destruction knew they weren’t looking at the same player.  Atkins finished the season with just three sacks after putting up 12.5 when healthy in 2012. He was among the most dominant interior linemen in the league then, right alongside Gerald McCoy and Ndamukong Suh. Without Atkins at full strength, the Cincinnati pass rush took a nosedive. The Bengals were last in sack percentage last season (3.1 percent of dropbacks) after finishing third the last time Atkins played a full season. Through two weeks, they’re back to ninth, and with two sacks already, Atkins is already close to his total from last year. But when Atkins is on, sack totals don’t fully explain the impact he makes. He picked up three quarterback hits while manhandling the San Diego guards all afternoon. Predicting what might happen in Week 2 is always a perilous task. Teams that looked great in Week 1 (the Titans) inevitably falter, and teams that looked hapless (the Raiders) may not be that bad after all. Four of the weekend’s five biggest underdogs (Jacksonville, Oakland, Tampa Bay, and Dallas) won outright yesterday, with the Bucs, Raiders, and Jags ruining survivor pools nationwide. Jacksonville’s passing game, replete with its crop of receivers from last year’s draft, looked as potent as it ever has since (Blake) Bortles service began, and the Bucs managed to show some life against Drew Brees in a place he’s historically torched inferior teams. The most impressive win of the weekend, though, goes to the Raiders. Derek Carr lit up a talented Ravens D; with ample press protection all day, he was free to show off his arm in a way he hasn’t been with Oakland’s typical dink-and-dunk approach.  The Bears were not embarrassing against Green Bay in Week 1. In fact, they almost looked respectable. When you’re a Bears fan, you take hope where you can find it. The Packers didn’t move the ball at will, and even though Aaron Rodgers still fired three touchdown passes and hung 31 points on the board, the Bears appeared, for the most part, to be an NFL team. It was a nice surprise, and one that lasted for all of one week. There’s no good place to start in describing how much of a mess Chicago was against the Cardinals. David Johnson brought back the opening kickoff for a touchdown. Jay Cutler got hurt — again — while futilely trying to prevent a pick-six. The Bears managed only 59 yards on Jimmy Clausen’s first eight drives. Larry Fitzgerald caught eight passes and three touchdowns. And to top it off, the Bears were penalized 14 times for a franchise-record-tying 170 yards. Losing Cutler was bad news, but even without their starting quarterback, this was the sort of debacle that was supposed to be a memory with John Fox in charge. Oh well, at least the Cubs are good. Please come back, Arian Foster. Only you can save us from this. Hell, even when Foster does return, the Texans will still have to choose between Ryan Mallett and Brian Hoyer at quarterback, and through two games, neither of them is all that appealing. After relieving Hoyer last week, Mallett had his own rough outing yesterday. His 244 yards came on 58 (!) passes, many of which were launched to no one in particular. That much throwing is a significant departure from Bill O’Brien’s 2014 offense, which ran the ball more often than any team in the league except Dallas. In O’Brien’s defense, it’s hard to keep running when your team is averaging 2.7 yards per carry. And even that number is inflated after a 6-yard run from Mallett. Foster’s absence is apparent, but injuries up front are also dooming Houston’s running game before it can even get started. Already without star left tackle Duane Brown and starting left guard Xavier Su’a-Filo, the Texans lost backup guard Jeff Adams midway through their Week 2 game against the Panthers. For the Houston offense to have any chance this season, without Foster and with either of these quarterbacks, it all needed to break right along the line, and so far, it’s gone about as badly as it could have. This Eagles season was always going to rest at Chip Kelly’s feet. When owner Jeffrey Lurie handed Kelly control of Philadelphia’s roster, he empowered a coach who firmly believes in his own vision of how a team should look. We know what happened next. Jeremy Maclin was allowed to walk, LeSean McCoy was traded to Buffalo, Nick Foles was swapped for Sam Bradford, and both starting guards were cut loose. Most of the major elements from an offense that finished 13th in DVOA last season were switched out in favor of pieces Kelly thought better suited his scheme. Kelly’s approach to his ground attack this offseason was simple. He’d make up for cutting his two starting guards and trading his star running back by bringing on a pair of backs that better fit his offense. The decision to run $22 million guaranteed of running backs behind $1.1 million of guards seems to be backfiring. Kelly hoped the decisiveness of Murray would be enough to close the gap between Evan Mathis and Allen Barbre. But so far, even Murray hasn’t had enough time to make decisions behind the Eagles’ line. Last season, the Eagles averaged 2.88 yards before contact per rush, the seventh-best rate in football. This year, that’s plummeted to 1.39. Only the Saints have been worse. Yesterday, the Eagles couldn’t even get their backs past the line of scrimmage before they were getting whacked. They managed minus-0.29 yards per carry before contact against a Cowboys run defense that finished 22nd in run defense DVOA last season. Having Sean Lee back helps, but Dallas isn’t exactly the steel curtain. Blaming the Eagles’ running woes on the losses of Mathis and Todd Herremans is perhaps too simple. Philadelphia dealt with a rash of offensive line injuries last year, and although the Eagles didn’t have the same dominant running game they did in Kelly’s first season, they still had more to offer on the ground than this. So what’s the problem? With Foles under center, the deep ball was a central part of the Eagles offense. They averaged 9.49 air yards per attempt in 2013, the most in football, and even with Foles missing a chunk of last season, the Eagles still finished eighth. This year, they’ve fallen to 29th, averaging just 5.35 air yards per throw. If teams don’t fear Bradford’s ability to push the ball downfield, they’re able to commit more resources to slowing down the running game. If the running game can’t get going, the play-action throws that define Kelly’s scheme aren’t as effective. A destructive cycle emerges. There’s also the possibility that teams have started to catch on to how Kelly naturally creates running lanes within his offense. The Dolphins have run into similar trouble on the ground. After finishing last year with the second-best per-carry average in the league, Miami is 26th through two games, averaging just 3.41 yards per carry. That’s still better than the 32nd-ranked Eagles and their 2.12 average, but it’s a drastic drop-off from where Miami was a season ago. The connection? Former Eagles assistant Bill Lazor runs the Dolphins offense, and the Dolphins offense most resembles Philadelphia’s. Two weeks isn’t enough to close the book on any unit (last year’s Packers, anyone?), but so far, the returns on Kelly’s experiment haven’t been promising. We’re months away from being able to label the plan a failure, but if we get there, there aren’t many ways to place the blame.",2015-09-21T12:34:25+00:00,NFL,Mays
128,Run the Jewels: Could This Be the Best Rookie Running Back Class in Years?,"Last season belonged to the rookie wide receiver. The 2013 class had some early success — DeAndre Hopkins and Keenan Allen still look like its best products. But the pass-catchers who emerged in 2014 were the best in history. Of the 20 highest receiving yardage totals by a rookie since the merger, four of them came last year. Only Randy Moss and John Jefferson had more receiving touchdowns as rookies than Odell Beckham Jr. and Mike Evans. And while the Dolphins’ Jarvis Landry wasn’t piling up the yards, he had the fifth-highest reception total among rookie receivers since 1970. When an anomaly like that occurs, it’s going to cause a stir. Many wondered how, in the age of the spread offense, college receivers could acclimate more quickly to the pro game than ever. Some attributed the phenomenon to the growth of 7-on-7, some to an uptick in pass attempts, and others to a concentration of talent that had more to do with randomness than a developing trend. When surveying this year’s class — from draft day through Week 1 — the wave-of-talent argument gains steam. Bears rookie Kevin White missing at least the first six games hurts this class’s ability to make an early impact. But one game into the season, there’s a new class of skill position standouts: 2015 could be the year of the rookie running back. ??? Norm Hall/Getty Images David Johnson Any argument in favor of this becoming a memorable running back class starts with draft position. Two drafts had come and gone without a back going in the first round. The last one had been Trent Richardson in 2012, whose subsequent face-plant in Cleveland and Indianapolis may actually have spooked teams out of taking a running back in the first round. That streak ended this year, when the Rams surprised just about everyone by taking Todd Gurley with the 10th overall pick. Melvin Gordon wasn’t far behind — he was snatched up by the Chargers, who sent a 2015 fourth-round pick and 2016 fifth-round pick to San Francisco to jump up two spots to grab Gordon at no. 15. The days of Jonathan Stewart being taken in the first round only to take a backseat to DeAngelo Williams are over. A running back chosen in the first half of the first round will get his touches early and often — and with Gordon that appears to be true. He got 14 carries in Week 1, and although he managed only 51 yards, the former Badger looked more decisive than he had at any point in the preseason. And even though DeAndre Levy was on the shelf (and Ndamukong Suh is in Miami), Detroit still had a historically dominant run defense a year ago. A first-round talent like Gordon is sure to see the bulk of the carries in San Diego — but what makes this class intriguing is the players further down the draft chart who are getting a crack at the lead role in their backfield. Tevin Coleman toted the ball 20 times for the Falcons on Monday night, and against a defense that finished seventh in run-defense DVOA a year ago, he looked damn good doing it. T.J. Yeldon carried the ball 12 times for a Jaguars’ team that spent much of the afternoon behind — he seems to be the undisputed no. 1 option in Jacksonville. With Coleman, Yeldon, and Gordon, it looks like this class has three backs who — by design — are carrying the load immediately. But in recent years, that’s been increasingly less common. Since 2005, only three rookie classes have had three backs with at least 200 carries on the season; with even a slight increase in their use, Coleman, Yeldon, and Gordon would all figure to hit that mark.1 Gurley might be added to that mix sooner rather than later, too, as he is eased in after ACL surgery last November; Jeff Fisher declined to rule Gurley out for Week 2. Even if the Rams spend a couple of weeks easing him in, it’s likely that by season’s end, the no. 10 overall pick will be getting a majority of the work in St. Louis. If Gurley does take the reins upon his return, that’ll mean four rookie backs getting the nod at the start of their respective careers. It’s been seven years since that many rookies got the no. 1 job.2 Kevin Smith, Chris Johnson, Matt Forte, and Steve Slaton all handled the majority of their team’s carries in 2008 — but even then, it took Ahman Green tweaking his ankle in Week 1 for Houston to turn the ball over to Slaton. When Green returned to full strength, Slaton already had a stranglehold on the job. He finished with 4.78 yards per carry and 1,282 yards, the most of any first-year runner that season. Then–Texans head coach Gary Kubiak’s willingness to cede the job to Slaton that quickly was likely the product of seeing what his offense looked like with a 31-year-old Green as his no. 1 back in the preseason. For some reason — whether pass-protection, ball security, or some other malady — coaches typically seem hesitant to hand their running game to a more youthful option, even if it gives them some extra pop.3 Jamaal Charles remains one of the most maddening examples from recent years. Even as Charles was ripping off 6.4 yards per rush in 2010, the Chiefs were still willing to hand the ball to Thomas Jones — he of the 3.7 YPC at age 32 — 15 more times than Charles over the course of the season. That was actually Charles’s third year in the league, but the point stands. There are plenty of instances when coaches, making what they feel are the best (read: safest) choices, hang on to a plodding back for a few games too long. Typically, it takes a chunk of the season for these discrepancies to become obvious. But on Sunday, this year’s rookies were already clamoring for a larger role. Stephen Dunn/Getty Images Ameer Abdullah No one thinks LeSean McCoy is Thomas Jones circa 2010, but Karlos Williams exploding 26 yards for a touchdown on his first NFL carry was enough to make anyone stop and take notice. David Johnson was similarly impatient. On his first NFL touch, Johnson took a swing pass from Carson Palmer and scorched 55 yards down the sideline to put the game away for the Cardinals. When it comes to a younger, more dynamic back showing his time has come, Johnson’s situation in Arizona is ironic. It was only two years ago that Andre Ellington was playing that role in Arizona, tearing off 5.5 yards a carry as Rashard Mendenhall plodded through the line 217 times that season. Ellington looked good before getting hurt Sunday, and there’s reason to think if he can remain moderately healthy — and if Arizona can get guard Mike Iupati back reasonably soon — he can be effective in this offense. The frustrating part is that in his absence, Bruce Arians appears content to go with Chris Johnson as the lead man in the Arizona backfield while David Johnson and his 55 yards per touch are relegated to a situational role. It’s hard to argue with many of Arians’s choices in Arizona so far, but the first game Chris Johnson runs into the line and falls down 15 consecutive times, it will be easy to see why Cardinals fans might be screaming at the TV. The same will be true for Lions fans any day now if Ameer Abdullah doesn’t start getting more work for Detroit. Abdullah got one more carry than Joique Bell for the Lions on Sunday, but as Abdullah keeps tearing off 24-yard touchdowns, it wouldn’t be surprising to see the gap between them start to grow. Abdullah’s preseason made this predictable — it was obvious he’d leapfrog Bell before long. But what has a chance to put this 2015 class over the top is that even in cases that aren’t as clear, it’s not impossible to imagine a rookie winning out by season’s end. Buck Allen wasn’t spectacular in his nine carries against the Broncos — no one on the Ravens was — but he looked better than Justin Forsett. The same goes for Duke Johnson besting Isaiah Crowell in Cleveland. Both Allen and Johnson are in similar wait-and-see positions. It may not have looked this way last week, against two of the better run defenses in football, but both the Browns and Ravens have the personnel up front to be strong running teams in 2015. And in both cases, their lead running backs are players who didn’t have much pedigree coming out of college. Forsett was a seventh-round pick on his fifth team before breaking out with the Ravens; despite being a highly touted high school player, Crowell went undrafted last year. With the production the Browns and Ravens (understandably) want from their running games, both Allen and Johnson may not have to wait long for their chances. That’s the final piece of what could make this running back class one of the more important in recent memory. Last year, 14 rookie backs had at least 50 carries. That’s the most of any class since 2005, but it required a number of factors that no one could have predicted. Adrian Peterson spent 15 games away from the Vikings, Ryan Mathews went down in San Diego, Rashad Jennings got hurt after signing with the Giants, and Arian Foster missed his requisite three games in Houston. In only a couple of cases — Tre Mason in St. Louis and Jeremy Hill with the Bengals — did the takeover happen organically. This year, it’s reasonable to think that 14 figure is in reach. There were 10 rookies who had at least four carries in Week 1, and that’s without Gurley or any major injuries to entrenched starters. By the end of the year, it’s not crazy to imagine that five or six rookies could have the lead spots in their respective backfields. After a deluge of receiving wunderkinds, the young runners may finally be grabbing the ball back.",2015-09-17T10:09:10+00:00,NFL,Mays
129,"Still Hated, Still Better: The Patriots Remind the Steelers That Not Much Has Changed","As the rain eased up in the moments before last night’s kickoff, an orchestra began to play. One by one, Robert Kraft and some former Patriots players paraded their four Lombardi trophies to a podium near the 50-yard line, but the first few notes of music they walked out to were so on the nose that it took a few seconds to believe what we were hearing. It was the start of “O Fortuna,” the final movement from Carl Orff’s Carmina Burana — which doubles as the sample in Nas’s “Hate Me Now.” After what happened last night against the Steelers, the rest of the league is sure to oblige. At some point during the first half of New England’s 28-21 win, the NBC broadcast noted that the Steelers coaching staff was unable to communicate because they were hearing the Patriots’ radio coverage through their headsets. Mike Tomlin confirmed as much in his postgame interview. Issues in New England? “That’s always the case,” Tomlin told reporters. Of course, the timing isn’t ideal, just two days removed from an Outside the Lines report detailing nefarious past behavior from Bill Belichick and the Patriots that seemed to have no limit. For his part, Belichick pleaded ignorance after the game. “We never get that answer,” Belichick said of the communication issues. “They just try to fix it, and they tell you it’s up or down or whatever. I don’t know. That’s not really a very strong area for me, is technology.” The NFL, and not the home team, is responsible for the headsets used during a game, but that will do little to curb speculation. One week into the season, the Patriots are already at the center of another controversy, real or imagined. The only part of last night that was more classically New England? How thoroughly the Patriots dispatched a familiar rival. ??? Jim Rogash/Getty Images Yes, he was facing a Pittsburgh defense that looks like it will be hapless for the second year running, but Brady was masterful. At one point, he completed a franchise-record 19 straight passes. That streak eventually ended, but on the night, Brady completed 25 of 32 passes for 288 yards and four scores. More than once, the Gillette crowd broke into chants of the quarterback’s name. And Brady called it “a pretty special night” … before following that thought with five or six banalities. It was special, but so is every night. In a way, yesterday’s win was an exercise in the same sort of methodical, system-first efficiency that’s defined New England during the Brady and Belichick era. The Patriots’ starting running back was a 5-foot-8 former fifth-round pick who didn’t carry the ball once over the past two seasons. And yet, Dion Lewis finished with 120 total yards, including 69 on 15 carries. Two rookies — undrafted free-agent center David Andrews and fourth-round pick Tre’ Jackson — started on the interior of the offensive line, but it was veteran Nate Solder who struggled and was eventually sent to the bench in favor of Marcus Cannon. As always, Julian Edelman hauled in Julian Edelman–like receptions. However, every good Patriots team also has at least one of those game-breaking elements you’d never call “methodical.” With this group, it’s the spiky-haired giant who plays tight end. Earlier this week, the Steelers laid out a plan for slowing down Rob Gronkowski. “You just have to jam him up a little bit, mess with his timing,” Steelers linebacker Ryan Shazier told ESPN.com’s Jeremy Fowler. “If you mess up their timing, they are really time-oriented. You have to mess up their timing and get in his face with pressure, then I feel we can slow him down a little bit.” That plan worked … for little more than a quarter. Early in the second, Brady followed a completion to Gronkowski down the seam with a quick toss to him on the outside. The Steelers failed to cover the world’s best tight end out wide, and after shrugging off a tackler, Gronkowski barreled into the end zone for the first of his three scores. Gronkowski claims he was still “a bit rusty” after not playing during the preseason, and that should be a horrifying notion for the rest of the league. The Steelers defense was a mess last night, but even when they remembered to cover him, there was little they could do to slow him down. At this point, even when teams know the Patriots are going to force-feed their touchdown monster near the goal line, the anticipation doesn’t help. The second score was a simple pop pass off play-action that saw Gronkowski just reach over a linebacker and snatch the ball away in the back of the end zone. His third was a fade into the left corner against poor, overmatched linebacker Terence Garvin. There’s simply no answer for Gronkowski down there, and New England knows it. The inevitability of what happens when the ball floats to Gronkowski in the end zone does nothing to take away from how remarkable it is to see. His size and physicality make it easy to overlook the hulking grace he displays in that area of the field. The exactness of movement and footwork required to precisely operate in such a small space is normally reserved for players 50 pounds lighter. Gronkowski’s among the most unusual offensive weapons the league has ever seen. “Our red area offense was … good,” Belichick said after the game, making four touchdowns in four trips sound routine in the way only he can. Among the standard compendium of platitudes he issued last night, Belichick talked about the need to improve. And there’s certainly room for it. Solder’s play was worrisome, and against a team with some semblance of a pass rush, the Patriots offensive line might have been more exposed than it was last night. On the other side of the ball, New England’s pass rush was nowhere to be found, and 2014 first-round pick Dominique Easley, who missed most of his rookie year recovering from a torn ACL suffered in college, left the game early with a hip injury. Without Vince Wilfork on the inside, the questions about who holds down the middle of New England’s defense remain warranted, thanks to DeAngelo Williams’s 127 yards on the ground last night. In comparison to what the defending champions displayed as a whole, though, those are all small problems. No one expected anything less than excellence from Brady in the wake of this offseason, and unsurprisingly, he and Gronkowski and Edelman delivered in the relentless way they so often do. The chatter about footballs and low-level subterfuge isn’t likely to settle after what took place last night, but if Kraft can keep unfurling banners while dancing to T-Pain and holding a silver trophy in his right hand, the Patriots likely won’t care. Plenty of fans, opposing coaches, and opposing players will take up the orchestra’s offer: They’ll keep hating New England, because the Patriots won’t be changing any time soon.",2015-09-11T10:53:33+00:00,NFL,Mays
130,"NFL Week 7 Winners and Losers: Panthers and Vikings Are Turning Up the Heat, But Texans Get Barbecued","Matthew Stafford is going to start calling in sick when Minnesota is on the schedule. In two starts against the Vikings this season, Stafford has been hit 21 times, including the 13-hit pummeling he received yesterday. It’s hard to imagine a more thorough beatdown than the one Minnesota’s defense doled out. At a certain point, it just seemed cruel. The pressure came from everywhere: Everson Griffen had 1.5 sacks, the underrated Tom Johnson added another, and Anthony Barr met Griffen at the quarterback once. Harrison Smith and Chad Greenway each dragged Stafford down once, and even Eric Kendricks added two sacks. Mike Zimmer’s defense blitzed on 41.2 percent of Detroit’s dropbacks, and six of the Vikings’ seven sacks came when bringing extra pressure.  By the end of the game, Stafford was just curling up in the fetal position, and it’s hard to blame him. Minnesota moved to 4-2 and would sneak in as the NFC’s second wild card if the playoffs started today, but this is still a team with plenty of flaws. The Vikings came into yesterday’s game ranked 30th in passing DVOA, and Teddy Bridgewater has generally been disappointing in his second year. Right now, the offensive line is bad enough that the running game is almost entirely dependent on Adrian Peterson ripping off one absurd run after he finishes throwing a defender off himself in the backfield. There’s a lot of young talent here, though, and that’s before even mentioning the emergence of fifth-round pick Stefon Diggs, who made an incredible catch on a ball he had no business tracking down in the end zone. Even if Minnesota doesn’t steal a playoff spot this year, there’s plenty to be excited about. Before the season, Martin wouldn’t have been on anyone’s list of players who might rebound in 2015. After his promising rookie year in 2012 (1,454 yards and 11 scores), Martin failed to hit 4 yards per carry in either of the past two years. Combine that with the Bucs bringing in two new starters on the offensive line and Tampa Bay’s running game looked like it would be DOA. Martin has had a few underwhelming outings this year — 21 carries for 78 yards against New Orleans, 14 carries for 46 yards against Houston — but the past three games have been the best stretch of his career. This is the first time Martin has had three straight games in which he’s averaged more than 5 yards per carry, and he’s done it with a sizable workload. He’s had at least 19 carries and hit the century mark each week. In Week 1 against the Titans, it looked like Martin had a little more pop than in past years, but because that was against defense that often struggles against the run, it was tough to tell where to place the credit. Now it looks like we have our answer. Through six weeks, he has the second-highest rushing total in the league, and he’s doing it behind an offensive line that features two rookies and two players (Joe Hawley and Gosder Cherilus) cut by other teams just before the season started. It’s an impressive body of work for an offense that needs some answers. Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images At first glance, Ryan Tannehill’s 18-of-19, 282-yard, four-touchdown day looks like a monster performance, but dig a little bit and that changes quickly. The Dolphins threw for 296 yards (including a 14-yarder from Matt Moore) on 20 attempts for a gaudy 14.8 yards per throw, but 248 of those yards came after the catch. Miami averaged just 2.85 air yards per attempt, the smallest Week 7 figure in the league by nearly a yard and a half. The Miami game plan consisted of getting the ball into the hands of its playmakers and letting them go to work. That isn’t a bad idea when those guys are Lamar Miller and Jarvis Landry. Miller showed off that terrifying gear we all knew was lurking, but the highlight of the day belonged to Landry.  Watch Andre Hal fly out of bounds as Landry throttles down along the sideline. No player on earth stops and starts the way Landry can. On seemingly every catch, at least one defender goes sailing past him. Landry doesn’t break that many tackles, but it’s only because so few players even get close enough to touch him. Through his first 22 games, Landry has proved to be among the more intriguing players in the league. He’s 5-foot-11 and ran a 4.77 in the 40-yard dash at the combine. A player with that sort of physical profile shouldn’t be a constantly dangerous weapon, but Landry’s body control, vision, and open-field talent make him one. This is real, people. The Panthers are here to stay. Carolina beat up Sam Bradford and the Eagles offense yesterday, and it meant a decisive win even without Cam Newton playing his best. It’s worth talking about just how impressive Ron Rivera’s run in Carolina has been lately. How Rivera and Sean McDermott manage to piece together a top-flight defense every year with Popsicle sticks and duct tape is beyond me. The Panthers have played half of their games without Luke Kuechly, are starting Charles Tillman and Roman Harper — combined age, 66 — in the secondary, and were so desperate for edge-rushing help with Charles Johnson out that they sent a pick to Chicago for Jared Allen. Oh, and they came into the week ranked fifth in defensive DVOA. It’s kind of amazing. But there’s talent on that side of the ball outside of Kuechly. Thomas Davis is about as steady as it gets now that the football gods have decided to spare him, Kawann Short has turned into a problem (for offenses) as an interior pass-rusher, and Josh Norman is now a black hole for receivers. Their presence explains how the Panthers can remain great on defense even with the aforementioned injuries. How they’ve managed to put together the 11th-most efficient offense in the league with Ted Ginn and Corey Brown is an entirely different story. It starts with the running game. Carolina was fourth in rushing DVOA before Jonathan Stewart ran all over the Eagles, who had one of the best run defenses in football. Stewart is hitting his stride after a slow start, and part of that is this offensive line playing better than most would have expected. Trai Turner, who Carolina took in the third round a year ago, is turning into a star, and Ryan Kalil is healthy and playing as well as any center in football. The Panthers averaged 4.03 yards before contact per rush yesterday, comfortably their best mark of the season and more than enough for a guy with Stewart’s talent. Carolina’s formula is simple: It’s going to play great defense, run the ball well, and let its quarterback make the occasional spectacular throw to put it over the top. Through seven weeks, it’s worked like a charm. You have to feel for Josh McCown. He is on the road against maybe the best pass rush in the NFL, which is enough to worry about on its own. And now he has to deal with slippery floors and brick walls, too.  McCown took eight hits on the day — seven from the Rams and one from the wall — but actually played fine, all things considered. He threw for 270 yards on 32 attempts. Cleveland’s problem is that it just couldn’t hold on to the ball. The Browns lost four fumbles, including two strip-sacks by William Hayes. It was that kind of Really? day for the Browns. Even when McCown was avoiding Rams, he was getting hit by walls, and even as Joe Thomas was keeping Robert Quinn relatively in check, Hayes was doing damage on the other side. All of that and Todd Gurley being absolutely ridiculous was more than enough for St. Louis. Oh, and until further notice, I’ll be including the most insane thing Gurley does every week. In this case, there are two, because I honestly couldn’t pick:   Just like everyone predicted two years ago, the Eagles offense is the unit holding them back. Philadelphia picked off Newton three times last night, but it still wasn’t enough. It’s undoubtedly been a frustrating year for the players on the Eagles defense. Stewart had a big day on the ground, but the Eagles were third in defensive DVOA coming into yesterday, and overall, it’s an interesting, entertaining, and — at times — dominant collection of talent. Philly’s front might be the league’s most intriguing group of players at those positions. Connor Barwin does just about everything. Fletcher Cox is just 24 years old, already a star, and about to get paid. And that’s before even getting to the complementary pieces. You couldn’t give me enough money to block Bennie Logan for three hours. I’m convinced he’s part bear and no one is going to tell me otherwise. Look at this quote from Logan, via Ed Barkowitz of the Philadelphia Daily News, about sacking Drew Brees two weeks ago: “I like the more physical play,” Logan said. “A quarterback is just going to sit there and go down. He’s not going to do anything. I like someone who’s going to give me a challenge, who’s going to hit me, too.” Again, no amount of money. As Philly’s nose tackle, Logan is literally and figuratively at the center of that stingy run defense, and the way he sucks up blocks creates opportunities for players like Cox and Cedric Thornton. There’s plenty happening behind that front too. Mychal Kendricks can flat-out play and Malcolm Jenkins’s second act in Philadelphia has been a pleasant surprise. Overall, Bill Davis’s group brings a ton to the table, and they deserve better than what they got from Chip Kelly’s offense last night — and most of this season. Tim Ireland/AP The chirping in the Buffalo locker room about frustrations with Rex Ryan’s defense won’t be quieting down after this week. Even as the Bills bothered Blake Bortles for most of the day, T.J. Yeldon enjoyed the best game of his career. Buffalo was 25th in run-defense DVOA before yesterday, and that’s likely to take a tumble after Yeldon and the Jaguars’ 27th-ranked running game put up 120 yards. EJ Manuel’s backbreaking giveaways — a fumble returned for a touchdown and a pick-six on consecutive Buffalo plays — aren’t a surprise to anyone, but for the second straight week, his play was enough to remind everyone just how much Buffalo is relying on Tyrod Taylor, a guy it picked up for nothing this offseason. Right now, the Bills are a team that isn’t doing much well, which is something I never expected to say. On paper, this group had its share of issues. Not having an identity wasn’t one of them. Even Buffalo’s strengths weren’t strengths yesterday. Thanks to Stephon Gilmore being superhuman, Buffalo came into the game with the best DVOA in the league against no. 1 receivers. Then Allen Robinson caught six of his nine targets for 98 yards and a score. With the Dolphins bouncing back and the Jets looking like they’ll be sticking around all year, the season might be slipping away for a 3-4 Bills team.  That yardage discrepancy above is pretty much all anyone needs to say about whatever you would call what took place in Miami yesterday. A 41-0 halftime deficit is indicative of more than quarterback issues or a bad day. For the second time this month, the Texans were embarrassed on the road, and along with the loss to Atlanta, this is the second time in four weeks they’ve been down at least four touchdowns at halftime. The disaster that took place on the field was compounded by issues off it. With Houston down 44-20 and less than five minutes to go, Arian Foster tore his Achilles. He’s done for the year, and at the start of next season, he’ll be a 30-year-old running back recovering from the most devastating lower-body injury an older player can have. Oh, and Ryan Mallett missed the team flight because he was reportedly stuck in traffic, according to Aaron Wilson of the Houston Chronicle.  Without Foster, and with the offensive line both banged up and struggling, Houston’s hopes on offense are almost nonexistent. That side of the ball was always going to be a question mark, with the path to success for O’Brien’s team relying more on stopping people than racking up points. But Romeo Crennel’s defense has been a no-show — 23rd in defensive DVOA before yesterday’s atrocity. The Texans are 2-4, and their wins have come against Tampa Bay (in a 19-9 rock fight) and Jacksonville (which required a Herculean effort from DeAndre Hopkins). This is turning into a lost season for Houston, and in the end, that’s going to be laid at O’Brien’s feet.",2015-10-26T16:48:15+00:00,NFL,Mays
131,"NFL Week 3 Winners and Losers: A.J. Green Goes Supernova, Philbin’s Phins Continue to Flounder","Cincinnati deserves plenty of credit for being 3-0, but the Bengals’ success has also come with some serious misfortune befalling the teams around them. Baltimore’s Terrell Suggs is already out for the year, and the same week Pittsburgh got back Le’Veon Bell, it lost Ben Roethlisberger to an MCL sprain. He may return for most of the second half of the season, but Pittsburgh is still looking at a month of Michael Vick. And if Roethlisberger hits the longer end of the four-to-six-week diagnosis, he’ll miss the Week 9 game against the Bengals. Still, credit where credit’s due: For the first time since all the pieces were acquired, the amount of talent on the Bengals offense has finally come into focus. With Tyler Eifert, Marvin Jones, and A.J. Green healthy, this is a truly dangerous stable of receivers. Aside from Giovani Bernard’s big day against the Chargers, the running game hasn’t been quite as dominant as expected, but there’s a chance that that will come along in time. And for the most part, the offensive line has been excellent. Through three weeks, the Bengals are seventh in average yards before contact, and only the Giants and Eagles are getting pressured at a lowered rate. Unlike most of the teams at the top, though, Cincy’s offense isn’t relying on a diet of short throws to keep Andy Dalton clean. The Bengals are the only team in the top five in pressure rate that averages more than seven air yards per attempt, and at 8.37 yards, it’s clearing that comfortably.  While Jones and Eifert are solid complementary pieces, for this offense to truly reach its peak, the Bengals need the version of Green they got yesterday. That doesn’t mean 227 yards a game, but it does mean the brand of dominant football he played during his first three seasons. Despite an injury-filled 2014, we still should’ve expected Green to return to that level. His all-time ranks for an NFL receiver’s first three years are as follows: eighth in touchdowns (29), second in yards (3,833; only Randy Moss had more), and first in receptions. This crew of talented, young receivers is deep, but before being banged up for almost all of last season, Green was the most productive of them all — by far. Congratulations, Raiders fans. You deserved this. For the past decade, the real black hole in Oakland has existed at wide receiver. The last 1,000-yard season for a Raiders wideout came a full decade ago, and considering that it was a pedestrian year in the otherwise unforgettable Randy Moss era, even that was depressing. Granted, a lot could go wrong for Amari Cooper before he manages another 710 yards, but so far, the fourth overall pick has looked even better than advertised. In helping the Raiders move to 2-1, Cooper chewed up Joe Haden for 134 yards on eight catches — the second of what I have to imagine is going to be a career filled with 100-yard games.  Cooper’s off-the-bat dominance would be the best news coming out of Oakland by far if it weren’t for Derek Carr. Yesterday, the second-year quarterback hit the 300-yard mark for the second straight week. He added two touchdowns, one of which was a beautiful touch throw to the back corner of the end zone — the exact sort of pass I’d claimed he had trouble with, even after a nice game against Baltimore last week. Carr still has plenty of work to do improving his ability to feel the pocket and step into some available throws, but the progress he’s made from Year 1 to Year 2 is still encouraging. Considering the work the 24-year-old Khalil Mack is doing on the other side of the ball — he had two impressive sacks yesterday — Oakland might, finally, be on a run of draft success. There’s really no need to talk about Julio Jones anymore. The only explanation is that he was designed by a scientist who wants to exact revenge on the world’s cornerbacks. Jones is on his way to a historic season, but the more encouraging sign for the Falcons is that, through three games, they’ve shown some signs of life on the ground. Atlanta finished 22nd in rushing DVOA a season ago, and after some pop from Tevin Coleman in Week 1, Devonta Freeman stomped through the Cowboys defense all afternoon. He finished with 141 yards on his 30 carries yesterday, and not a single one of those went for more than 17 yards. Freeman was ripping off seven and eight yards consistently against a Dallas defense that had been solid against the run over its first two games. Ultimately, Atlanta’s going nowhere without Jones, Matt Ryan, and that passing game, but if Kyle Shanahan’s offense can move the ball behind that questionable offensive line, this offense could really do some damage. When the Titans kicked a field goal to go up 13 points late in the third quarter, the Colts’ disaster season was about 18 minutes from becoming reality. The history for 0-3 teams and the playoffs is miserable. And although Indianapolis’s chances in the paper-thin AFC South are never that bad, had it fallen to Tennessee, the rumbling around the Colts might have been too much for Chuck Pagano to outlast. Andy Lyons/Getty Images After coming back to knock off the Titans, Pagano told his players, “That’s as big of a win that I’ve ever been a part of in my life. I’ll cherish that for the rest of my life.” Can you blame him? The issues for the Colts are no less real simply because the Titans didn’t hold on to their lead, but now the Colts get to face those issues at 1-2 instead of 0-3. Pagano hasn’t shied away from intensifying the pressure he’s facing as the coach of a team with Andrew Luck and Super Bowl aspirations, either. He turned down a one-year extension this offseason, and amid rumors of discord between the coaching staff and the front office, Pagano didn’t mind taking a few shots at the Colts’ roster construction after falling to the Jets last week. Those shots are probably warranted. Every move the Colts made in free agency — and in most of the other offseasons of the Luck era — has gone nowhere. That doesn’t lie at Pagano’s feet, but if his team had fallen yesterday, it would be him — and not general manager Ryan Grigson — facing reporters all week. It’s going to take more than last-second wins over teams in the AFC South for Pagano to stick around in Indianapolis, and although yesterday may not have been enough to save the Colts’ season, it may have been enough to save Pagano’s. It’s been only three weeks, but this year’s “Offseason Champions” banner is ready for the trash. The Dolphins made the biggest waves of the spring by handing Ndamukong Suh his $114 million franchise-altering deal, but that was hardly all the work they did in free agency. Miami dealt Dannell Ellerbe and a third-round pick to New Orleans for Kenny Stills, shipped Mike Wallace to Minnesota for a seventh-rounder, and gave buy-low candidate Jordan Cameron just $5 million guaranteed to replace Charles Clay. Although the Dolphins finished .500 last season, they clearly believed they had a talent base for something more, and with every notable move, the temperature under Joe Philbin’s seat cranked up just a bit higher. After what happened yesterday, he’s going to have a hard time even sitting down: Miami didn’t just lose to Buffalo, it was pummeled. And that beatdown comes just one week after giving the Jaguars their first non-Browns, out-of-division AFC win in four seasons. Rob Foldy/Getty Images The Dolphins are plagued with problems right now, but the most troubling part of these first three weeks is that they don’t do anything well. As soon as the Bills started handing the ball to a lithe Karlos Williams in favor of a banged-up LeSean McCoy, Buffalo had its way on the ground. And seven days after Allen Robinson’s career outing, Tyrod Taylor lit up Miami’s secondary for 277 yards and three scores. The Dolphins pass rush, a group that’s led by Suh and Cameron Wake and was supposed to define Miami’s defense, didn’t lay a hand on Taylor, who was sacked eight times against the Patriots last week. The offense wasn’t much better: Miami finally managed to surpass four yards per carry on the ground after looking awful for the first two games, but Ryan Tannehill spent most of the first half completing passes to Bills. Philbin’s current plight isn’t all that different from where he was at the same time last year. The Dolphins were also 1-2 heading into their pre-bye trip to London in 2014, but there are a few key differences between then and now. Instead of a hapless Raiders defense, it’ll be the Jets waiting for them at Wembley, and while last year’s first three games featured contests with the Patriots, Bills, and Chiefs, the Dolphins’ opening stretch of Washington, Jacksonville, and Buffalo at home is actually one of the more forgiving periods of their season. No unit on this team, on either side of the ball, has made significant strides from where it was at this point last year, and although injuries are partly to blame for exposing some of the Dolphins’ depth issues, they still aren’t enough to explain why certain aspects have actually gotten worse. The move for Suh was a clear sign — even if it does prove to be shortsighted — that Miami saw its chance to take the next step. So far, Philbin’s group has moved only in the opposite direction. Watching 11 early games at once makes for a dizzying experience. There’s so much going on that, occasionally, a barrage of outlier plays can disguise itself as a standard NFL Sunday. But sometimes, the anecdotal and the actual line up, and yesterday it happened with quarterbacks throwing the ball to players on the other team. If you felt like passes were getting picked and taken the other direction every 30 seconds, it’s probably because they were. Quarterbacks have thrown 32 interceptions so far in Week 3, equaling last season’s high, which came in Week 16. Some offenders — e.g., Colin Kaepernick — were worse than others, but in the ongoing case against the sorry state of quarterback play in the NFL, Sunday’s display should be Exhibit A. It didn’t seem like it could get any worse than San Diego having to use (approximately) 17 centers last year, but the Chargers O-line was essentially one four-quarter game of musical chairs yesterday. Exactly one lineman played every snap for the San Diego offense, which lost Orlando Franklin, King Dunlap, and Chris Watt for at least some portion of this game. The result was Philip Rivers getting so battered that we eventually needed a brief Kellen Clemens appearance with the game out of reach.  The Vikings notched only four sacks, but they hit Rivers eight more times. For the second week in a row, Minnesota did physical damage to the opposing quarterback, and although that’s never the goal, putting the heat on him is. Vikings general manager Rick Spielman has thrown more resources into his pass rush than anywhere else on the roster. It’s now a group that includes two first-round picks (Sharrif Floyd and Anthony Barr) and two notable signings (Linval Joseph and Everson Griffen).1 There was always a question of whether Griffen’s per-snap production would translate to a full-time role, but after piling up 12 sacks as a starter last year, he already has three in 2015. And five — yeah, five — of those hits yesterday were his handiwork. Meanwhile, Barr’s role in Mike Zimmer’s defense probably means his raw pass-rushing totals will never hit the heights they could in a scheme that asks him to repeatedly get after the passer, but he’s done more for Minnesota than you could ever ask from the no. 9 pick. Overall, it’s a young group — Griffen, the elder statesman, is just 27 — so there’s reason to believe this is just the start. Rivers will likely be just another name on a long list of Vikings-fearing quarterbacks come the end of the season. We see this with individual players a lot, but it can also happen with position groups and even entire sides of the ball: a reputation exists for so long and with such little questioning that it sticks around for a year or two more than is deserved. It’s been only three weeks, but we might already be there with the once-vaunted Ravens defense. Dealing with a Broncos offense desperately in search of its footing, Baltimore looked pretty formidable in Week 1, but since then it’s been sliced apart by … Derek Carr and Andy Dalton. The Ravens secondary was an injured mess by the end of last season, but with Jimmy Smith and Lardarius Webb back, the hope was that Baltimore’s defensive backs would be good enough to take advantage of a very good pass rush. Yet, with Terrell Suggs hurt and Pernell McPhee in Chicago, that pass rush has gone missing. The Ravens sacked Dalton twice, but the majority of Baltimore’s pressure was a product of sending extra bodies at the quarterback. That’s fine when it works — back-seven players Will Hill, C.J. Mosley, and Terrence Brooks all had hits yesterday — but if the pressure doesn’t break through, it allows A.J. Green to ruin your day. Smith, Baltimore’s first-round pick in 2011, was having the best season of his career before getting hurt last season, but in two consecutive weeks, he’s struggled with Green and Amari Cooper. For a team with the current (read: bad) version of Lardarius Webb on the other side, that just isn’t an option. There’s a chance that yesterday was the worst game Smith will play all season. The same goes for Hill, who labored when he wasn’t getting to Dalton. But we’re a few games away from this reduced version of the Baltimore pass defense being the new reality.",2015-09-28T14:21:55+00:00,NFL,Mays
132,NFL Week 1 Winners and Losers: Welcome to Marcus Mariota’s League,"Stuffed into a dark wool suit, Marcus Mariota daubed the sweat away from his forehead with the white towel in his right hand. It was a muggy afternoon in Tampa, which is another way of saying it’s September. After lowering the rag, Mariota paused, sighed, and confessed. “You know … I … yes,” he conceded when asked if the debut exceeded his expectations. Sunday was a meeting of franchises with renewed hope — the top two picks in the draft, both quarterbacks, were squaring off in Week 1. One game in, the hope in Tennessee looks more than warranted. Mariota was nearly flawless: 13 of 16 for 209 yards and four touchdowns. In jest, tackle Taylor Lewan chided his young quarterback after the game — “He missed three passes,” Lewan said. “That’s not perfect.” With Mariota’s 158.3 rating on the day, the architects of passer rating would certainly disagree. Tennessee’s fireworks started early. On the Titans’ fifth play, Mariota lingered on a play-action fake to Dexter McCluster, yanked the ball back, and flicked a dart to Kendall Wright tearing up the seam. Faced with a sea of green, Wright made a single cut and scampered another 40 yards for the score. “I don’t think the guys guarding me could guard me on that play, really,” Wright said afterward. “Not being arrogant … The defense that they ran, there were a lot of holes in the defense, and we worked on those plays all week for that Cover 2 defense.” Everything about the play was straight from an Oregon game in 2014. An extended mesh from the shotgun followed by a quick strike is second nature for Mariota, and all game, concepts from his Duck days were showing up. Late in the second quarter, with the Titans pushing deep into Tampa Bay territory, Mariota faked a handoff, sprinted left, and dumped the ball to Anthony Fasano near the left sideline. Fasano barreled 18 yards and nearly punched the ball into the end zone. “It was a concept we ran at the University of Oregon,” said Mariota, who might actually believe people don’t know where he went to school. “It was very comfortable for me to go out there and do that.” All game, Mariota looked as bored as someone carving up an NFL defense could, and that extended to his postgame presentation. Titans head coach Ken Whisenhunt tried to seem just as casual as his quarterback, but he admitted that there’s no feeling like a regular-season win. Plays like the touchdown to Wright and the throw to Fasano were absent from the Titans’ preseason, all part of an effort to show as little as possible in meaningless games. But Whisenhunt knew from the start that his offense would incorporate elements that made Mariota the force he was in college. He’d be foolish not to. “I was asked when we drafted Marcus if there would be some things that we did that he had done, and I said, ‘Yeah, we would incorporate some of those things.’” More than once, though, Whisenhunt cautioned against painting Mariota’s early success as a product of providing him with familiar choices. He singled out a third down on the Titans’ first drive, when Mariota stood in the pocket and delivered an on-target throw to Delanie Walker for a 22-yard gain that kept the drive moving. Tennessee got good news postgame when it learned that Walker’s hand wasn’t broken, as was originally feared after the tight end took a hard shot in the second half. Walker caught four passes for 43 yards and one of Mariota’s touchdowns. He represented just one of the overlooked Tennessee skill players who have a chance to truly emerge if this version of Mariota becomes the norm. Wright, who finished with four catches for 101 yards, is another. He flashed a knowing grin when told after the game that with Mariota, his time had finally arrived. But Wright mostly maintained the same tempered tone that most of the Titans, including their head coach, had after the game. Tennessee won its first game last year, too — a 26-10 victory over Kansas City — and it hasn’t forgotten the 14 losses that followed. “Just shut it down right now,” Lewan said. “Shut all that B.S. down. It’s one game. I think we played well. I think there are so many things we need to improve on. But if you guys say we’re back, I’m going to kick somebody in the knee.” Lewan can threaten all the bodily harm he wants; there’s no denying that yesterday was different. Mariota may not be a star yet. But he sure looks like one. The takeover has begun. Donald was unstoppable for stretches his rookie season, but even in the preseason, it was obvious this year might be something different. One game in, it sure looks that way.  After yesterday, Donald will be taking up permanent residence in J.R. Sweezy’s nightmares. Donald finished with nine tackles (three for loss), two sacks, and, just for kicks, another quarterback hit. But not even those numbers do justice to how dominant he was. He shot by, shoved back, and just generally terrorized anyone tasked with slowing him down. Robert Quinn added two sacks of his own, but it’s already clear that the best player on the St. Louis defense — a defense that gave up just 4.3 yards per play and looked every bit as good as advertised — is Aaron Donald. And when Seattle needed just a single yard to keep the game alive in overtime, there was never much doubt who would help seal it for St. Louis. Maybe all Andy Dalton ever needed was Tyler Eifert. The word on the 2013 first-round pick before last season was that he was set to be a significant piece of the Cincinnati offense, but before we got a chance to see it, a nasty elbow injury and eventual surgery sent Eifert to the shelf for the year. If his day against the Raiders was any indication, it’s easy to see what the Bengals were excited about. Eifert — and not A.J. Green — was the centerpiece of the Cincy passing game, corralling nine passes for 104 yards and two scores on his 12 targets. A serious problem for Oakland in the red zone, he was too fast up the seam for a linebacker to keep up on his first score, and poor D.J. Hayden could do nothing when Eifert and his 6-foot-5 frame simply reached over him for the second. Eifern having lost his entire sophomore campaign made it easy to forget about him heading into the season, but he’s still just two years removed from going 21st overall. Green is sure to have bigger days as the season goes on (dropping a pass in the end zone didn’t help), but this is still a passing game that has never found a true second option under Dalton. Eifert can carry that mantle. The setup is similar in Kansas City, where Jeremy Maclin got a dump truck full of cash to be the Chiefs’ top receiving option. Even so, Travis Kelce was the one responsible for lighting the Texans’ defense aflame yesterday, to the tune of six catches for 106 yards and two scores.  More importantly, though, he took back his rightful place on the touchdown-celebration throne. Kelce was a force after the catch last season (his 7.31 average yards after catch was third-best among non–running backs), and he kept that going in Week 1. The Houston linebackers didn’t have a prayer on Kelce’s second score, which saw him streak across the field and take a short Alex Smith throw 42 yards to the end zone. Like Eifert, Kelce will get his share of looks in Kansas City, and it looks like both know what to do with them. Rich Schultz /Getty Images An underrated aspect of watching multiple games at a bar is that without sound, there’s no context for some of the visuals that get thrown onscreen. Occasionally that’s a negative, but with moments like the random appearance of high school Todd Bowles, it makes them even better. Some cursory research reveals that Bowles is from Elizabeth, New Jersey, which means that taking the Jets job doubled as a homecoming. That homecoming got much sweeter yesterday. The final score — 31-10 — makes it look like the Jets trounced the Browns from the start, but Cleveland hung in for much of the first half. Cleveland actually moved the ball well on its opening drive but came away empty-handed after Josh McCown attempted the Josh McCown version of John Elway’s helicopter toward the goal line. This one ended with a fumble, a touchback, and Johnny Manziel taking over at quarterback. Manziel managed an early touchdown, but the Jets suffocated Cleveland’s offense for the entire second half. That was easy to see coming. A reasonable showing from the Jets offense wasn’t. Ryan Fitzpatrick was as advertised, and the Jets’ running game gashed Cleveland all afternoon, with Chris Ivory doing most of the heavy lifting. Brett Carlsen/Getty Images It was a convincing win for Bowles in his debut, but no one had a better Sunday than the man Bowles replaced in New York. Rex Ryan’s Bills didn’t just beat the Colts yesterday. They beat ’em up. A couple of late scores made the final a little less ugly, but for most of the day, the Colts had no answers when they had the ball. Buffalo’s front four were their typical, pocket-crumbling selves, bothering Andrew Luck even if they weren’t taking him to the ground. But the player who defined the Bills’ statement win was the one who seemed least likely. All week, there was talk of second-round pick Ronald Darby being thrust into action and not being ready for Luck and the Colts, but when the lights came on, Darby was everywhere. He was dropping receivers over the middle, planting ball carriers at the line of scrimmage, and picking off the MVP favorite. Darby’s afternoon is proof of what’s going to make Buffalo the league’s most frightening defense: Even their weak links look like they play for Rex Ryan. Plenty of wacky stuff happens every year in Week 1, but as of today, the Tennessee Titans are in sole possession of first place in the AFC South, and two of the consensus best teams in football are 0-1. The Colts and Seahawks are sure to have better days, but the imperfections of each were on full display yesterday. Indianapolis bottled up LeSean McCoy fairly well, but every time Karlos Williams got the ball, it looked like the rookie was being shot out of a cannon. And Tyrod Taylor going 14 for 19 while averaging more than 10 yards per attempt is a tough blow for a defense that has to lean on its ability to stop the pass. It’s hard to blame the Seahawks offensive line for the beating Russell Wilson took yesterday (six sacks, nine hits). St. Louis’s front four was sent here from a distant galaxy to destroy football and, if necessary, save Earth. But Seattle still had a hell of a time moving the ball, and even against less-talented groups, that offensive line may prove to be a problem. I feel bad including Tony Romo here, but that’s where we are with Romo: Even when he’s leading yet another comeback win, he still can’t have nice things.  As Romo delivered his postgame press conference in a shirt-tie combo that appeared to be selected by a person working in a pitch-black room, the news came down that Dez Bryant would miss the next four to six weeks with a broken foot. This means that for the next month we’re robbed of watching Bryant, and Romo is robbed of his top receiver and one of the most dangerous weapons in football. Someday, Tony, you’ll catch a break. During my time in the NFL, I played football and still hold two league records: most times suspended by the league, and the only guy to take off someone’s helmet and try to slam his head into it. How Pacman Jones didn’t get unceremoniously booted from the field after this is beyond me, but it would be shocking if he didn’t get at least a game off to go think about what he did. This was an all-time dirty play, and it’s the only reason Ndamukong Suh kicking off Alfred Morris’s helmet wasn’t talked about more yesterday. The other reason is Morris’s reaction, which is a perfect mix of anger and “Wait … seriously?” Rob Leiter/Getty Images Gary Kubiak had to enjoy his first win as Denver’s coach, but I’m guessing at least part of him was pained to see the efficient offense he’d built in Baltimore crumble before his eyes. It probably didn’t help that his new one didn’t fare much better. Yesterday’s game in Denver was difficult to watch — the Broncos and Ravens failed to manage even a single offensive touchdown. Both defenses are sure to be among the best in football (although losing Terrell Suggs for the season is a serious blow for Baltimore), but what we saw yesterday was more than just good defense. Peyton Manning could do next to nothing through the air, and C.J. Anderson’s 2.42 yards per carry probably isn’t what Kubiak envisioned when he got to town. Yet somehow, Joe Flacco and the Ravens were even worse. With left tackle Eugene Monroe out with a concussion, fill-in James Hurst was roasted all game by Von Miller. He and DeMarcus Ware accounted for nine hits on Flacco, who finished a Gabbert-esque 18-of-32 for 117 yards and two picks. “When you make some changes, everybody’s just kind of feeling their way out, it’s just going to be a work in progress,” Manning said postgame. “We’re going to try to get better throughout the season.’’ That’s true — because they couldn’t really have been worse. Ninety minutes. That’s all it took for the Buccaneers’ outlook to go from reasonably optimistic to flat-out disastrous. When Jameis Winston took the field to an array of pyrotechnics just before kickoff, Raymond James Stadium was nearly full, and his ovation dwarfed the introduction of any other Buc. By halftime, half the upper deck had bolted for the exits, and those who stayed were raining boos on Lovie Smith’s team. Winston’s debut, especially in the shadow of Mariota, was undeniably disheartening. His two interceptions, including the early pick that Coty Sensabaugh walked 26 yards into the end zone, were mind-boggling. Even his first few completions were rough. His longest of the first half was a ball that slid through a defensive back’s hands before it could reach Austin Seferian-Jenkins. But that’s to be expected from a rookie quarterback who wasn’t known for protecting the ball even when he was winning national championships. The Bucs weren’t supposed to be a mess on defense, where Smith was assuming play-calling duties for a team that finished middle of the pack in DVOA last season. Somehow, that side of the ball was more of a debacle yesterday. Mariota was a buzz saw, but that doesn’t explain the Bucs letting Bishop Sankey and Terrance West stampede them. Through the air, the same issues that allowed teams to carve up the Bucs pass defense last season had returned. Receivers ran open. Zones were easy to spot. It looked yet again like Tampa Bay was losing each play before the ball was snapped. Today, Smith is probably wishing he hadn’t let the world know he was taking ownership of this defense. Bucs fans were right to be excited about landing Winston, but there should have been just as much disappointment when Smith failed to lure Rod Marinelli from Dallas. Marinelli taking over as Smith’s defensive coordinator in 2012 helped to save a sliding unit in Chicago. In Tampa, Smith is on his own, and there may be no coming back.",2015-09-14T12:50:37+00:00,NFL,Mays
133,Power-Ranking the NFL’s Divisions,"This week, Bill Barnwell has been writing about all 32 NFL teams. So we decided to zoom out just a bit and take a look at the eight divisions across the league. Which four-team group is the strongest from top to bottom? Which one’s the most volatile? And which competition is a foregone conclusion? (Hint: the one with Andrew Luck.) From best to worst, here are our divisional power rankings.  Grant Halverson/Getty Images Potential Winners: (Maybe) Two
Overall Variance: Very high outside of New England The division that was home to the most high-profile moves this offseason also happens to be the one that made the most significant jump in quality. No team in the AFC East has an over/under win total of less than 7.5, and the Jets’ figure is that low only because recent memories of their offense are hard to shake. Even without Sheldon Richardson for four games, there’s a real chance the additions on defense take this from an average group to one of the league’s best. More 2015 NFL PreviewIt's almost here. For everything you need to know about the new season, follow all of Grantland's coverage.

Buffalo’s in a similar spot, but its situation is a bit more volatile with Tyrod Taylor at quarterback. The Bills defense is going to be devastating. We know that. But if Taylor can string together a few “holy shit” plays over the course of the year, it’s easy to imagine the Bills getting to double-digit wins. At the top, all the non-doomsday scenarios see New England winning 11 games and the division, but Miami may have a chance if the Patriots stumble. If the Dolphins offense takes another step and Ndamukong Suh helps mask some of their deficiencies on the other side, it’s possible they could give the Patriots a run. Of course, it feels like we say that every year. Potential Winners: Two
Overall Variance: Relatively low The over/under totals for the Cowboys and Eagles (9.5 for each) are more pessimistic than I am. If the Dallas offense can stay almost as healthy as it was a year ago, the Cowboys could easily put together 11 wins and take the division again. Meanwhile, Philadelphia’s strength is that outside the secondary, it’s better suited to deal with injuries than almost any team in the league. Chip Kelly showed what he could do last season with a combination of Mark Sanchez and Nick Foles and a piecemeal offensive line. There aren’t many outcomes in which the Eagles do worse than 9-7. However, Washington’s situation feels like the inverse of that. It should be better in the front seven, but outside of Ryan Kerrigan and maybe the run defense, there just isn’t much this team does well. It’s the likely last-place finisher. As for the Giants, it’s at least possible to envision a world in which Eli Manning plays slightly better than he did a year ago and the offense hums, but the defense is likely to be so paper-thin that it ultimately won’t matter all that much. Elaine Thompson/AP Potential Winners: One
Overall Variance: High San Francisco has a bleaker forecast than any team in this division. Just think about that for a second. It’s no longer the Rams or Cardinals holding back the NFC West from being the consensus best division in football; it’s the 49ers. With all the turnover on their offensive and defensive lines, it’s hard to pinpoint what this team is going to lean on. Maybe it’s the running game, but that’s not a guaranteed strength, and with defensive coordinator Vic Fangio and a couple of key secondary pieces gone, their pass defense is likely to take a tumble. St. Louis is the swing team here. Arizona’s defense, even without Todd Bowles, remains solid enough that the Cardinals should be able to stay afloat, but this feels like the year the Rams could move up into second. Their defense was frightening down the stretch last year, and that isn’t going away, especially if we factor in some expected improvement for the younger guys in the secondary. The Rams’ fortunes hinge on what the offense can do, though. They’ll hope that rookie Rob Havenstein, a second-round pick out of Wisconsin, can make enough of a difference at right tackle that they can lean on the running game when Todd Gurley eventually debuts. If Gurley can be a special back, one good enough to limit how much Foles has to do, St. Louis has a chance to make a run at the postseason. Still, that doesn’t mean the Seahawks will be sweating. It’s true that the financial reality we’ve been talking about for years — they can’t pay everyone — is finally starting to take hold: Kam Chancellor is still holding out, the centerpiece of the Seahawks’ offensive line is now gone, and it’s no guarantee they’ll have a reliable corner opposite Richard Sherman. But these are still the Seahawks, and they should be among the best teams in football. The front seven is scary, and Marshawn Lynch leads the best running game in the league. Even if this team isn’t the force of nature it’s been the past few years, most scenarios still involve the Seahawks winning at least 10 games. Even with the Rams ascending, they have a stranglehold on the top spot. Potential Winners: Three
Overall Variance: High, except for the bottom From afar, this division has looked the same for about a decade. Marvin Lewis has been in Cincinnati for 50 years, and the Bengals once again appear to be a team with a solid defense … and Andy Dalton. Pittsburgh is still a threat to win 10 games. Cleveland is an absurd mess on offense. And the Ravens are the class of this group. Some of that is still true, but many of the details have shifted. For starters, it’s no guarantee the Bengals defense will be as stingy as it’s been recently. With Vontaze Burfict on the PUP list, A.J. Hawk steps in at linebacker, and that didn’t exactly go well in Green Bay. Plus, the Bengals did nothing this offseason to improve a pass rush that finished 31st in adjusted sack rate last season. Geno Atkins returning to his 2013 form would go a long way in helping that take a jump, though. If he can be something close to what he was at his peak, and the Bengals can once again put together a top-10 defense, there’s a chance the offense is good enough that Cincinnati challenges for the division. A.J. Green is still A.J. Green, and it felt like the Bengals were starting to find their niche offensively late last season with Jeremy Hill and that offensive line. Pittsburgh is still a threat to win the division, but unlike in the Troy Polamalu and James Harrison days, it’s only because of the offense. The Steelers finished second in offensive DVOA last year, and at this point, the only piece from that group that will miss more than the first few games is Maurkice Pouncey, who broke his ankle in preseason and likely won’t be back until about Week 12. Pittsburgh probably won’t be as healthy on offense as it was a year ago, but with Ben Roethlisberger, Le’Veon Bell, and Antonio Brown, it still has one of the strongest cores in the league. The basement for this offense might be the highest in the league. Unlike their rivals, offense is where the Ravens have the most questions — who the hell is going to catch the ball, aside from 36-year-old Steve Smith? — but that O-line is still great and their defense is still nasty. Even after losing Pernell McPhee, Baltimore has one of the deepest, most talented defensive-line rotations in the league. It’s hard to imagine the bottom falling out here.1 Christian Petersen/Getty Images Potential Winners: Three
Overall Variance: Higher than you’d think This is no longer the Broncos’ division to lose. There are enough questions in Denver when it comes to Peyton Manning’s health, the look of their offense, and the offensive line (even with the addition of Evan Mathis), that it feels like both the Chiefs and Chargers may have a chance to steal the AFC West for the first time since 2010. I know my feelings for Philip Rivers have me more bullish on San Diego than most, but with the additions the Chargers made up front, this has a chance to be a high-scoring group. Still, it feels like Kansas City has the best chance to make a serious run at Manning & Co. Andy Reid is still one of the best offensive coaches in football, and Jeremy Maclin gives him another versatile piece to tinker with. That group could take a real step forward, and with their pass defense, that’s enough to make the Chiefs serious playoff contenders.2 Potential Winners: 1.5
Overall Variance: High, excluding the top spot The Jordy Nelson injury is a rough note on which to start a season, but the Packers are still the clear favorites. Even with their deficiencies on defense, a full season of Aaron Rodgers gives Green Bay the edge. Outside of Wisconsin, though, things start to get interesting. A few months ago, it felt like the Vikings had a real chance to surprise. The problem is that the season hasn’t even started, and the breaks already haven’t gone their way. Right tackle Phil Loadholt is out for the year, and now center John Sullivan is going to miss at least the first nine weeks after undergoing back surgery earlier this week. Those are the Vikings’ two best offensive linemen, and even if Adrian Peterson can mask those losses in the run game, it’s still a significant blow for an offense that a lot of people found intriguing. Minnesota still has a ton of young talent on defense, but those injuries probably give the Lions a leg up on what’s most likely a race for second place. Losing Suh has very real consequences, and there’s almost no way the Detroit defense will hit the heights it did a year ago. Still, there’s  a potential star in the front seven in Ziggy Ansah, a nice group of linebackers, and a solid secondary. Defensive coordinator Teryl Austin can still have this unit near the top 10, and if that happens, the Lions could make a big enough jump offensively to compete for a playoff spot. A healthier Calvin Johnson would go a long way, and if recent draft picks like Eric Ebron and Ameer Abdullah can add a new element to what Johnson and Golden Tate already bring, the Lions start getting dangerous. The Bears, well, they aren’t quite there. The mess that was last season has spilled over into this one: There’s a chance that Chicago’s receiving corps in Week 1 consists of Marquess Wilson and Eddie Royal; they recently moved their Pro Bowl guard, Kyle Long, to right tackle, weakening two positions in the process; and there’s a chance this defense will be a nightmare. For the first time in a while, Chicago is going into the season as definitively the weakest team in the division.  Potential Winners: Three
Overall Variance: Extremely high When someone figures out how the hell this division works, go ahead and let me know. The Saints still have Drew Brees and Sean Payton. That’s enough to put them in the mix. Carolina’s defense took a step back last year, and somehow it still won the division. For my money, though, Atlanta remains in the best spot to take home the NFC South. The Falcons still have plenty of offensive line questions, and it looks like we’ve seen the end of Roddy White being an effective option in the passing game. But both of those things were true last year, and Atlanta still managed to finish 10th in offensive DVOA. Matt Ryan and Julio Jones are a good start, and in Kyle Shanahan’s offense, there’s a chance both of those guys absolutely explode this year. Just how good the Falcons will be, though, comes down to their defense. With Dan Quinn in town and some new pieces to work with, they probably won’t finish last in DVOA again. If that group can go from awful to something resembling competency, the Falcons could easily push past 10 wins. Potential Winners: One
Overall Variance: Extremely low There just aren’t many outcomes at play here. Even if the Jaguars are a bit better and the Titans offense gets a jolt from Marcus Mariota, neither is going to push the Colts. Houston is the only team with the talent to challenge Andrew Luck & Co., but the Texans already have had things go against them. To give Indy a run, they needed an offense built around Arian Foster to pair with what’s likely to be a very solid defense. Except, Foster had groin surgery early last month and it’s unclear when he’ll return. That puts a bigger onus on Brian Hoyer, who, let’s be honest, just doesn’t inspire much excitement.",2015-09-10T15:09:58+00:00,2015 NFL Preview,Mays
134,"Watching Watt, the Inevitability of Dez, and Steve Smith’s Retirement Tour: Meet the 2015 NFL Triangle All-Stars","Two days. That’s all we have from right now until the NFL season begins. Yes, that’s hard to believe, but don’t worry, it’s true. Actual, real, live football is almost back, and to celebrate the return of the often horrible yet often great world of the NFL, we’re presenting you with the best the league has to offer. For some of these players, it’s all about football. For others, it’s all about peppermints. But the one thing that all of these guys have in common is that they each make Sunday the best day there is. Here are your 2015 NFL Triangle All-Stars. Quarterback: Philip Rivers, San Diego Chargers  We’ve reached a point where not a single thing that Rivers does should surprise anyone. That includes the occasional post-play or sideline tantrum, but it also involves what he can do with a football. Rivers is the only quarterback in the league to whom the laws of physics don’t seem to matter. Aaron Rodgers isn’t human, but he still makes all the ridiculous throws with his body. Rivers seems like he can actually bend the ball with his mind. He’s also among the most fearless quarterbacks we have. That tends to get him in trouble, but it also allows him to sneak throws — over shoulders and between defenders — that few others would even try. Thanks to San Diego’s decimated offensive line, Rivers was under siege late last season, but through the early part of the year, he was probably the best quarterback in football. Head coach Mike McCoy and Rivers is a match made in quick-decision, high-efficiency heaven, and when Antonio Gates returns from his suspension, San Diego will once again have its full arsenal of backyard football savants finding creases and just making shit happen. Running Back: Jamaal Charles, Kansas City Chiefs Charles’s place in the running back hierarchy is tough to pin down these days. He’s not a physical marvel like Adrian Peterson, and he doesn’t shatter spirits like Marshawn Lynch. He isn’t the next big thing anymore, either; that’s Le’Veon Bell. Yet Charles remains one of the four or five best backs in football, and somehow, it feels like he’s never gotten his proper due. No halfback in NFL history1 has averaged more yards per carry than Charles’s 5.5, and even though that number is helped by a few low-volume, high-efficiency seasons, Charles has yet to have a season you could legitimately describe as “bad.” On a per-carry basis, his worst year was last year, when he averaged exactly five yards per carry. And that was good for fourth among running backs with at least 100 attempts. When Charles is at his worst, he’s still better than just about everyone in football. The three players ahead of him were Justin Forsett, Jeremy Hill, and Lamar Miller, and those names bring up another fascinating part of how Charles has managed to do all of this. Forsett and Hill play behind two of the most frightening offensive lines in football. For almost his entire time in Kansas City, the line paving the way for Charles has been in constant flux, turning over players and struggling to find a group that can stick together for long stretches. Charles is the rare running back who makes his line look better, rather than the other way around. He transcends the talent up front. Peterson and Lynch can say that, too, but I’m not sure anyone else can. Wide Receiver: Dez Bryant, Dallas Cowboys It feels right when a potentially crazy, brash, physically dominant specimen wears no. 88 for the Cowboys, and for the past couple of years, Dez Bryant has earned the right to say whatever the hell he wants. Right now, there’s no better choice at the goal line than throwing the ball in Dez’s general vicinity and letting him do what he does. There are taller wide receivers in the league, but no one else can make cornerbacks look so small.  Poor, poor Bradley Fletcher. This was just the start of Fletcher’s no good, very long night, but it’s easily the most embarrassing moment of the game. The best part of this play is Dez pulling his left hand off the ball just a half second before it seems safe. It’s almost like he wants to show everyone just how easy this is for him — because it is. It’s such a complete manhandling that it’s almost hard to watch. Near the end zone, Dez has become unstoppable. We all know what’s coming once Dallas gets close enough, but that inevitably makes it even better. Wide Receiver: Steve Smith, Baltimore Ravens Are you ready? Are you ready for the carnage that will be the Steve Smith retirement tour? Over the past decade, few players have made the NFL more fun than Smith, who has defied every expectation since coming into the league as a third-round pick out of Utah and has never really stopped. Smith belongs in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, but really, we should put him in every Hall of Fame we can find. Let’s start with the Polka Hall of Fame in Cleveland and just work our way out from there. Offensive Line: Kelechi Osemele, Baltimore Ravens The man they call KO isn’t the best guard in the league; he isn’t even the best guard on his team. That would be Marshal Yanda, who’s essentially a human version of the boulder from Raiders of the Lost Ark. While Osemele might not be as consistent as his teammate, when he’s at his best he’s one of the most physically dominant players you’ll ever see. Few offensive linemen in the NFL — even the great ones — can manhandle their opponents to the point that the game tape looks like high school highlight film.  That’s what you get from Osemele, who regularly sends people into orbit. In 2013, he underwent back surgery he’d needed since his days at Iowa State. In his first two years in the NFL, he was constantly in pain and had trouble achieving anything close to full range of motion. Finally healthy, Osemele was the best he’s ever been last season, and when he’s on — like he was in Week 1 against the Bengals last year — no one drops the hammer like he does. Defensive Line: Aaron Donald, St. Louis Rams This may seem like a stretch, but by season’s end, Aaron Donald has a chance to be the best non–J.J. Watt defender in football. Comparing the two actually follows: Both were hyper-productive college players — Donald had 28.5 tackles for loss during his final year at Pitt — who absolutely ruined the combine and still somehow fell 10 spots too many when draft time came. As a rookie, Donald was more impressive than Watt was over his first full season. That, um, is not easy to do! He finished with nine sacks while barely playing half the Rams’ snaps for the first quarter of the season. Every pre-draft concern about Donald’s height was gone by November, and as happened so often in college, he was almost taking the handoff at least once a game come season’s end.  It just shouldn’t be possible to get into the backfield as fast as he does. Part of it is an amazing burst — Donald’s 1.59-second 10-yard dash puts him in the 100th percentile all-time among defensive tackles — but it’s also a product of craftiness you’d expect to see only from a 12-year veteran. Where Donald lines up pre-snap doesn’t always speak to where he’s going. Offensive linemen have to be on their heels, and against someone who moves like Donald does, that means it’s already over. If you don’t have DVR, rectify that before you watch the Rams this year. Donald will suddenly be on top of a quarterback and a running back, and you’ll need something slower than “real time” to figure out how he did it. J.J. Watt: J.J. Watt, Houston Texans It’s probably time to acknowledge that we’re seeing something very special here: a player make his case for the best stretch a defender has ever had in the history of the league. On today’s ‘Grantland NFL Podcast,’ Bill Barnwell asked me — if it were to all break right for Watt, if he had that extra step on every play — how many sacks Watt could get in a single season. We settled at around 30, which might sound crazy, but just consider that last year, Watt had 20.5 sacks and 51 quarterback hits. He is not of this world.  My favorite game of last season involved watching Watt terrorize EJ Manuel for an entire afternoon. He never sacked him — although he did hit him nine times and take a game-sealing interception back for a touchdown — but in a way, that’s what makes J.J. Watt the best football player on earth. He affects the game on every play, in ways both obvious and subtle. Check out how fast Manuel bails out of there when he sees Watt coming. He’s terrified. And can you blame him? At this point, Watt is borderline unblockable for most offensive linemen. There’s just no way to approach it without being one step behind — and sometimes, it’s two. He lined up at every spot along the defensive line during that manhandling of the Bills. It’s hard to know where he’s coming from or where he’s headed on any given play, but that’s what every quarterback is trying to figure out every single snap. There’s a reason Hard Knocks was full of so many clips of Watt doing everything from the impossible to the mundane. We can’t look away. And we shouldn’t. Linebacker: DeAndre Levy, Detroit Lions After being named second-team All-NFL and generally causing havoc for one of the league’s best defenses all season, DeAndre Levy spent his winter living the best life anyone has ever lived. It included — but was not limited to — skinny dipping in the Amazon, standing on top of an airborne plane, and sledding down a volcano in Nicaragua. People apparently sled down volcanoes. I don’t know. Of course, he had reason to celebrate. Levy has been an absolute terror his past couple of seasons in Detroit, and what’s scariest is that he does it in so many ways. He had six interceptions in 2013, and last year, he was one of the best run defenders in football.  The guy just moves, and at times, his combination of speed and ferocity seems like it’s a better fit for National Geographic than the NFL. Linebacker: Elvis Dumervil, Baltimore Ravens Without looking it up, guess how many sacks Elvis Dumervil had last year. Ten? Twelve? The answer is 17. No, really, it is. At age 30, Dumervil racked up 17 freaking sacks for Baltimore last year. Only Justin Houston and Watt had more. It’s hard to believe this will already be Dumervil’s ninth season, and his third since a bad trip to Kinko’s landed him in Baltimore. After his career at Louisville, there’s no way a pass-rushing master like him should have fallen to the fourth round, but in retrospect, it’s not that surprising. The NFL hates small, and at 5-foot-11, there just aren’t many successful edge rushers that look like Elvis Dumervil. Dumervil has 90 career sacks, 18.5 more than any player in NFL history 6 feet tall or shorter. And most of the players on that list aren’t even pass-rushers. Dumervil has made a career out of turning his height into an advantage instead of a weakness, and it’s why he remains my favorite pass-rusher ever. Blocking Dumervil is a chore for 6-6 tackles, mostly because getting down that low is a real pain in the ass. But Dumervil combines that leverage with a full array of moves that would make everyone but Dwight Freeney jealous. He’s one of the more unusual players to ever come through the league, and if last year is any indication, don’t expect him to go away anytime soon. Defensive Back: Tashaun Gipson, Cleveland Browns For the past two years, Gipson has been a constant cutaway-highlight presence in my life. It feels like he picks off a pass every week. He has 11 interceptions in the past two seasons, more than anyone in the league other than Richard Sherman. Where he blows his competitors away, though, is what he does with the ball after it gets in his hands. Gipson’s 301 turnover return yards are far and away the most since 2013.  As Gipson is a free safety, plenty of his interceptions are of the overthrow or tipped-pass variety, but there’s something to be said for always being in the right place at the right time. Lining up to block a field goal against the Raiders, as Oakland showed it was faking, Gipson moved from the right side of the line of scrimmage all the way to a free safety spot on the opposite side of the field before finally tracking back across to snatch the throw from Matt Schaub, who now throws picks as a holder, too. An undrafted free agent just three seasons ago, Gipson patrolled the second-best pass defense in football last year, and in a secondary that includes two former first-round picks, it’s the guy no one wanted who makes the biggest difference.",2015-09-08T13:42:24+00:00,2015 NFL Preview,Mays
135,A-Units: Six Positional Groups That Could Become the NFL’s Best in 2015,"Considering what the franchise had done over the past few years, it wasn’t difficult to imagine the Cowboys having the best offensive line in football last season. Using three first-round picks in a four-year span on the O-line was an obvious attempt to bolster one area of the team, and it ultimately paid off, as that group dominated up front in 2014 and took the Cowboys to the playoffs. Dallas’s continued development in the trenches puts it right in the conversation with the other top position groups in the league: the Legion of Boom, the Green Bay wide receivers, and the Carolina linebackers. Every year, there’s at least one Cowboys O-line — a unit that ascends to the top of the pecking order at its position, redefining the team’s identity and what its outlook is by the end of the season. So, a week out (!) from the start of this season, let’s take a look at the six position groups that have the best chance to be called the best in football come Week 17. 2014 Winner: Dallas Cowboys 2015 Challenger: Baltimore Ravens Dethroning Dallas is going to be a tall task. Unlike some of the other great (and healthy) lines from last season — Green Bay, Pittsburgh — the Cowboys maintained their excellence despite injuries. And now with undrafted first-round talent La’el Collins sitting on their bench, they’re in a better spot to handle bad luck than most lines in the league. More 2015 NFL PreviewIt's almost here.

Team Predictions: The Contenders Team Predictions: The Rising Team Predictions: Falling Stars Team Predictions: Cellar-Dwellers Can Chip Kelly Save Sam Bradford? The Curious Case of Jay Cutler Have We Seen Beckham's Best? The Tackle-to-Guard Conversion Antonio Brown and Shrinking WRs Joe Thomas, Cleveland's Rock Ascending Pass-Rushers to Watch The Value of Tom Brady The All-Bad-Contracts Team The NFL 100 Rankings, Part 1 The NFL 100 Rankings, Part 2 All of our NFL preview coverage! If any group has a chance to challenge the Cowboys, though, it’s the Ravens. Baltimore dealt with its own injury issues last season, when a foot problem sent right tackle Ricky Wagner to the IR late in the year. Rather than letting undrafted rookie James Hurst get roasted on the outside, the Ravens slid All-World guard Marshal Yanda to tackle, where he just kept on ruining opponents’ afternoons. It takes one hand to count the number of guys who can do that, and I think Yanda is the best offensive lineman playing right now. He’s a savant in the run game, often getting a hand or a hip on a guy (or two) that he has no business reaching — all while still being a rock in pass protection, too. Schematically, though, the Ravens’ zone-running game starts with Jeremy Zuttah. Even with all of Ozzie Newsome’s other transactional wizardry, the move for Zuttah is still one of his best. Baltimore snatched the undersize center from the Bucs for a fifth-round pick before last season, and he proved to be a perfect fit for Gary Kubiak’s offense. Under Kubiak in Houston, Chris Myers made a living as a 280-pound center that survived on quickness and an understanding of angles, and the (maybe) 300-pound Zuttah cuts his path the same way. With Yanda on one side and Kelechi Osemele — at times, the most physically punishing guard in football — on the other, it makes for the best interior of any line in the league. The trade for Zuttah was part of the mass turnover needed after Baltimore posted some historically bad rushing numbers in 2013. The Ravens finished last in rushing DVOA that season and 30th in average yards before contact. Last year, their DVOA jumped 14 spots, and only the Chiefs and Dolphins averaged more yards before contact. Zuttah deserves some of that credit, but a full offseason for Eugene Monroe and sliding Wagner to tackle also had plenty to do with it. Wagner has developed into one of the league’s top right tackles, and although Monroe, who came over in a trade with Jacksonville, has never lived up to his eighth-overall-pick status, he’s a more than capable option on the other side. What makes this group unique (especially when compared with Dallas) is that it’s been pieced together over time without any of Baltimore’s own early-round picks. Of course, there’s some luck involved — like Wagner, a fifth-round compensatory pick, turning into a star — but Newsome and the rest of the Ravens staff deserve a lot of credit for understanding how important a great line is and for tinkering just enough until they found one. Jon Durr/Getty Images 2014 Winner: You tell me! 2015 Challenger: Philadelphia Eagles It would make sense to exclude this position from the list for the same reason we left off quarterback — it’s mainly one guy — but running backs are a little different than signal-callers. Backfield attrition makes depth there more important than it is under center, and in an era when specialists matter more than ever, having a group of backs with diversified skills is a necessity. That being said, picking a consensus best backfield from last year was, well, it was not possible. Most of the better backs in football — Le’Veon Bell, Jamaal Charles, Marshawn Lynch — were backed up by a decidedly worse one, and I can’t give it to Minnesota after Adrian Peterson missed most of the season. The Bengals have a decent case, but I’d like to see Jeremy Hill for a few more games before I’m ready to hand that title to him and Giovani Bernard. As far as this year goes, though, it’s tough not to like the group the Eagles are trotting out. Sure, you can quibble with how much they cost, but that doesn’t matter when we’re talking about on-field production. Even if DeMarco Murray does get hurt, that’s why Ryan Mathews is here. Mathews was a solid runner when healthy in San Diego, and in this offense he’ll be a reliable option whenever he gets the chance. The pair provides a dangerous one-two punch that could even see some time on the field together — and that’s before you consider what Darren Sproles provides in the passing game. With that trio, the Eagles have a group that’s both deep and effective in a few different ways. No other team can make the same claim. 2014 Winner: Green Bay Packers 2015 Challenger: Detroit Lions If everyone were healthy, I don’t know if it would even be worth trying to find a team to surpass the Packers. There might be a larger gap between Green Bay’s pass-catchers, which includes Eddie Lacy, who is a horribly underrated receiver, and the rest of the league than there is with any other position group. Only, Jordy Nelson’s stupid knee ligaments now give a few other teams a shot. It’s tempting to choose Pittsburgh here. When it comes to top-level talent, the Steelers have most of it. Antonio Brown is the most effective receiver in football, and Le’Veon Bell is far and away the best pass-catching back in the league. ???? RT @ExcuseMyStep: ""@L_Bell26: 1on1's…iron sharpening iron! #Juice pic.twitter.com/yAUMStBqqv"" Oh yeah! ?? Don't sleep on Le'Veon! — Le'Veon Bell (@L_Bell26) August 7, 2015  Seriously, good luck with that. However, the Steelers don’t have a ton of depth. Martavis Bryant has looked magnificent at times, both last season and in the preseason, but he’s going to miss the first four games of the year through suspension. Behind him, it feels like Markus Wheaton is destined for the never-ending “This is finally the year!” treatment every offseason, and rookie Sammie Coates appears to have a long way to go before he’s a realistic option. Detroit has its own questions, but with a little bit of projection, it’s not hard to picture that group taking the top spot. Calvin Johnson was slowed down by injury last year, but even if we can’t discount his injury history, 14 healthy games of Megatron still rivals just about anyone. Across from him, Golden Tate looks like one of the shrewdest free-agent signings in recent memory after a 99-reception year in 2014. The array of elements Tate brings as a receiver is crazy: He’s a deep threat, a yards-after-catch monster, and one of the more sure-handed players in the entire league. Plus, only Rob Gronkowski, Dez Bryant, and Martellus Bennett — all giant human beings — had more broken tackles for a receiver than Tate last season, per Football Outsiders. The Johnson-Tate duo rivals anyone else in the league, but it’s the other pieces that aren’t quite there yet. We don’t have much reason to believe Eric Ebron will be more of a factor in his second season, but he’s still the 10th overall pick from only a year ago. There’s talent there, and the Lions do need a third option to eat up some targets. Also, if the preseason is any indication, Ameer Abdullah can do a few things with the ball in his hands. Please show us you deserve all of this, Matthew Stafford. Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images 2014 Winner: Buffalo Bills or St. Louis Rams 2015 Challenger: Miami Dolphins We could give 2014 to Buffalo and, with the addition of Nick Fairley and the return of a healthy Chris Long, call 2015 for St. Louis. But that feels like cheating. The point here is to pinpoint a unit that can overtake the no. 1 spot, and even if Buffalo was the best group last year, St. Louis currently has a firm grasp on the top spot. Miami is a little further down in the pecking order, but there’s a chance this crew matches anything the Rams or Bills do this year. The production Ndamukong Suh adds is obvious. He’s a dominant interior pass-rusher who can play anywhere on the inside, and he should ensure that Miami’s run defense doesn’t crater like it did in the second half of last season. What makes Suh truly valuable, though, is how he frees up the rest of this line. We’ve already seen it with Earl Mitchell, an underrated penetrator who picked up two tackles for loss and a sack against the Falcons last week. Mitchell can be a mismatch when single-blocked, and with Suh next to him, that shouldn’t be a rarity. Any extra attention paid to Mitchell will also mean fewer resources devoted to the outside, where Cameron Wake still lurks. Wake is 33, but before he got dinged up last year, he still looked like the explosive nightmare he’s been since coming into the league. If he has lost anything, Suh’s presence should be enough to make up for any drop in raw ability. Wake has never played with a player even approaching Suh’s level, and for years, opponents have been able to devote entire protection schemes to keeping him off the quarterback. Now, he’s the second-most dangerous player on his own line. Add double-digit sack threat Olivier Vernon, who is somehow an afterthought here, to the mix, and that’s a scary group. 2014 Winner: Carolina Panthers 2015 Winner: Philadelphia Eagles At linebacker, Carolina has had a similar stranglehold to what the healthy Packers enjoy at receiver, and it’s possible that group gets even stronger with rookie Shaq Thompson in the mix. Philadelphia’s unit still might be better, though. DeMeco Ryans is listed as the starter opposite Kiko Alonso on the inside, but go take a look at the money Chip Kelly just threw at Mychal Kendricks. Alonso and Kendricks are getting the snaps here, and man, those two can fly around. This year’s Eagles actually have a lot in common with the Panthers defenses from the past couple of seasons. Philly’s front four is a talented, deep group. The pass rush isn’t going to be a problem, and there’s still enough heft in the middle to slow down the run. Like Carolina, Philadelphia’s issues are in the secondary, especially at safety. That makes what Alonso and Kendricks can do in coverage even more important. They’ll rival Luke Kuechly and Thomas Davis as the best pair of coverage linebackers in football, and there’s a real chance they’re even better. Oh, and that’s not even mentioning Connor Barwin, who’s asked to do a little bit of everything and does much of it well. Hannah Foslien/Getty Images 2014 (and 2013 and 2012) Winner: Seattle Seahawks 2015 Challenger: Minnesota Vikings I know, I know. This title will belong to another team when it’s pried from the Legion of Boom’s cold, dead fingers. But this year looks like it could provide a bigger opening than there’s been in a while. Kam Chancellor is still missing from camp, pissed off about a deal he signed before every other Seahawk really cashed in. Seattle’s relying on Cary Williams as its outside corner across from Richard Sherman, and at a certain point, we have to stop assuming that putting on that jersey is enough to turn anyone into a reasonable NFL cornerback. Meanwhile, Earl Thomas was just cleared to start playing with contact. So, all I ask is for you to at least hear me out with the Vikings. Cleveland has a claim here, but Minnesota’s ceiling is considerably higher. If the Vikings can make a push for the playoffs, Harrison Smith should finally start to get some recognition this year, as he deserves mention right alongside Devin McCourty and Eric Weddle as the best safety in football not named Earl Thomas. Captain Munnerlyn was the no. 1 cornerback on an excellent Panthers team two years ago, and for Mike Zimmer, he’s destined for life in the slot. That’s a luxury most teams don’t have, but on the outside, former first-round pick Xavier Rhodes is set to take a giant leap right into the class occupied by players like Desmond Trufant, Vontae Davis, and Jimmy Smith. If it all breaks the right way, Trae Waynes will be a reliable no. 2 corner by the end of the season. The 11th overall pick has some work to do before he’s there, but Minnesota’s plan isn’t hard to see: The Vikings know they have the pieces in place, and with the talent and depth they have in the front four, they were another high-quality cornerback away from having a top-level pass defense. Much of the excitement in Minnesota is around the development of Teddy Bridgewater and the return of Peterson because of course it is. But in his first year, Zimmer took the Vikings from 30th in pass-defense DVOA up to 19th. While a challenge to Seattle might still be a bit much to ask, another even bigger leap into the top five isn’t at all beyond this secondary’s ability.",2015-09-04T10:55:17+00:00,2015 NFL Preview,Mays
136,Sam’s Savior: Why Chip Kelly’s Plan to Revive Sam Bradford Just Might Work,"In the wake of Chip Kelly’s trade for Sam Bradford, there were plenty of efforts to figure out what Kelly saw that others hadn’t. To get Bradford from the Rams, the Eagles had to part with Nick Foles, a starter who was 14-4 under Kelly — with better career numbers than Bradford in nearly every area — and a pair of draft picks.1 At the time, it could have been construed as a lateral move for too high a price. But the way Kelly saw it, at least it was a move, and maybe just the sort Philadelphia needed if the team was going to take that final step toward becoming a true contender. “Ten wins … has it been fun that we took over a 4-12 team that has won 20 games in the past two years?” Kelly said in an interview with CSN’s Derrick Gunn. “We went from 4-12 to 20-12, but we still haven’t won a playoff game and we understand that. We’ve got to get better and we’re always going to strive … the one thing I can promise is that we’re not going to just sit there and hopefully in a couple of years we’re going to build this thing.” More 2015 NFL PreviewIt's almost here.

Team Predictions: The Contenders Team Predictions: The Rising Team Predictions: Falling Stars Team Predictions: Cellar-Dwellers Can Chip Kelly Save Sam Bradford? The Curious Case of Jay Cutler Have We Seen Beckham's Best? The Tackle-to-Guard Conversion Antonio Brown and Shrinking WRs Joe Thomas, Cleveland's Rock Ascending Pass-Rushers to Watch The Value of Tom Brady The All-Bad-Contracts Team The NFL 100 Rankings, Part 1 The NFL 100 Rankings, Part 2 All of our NFL preview coverage! Kelly’s approach this offseason — wheeling and dealing like few personnel people ever have — has looked insane at times. Plenty of coaches with 20 wins in two years would feel comfortable moving forward with a familiar quantity at quarterback. But the thinking behind the move for Bradford was a bold and commendable one — it seems that Kelly was projecting that both Bradford and his offense could be better than anyone imagined. It’s still (extremely) early, but the factors that could have led an optimistic person to feel good about how Bradford might translate to Kelly’s style have been on display all preseason. The inhuman accuracy from his first two college seasons — when he completed a combined 68.5 percent of his passes — has been there in both of his preseason starts. Bradford’s 10-for-10 line on Saturday was impressive, but seeing him perfectly locate throws to receivers in reasonably tight coverage was even more encouraging. If his ball placement is on, the simple decisions and quick tempo in Kelly’s offense could help turn Bradford into the point guard/distributor he was allowed to be in Norman; it’s his best chance to become what St. Louis envisioned when it selected him with the no. 1 pick five years ago. Bradford is still a long way from proving he’s the player we’ve seen for 15 throws and not the one we saw in 49 starts with the Rams. But if he can stay healthy, his 2015 season has a chance to be the test case for two quarterback theories that other decision-makers are sure to consider moving forward. The state of quarterback play in the NFL has led to a lot of speculation about why a country of 321 million people can’t produce 32 competent starting quarterbacks. The proliferation of spread offenses has gotten much of the blame, but maybe the lack of success has as much to do with a shortage of suitable environments as it does with a dearth of talent. The most obvious upgrade for Bradford is the coaching staff. Eagles offensive coordinator Pat Shurmur held the same position with the Rams during Bradford’s rookie season, but we have two notes there. First, Bradford was OK as a rookie! Six yards per attempt and a completion percentage of 60 are on the low end of competency, but that’s where most quarterbacks are hanging out as rookies. Second, we can call Shurmur whatever we want. This is Kelly’s offense, and it’s hard to imagine a more significant creativity gap than the one between Kelly and Brian Schottenheimer. But Kelly’s reputation as a mad scientist isn’t what matters here. Go read anything Chris Brown has ever written about Kelly. It’s not that any individual part of what Kelly’s doing is revolutionary; it’s that when it all comes together, it combines to make the jobs of his players easier. So far, that’s what we’ve seen with Bradford, and it makes it tough to not wonder how other quarterbacks might have fared if given a second chance at life in the league. If Matt Leinart had played for Kelly — and Leinart’s knack for quick decision-making and ball placement had been considered more important than the big arm Ken Whisenhunt has always seemed to crave — could it all have been different? Going the other way, it’s possible to imagine that if Robert Griffin III hadn’t landed with a coordinator willing to completely tailor his offense to Griffin’s skills, he never would have been rookie of the year, and we wouldn’t be having this conversation. If Tom Brady had been asked to play the same role in the Patriots’ scheme in 2001 that he was in 2007, there’s a reasonable chance he never would’ve become the player we know now. This is the Sliding Doors principle of NFL quarterbacks. Coaching quality and scheme are part of it, but it’s also fair to say Bradford will have more talent around him in Philadelphia than he ever had in St. Louis. Playing quarterback in the NFL — and for any quarterback drafted in the first round, likely playing as a rookie — is difficult enough, let alone having to play it without much help. It’s an incredibly steep learning curve, and providing hospitable conditions to figure this stuff out is a fragile process. David Carr — sacked a record 76 times as a rookie in 2002 — will always be the most famous example, but looking at this list of players dumped most in a single season during their first three years, you can see it’s a group filled with highly drafted disappointments. Tim Couch, Ken O’Brien, Tony Eason, and Jeff George may never have been high-quality NFL starters, but getting turned into a pile of bones before reaching quarterbacking maturity certainly didn’t help. An epidemic of drops can have a similar, albeit less damning effect. But no matter the ailment, it isn’t difficult to trace why so many pedigreed quarterbacks fail. Most starting quarterbacks are first-round picks, and plenty of them are taken near the top of the draft. In the past 15 years, 19 of the 75 players picked in the top five are quarterbacks. That’s four more than at any other position, and it’s worth noting that historically, it’s recommended that a team play with two tackles. The commonality between teams that finish in the top five of the draft is that often they aren’t very good. That leads to young quarterbacks — highly drafted Heisman winners and physical marvels often billed as franchise saviors — walking into rough situations they’re expected to weather from day one. You can see how we got in this rut. That brings us back to Bradford, and, by extension, back to Kelly. “If you want to play with the odds as we want to play, it’s got to be with a quarterback situation and then the only way you’re going to get a quarterback is you got to be really not very good so you finish in the top 1-2 in the draft,” Kelly told Gunn. “If we’re not very good and we finish with the top 1-2 in the draft, I don’t think I’m going to be here, so we better find another way to find a quarterback. And that’s what we did with Sam.” There are more blueprints for long-term NFL success than there are in the NBA, but in broad terms, Kelly’s right. Quarterback so far outweighs the rest of the positions that finding a quality one is still the most important move a franchise can make, and when playing the numbers, more of those quarterbacks are found near the top of the draft than anywhere else. Ideally, Kelly’s plan with Bradford was to break the cycle altogether, to steal a quarterback who was actually worthy of going no. 1 overall but hadn’t shown it because he’d never been given the chance. Looking at the NFL’s traditional draft value chart, the projected picks and Foles (the 88th pick) come out to about 600 points — equivalent to a late first-round pick. The deal essentially allowed Kelly to take a player of Bradford’s pedigree with the 28th pick, something he never would have been able to do five years ago. Even after what Bradford and the Eagles offense have done this preseason, the future is unknown. The preseason is meaningless, Bradford’s injury history is undeniable, and there’s a chance that when the speed and complexity pick up next week, the same bouts of inaccuracy that plagued him in St. Louis return. But if that doesn’t happen, if Bradford plays a full season and at least some of what we’ve seen in August carries over, there’s also a chance Bradford becomes a new benchmark in quarterback acquisition and evaluation. NFL coaches already have a tendency to believe they can finally be the one to unearth the massive potential of early-drafted busts. And if Chip Kelly provides a fresh example, that certainly isn’t going to change.",2015-09-02T08:55:29+00:00,2015 NFL Preview,Mays
137,Career Arc: The Collateral Damage of Smokin’ Jay Cutler,"Everything I remember about the afternoon Jay Cutler was traded reminds me just how much it meant to Bears fans. I was a college junior, sitting in the newsroom at the Columbia Missourian, pounding away at a keyboard. I can still recall the exact computer I was using when I hit ESPN.com and saw the news on the front page. Not much work got done over the next hour, or for the few after that. I went out with friends that evening and was in such a good mood that I spent most of the night trying not to let it end. I had a flight to Detroit the next morning for the Final Four. It was a miracle that I didn’t miss it. More 2015 NFL PreviewIt's almost here. For everything you need to know about the new season, follow all of Grantland's coverage.

The list of attributes that would make Cutler a savior has been rattled off, reorganized, and reiterated so many times that it isn’t worth repeating. Chicago was a quarterback-starved franchise whose futility at the position rivaled that of any team in history; Cutler was a 25-year-old gunslinger fresh off a trip to the Pro Bowl and a 4,500-yard season. Even if there was some concern about the petulance he showed during his last days in Denver, Bears fans were willing to deal with a quarterback who threw fits as long as he could also throw a football. Somehow, nearly six and a half years have passed since that jubilant April night. From the moment Cutler posed with Lovie Smith and Jerry Angelo for the first time at Halas Hall, the Bears have hired two new head coaches, two new general managers, and five offensive coordinators. Cutler has taken Chicago to the playoffs once, the same number of trips Rex Grossman and Kyle Orton delivered during their seasons as the team’s starting quarterback. My father always had a handle on quarterbacks in a way I never quite understood. He called it from the start with Ben Roethlisberger, preferred Philip Rivers to Eli Manning, and said that he knew from Aaron Rodgers’s first game that he would be a star. A few minutes after I saw the news of the Cutler trade, I called him from the newsroom. “Well,” I said, “it looks like the Bears finally got their quarterback.” “You know,” he said, half talking, half sighing, “I’m not so sure they did.” As Chicago prepares for its seventh season with Cutler under center, it might be time to admit that my father was right. Knowing what we do now, Ron Jaworski’s stance on the 2006 quarterback draft class makes sense. But at the time, it seemed like a radical notion. The former Eagle joined analysts like Mike Mayock and Steve Young in championing Cutler — and not national champions Matt Leinart and Vince Young — as the best quarterback available that spring. Leinart and Young were four months removed from what might have been the greatest game in college football history, played on the biggest stage imaginable. Cutler’s chance at a bowl game with Vanderbilt ended with a loss to Kentucky. Both Leinart and Young won more games in 2005 than Cutler did in his entire college career. Doug Pensinger/Getty Images Cutler at Vanderbilt in 2005. By the time the draft came, Cutler’s lack-of-college-success narrative had been spun the other way. Everything he’d accomplished at Vanderbilt — where he was the SEC Offensive Player of the Year in 2005 — was done without much help. He’d dragged the Commodores to a win over Tennessee and almost single-handedly taken Florida to the brink. He didn’t have the flashy appeal or name recognition of Leinart or Young, but he did have a killer arm and a willingness to use it. “From a physical skill set, I think Cutler has the biggest arm in the draft,” NFL Network’s Mayock told USA Today at the time. “I think he has a quicker release than either of the other two. He’s tough. I think he played behind a very poor offensive line without a whole lot of help … When I look at that kid and what he did on tape, he can make throws that I don’t think the other two kids can make.” Reports the week of the draft linked as many as six different teams to Cutler. Titans general manager Floyd Reese had taken advantage of Cutler living just down the road in Nashville and met with him several times. The Jets were rumored to be interested, and their acquisition of the 29th overall pick — from Denver in a three-way trade — gave them the ammunition to move up in the draft. When the time came, though, it was the Broncos who did the dealing. Denver gave up a fourth-round pick to swap places with the Rams and take Cutler 11th overall. It took less than three months for Cutler to supplant Jake Plummer, who’d made the previous 46 starts at quarterback for Denver but was mired in the worst stretch of his career. The Broncos were 39-15 in the regular season with Plummer as the starter, but the thought — the one that inspired the drafting of Cutler in the first place — was that the ceiling for their young quarterback was markedly higher. Cutler’s first two seasons as a starter were promising but unremarkable — then, in 2008, circumstances aligned that made him an attractive and available option. With a porous defense in Denver, Cutler was forced into throwing 616 passes in 2008, which meant pumped-up totals across the board. He threw for 4,526 yards and 25 touchdowns, though he did so while throwing touchdowns less often and averaging fewer yards per attempt. When Mike Shanahan lost his job at the end of the season, the Broncos brought in former Patriots offensive coordinator and offensive wunderkind Josh McDaniels. That’s when the trouble began. Sporting News via Getty Images Cutler in Denver in 2008. According to what Cutler’s agent, Bus Cook, told the Associated Press, the Broncos were looking to deal Cutler in a move that would bring Matt Cassel with McDaniels from New England. Cutler reacted in the way we’d now expect Jay Cutler to react. He reportedly requested a trade before cutting off communication with McDaniels and owner Pat Bowlen — an accusation Cutler has denied. “I don’t care if you’re talking about trading him for Matt Cassel, Matt Ryan or Tom Brady,” Cook told the AP. “That’s a vote of no confidence in him, and that’s how Jay sees it, and I would, too.” Cutler would say later that he never asked for a trade. McDaniels told the Denver Post, “We don’t want to trade Jay. We never did. He’s our quarterback.” Less than 40 days later, Cutler was gone, off to Chicago for a king’s ransom. As overjoyed as many Bears fans were, the delight didn’t seem to extend to the Chicago locker room, including the notoriously blunt Brian Urlacher. “I guess the Bears felt like we needed another quarterback, so they made a move,” Urlacher told the Chicago Tribune. “They gave up a lot. Cutler must be pretty good.” ??? Jerry Angelo, the Bears general manager for 11 years and the man responsible for bringing Cutler to Chicago, spoke of the trade in the way most Bears fans did. “The rarity of the opportunity makes it unique,” he said to the Chicago Sun-Times. Potential franchise quarterbacks not yet 26 years old don’t become available often. If the Broncos were dangling Cutler, Angelo was at least obligated to call. When it became clear Denver was serious, Angelo was rightly inclined to match its tone. “We felt if we get in it, we have to get in it to win it,” Angelo told the Sun-Times. The price was steep — two first-round picks, a third-round pick, and Kyle Orton for Cutler and a fifth-rounder — but so was the descent into madness facing the Bears and their fan base if they had to endure yet another era of quarterback mediocrity. The opportunity, as Angelo reminded everyone, was unique. From the start, that first season with the Bears was a nightmare. Cutler threw four interceptions in the opener during a game Chicago lost by only six points. It was only the start of the bad news for Lovie Smith’s group that night. Urlacher’s dislocated wrist meant he’d miss the remainder of the season, and with that, a low point of Smith’s tenure in Chicago began. The Bears defense went from one of the best units in football to a below-average bunch, and Cutler’s ghoulish start against the Packers was only the first of plenty that season. He finished the year with 26 interceptions, throwing multiple picks in seven of his 16 starts. Heads rolled at season’s end. Ron Turner, unable to coax the most out of his shiny new quarterback, was fired, along with most of his offensive staff. It was the beginning of the cruel cycle the Bears have seen with their offensive coordinators. With Turner gone, Smith turned to former Rams colleague Mike Martz. Smith had finally eschewed the safer option typical of defensive head coaches in favor of a true offensive innovator, a mind more fitting for Cutler’s ability and the Bears’ offensive potential. Looking back, it was hard to argue. The Bears won plenty in 2010, but most of that success had little to do with Martz and the Chicago offense. A year after trading for Cutler, the Bears made another offseason splash by signing Julius Peppers, who — along with the return of a healthy Urlacher — reignited the Bears defense. Chicago finished fourth in defensive DVOA after dropping to 21st the year before, and it rode that group to an 11-5 record and a division title while the offense sputtered. The Bears finished in the bottom five in offensive DVOA, mostly due to the epic pounding Cutler took in Martz’s deep-drop, slow-developing system. He was sacked 52 times, the most in the league, and the Bears’ sack rate of 10.1 percent that season is the second highest in football since Cutler arrived in Chicago.1 Watching the beating Cutler took that year only made the most divisive moment of his Bears career even more complicated. ??? There are two moments that will haunt anyone invested in the Cutler era, and the first — famously — came in the NFC Championship Game against the Packers during his second season. After spraining his knee in the first half, Cutler lasted only one series after halftime. The Bears tossed out a worthless Todd Collins before pulling him for Caleb Hanie, and the results were predictable. There was no offense to be had, and the Chicago defense holding Aaron Rodgers & Co. to just 21 points came in vain. As the Bears stalled over and over, Cutler stood wrapped in a jacket on the sideline, absorbing a barrage of criticism. Darnell Dockett tweeted that if he were a Bear, Cutler would have to “wait till me and the team shower get dressed and leave before he comes in the locker room!” Maurice-Jones Drew was similarly critical. A day later, Mike Ditka and others piled on. For anyone who’d watched the Bears all season, calling Cutler’s toughness into question was next to impossible. He’d spent most of the year picking grass out of his face mask. “Jay was hurt,” Urlacher said at the time. “I don’t question his toughness. He’s tough as hell. He’s one of the toughest guys on our football team. He doesn’t bitch. He doesn’t complain when he gets hit. He goes out there and plays his ass off every Sunday. He practices every single day. So, no, we don’t question his toughness.” The knee would have mattered less if not for the thumb. After missing their chance to go to the Super Bowl, the Bears started 7-3 in Cutler’s third season in Chicago. His numbers weren’t demonstrably better than they’d been in his previous two seasons — his completion percentage dipped from 60.4 to 58, with his yards per attempt also taking a slight drop — but there was one key difference. The Bears weren’t turning the ball over. In his 10 starts, Cutler threw an interception on just 2.2 percent of his throws, easily the best mark of his career. With Smith’s defense again finishing near the top of the league, an offense with fewer mistakes was enough to keep Chicago afloat. The Bears were on their way to their seventh win of the year when Cutler threw an interception late against the Chargers. This play was costlier than just a turnover, though: Cutler was blocked while pursuing the defender and broke his right thumb. He was done for the year. With Hanie forced under center, the Bears finished 1-5 and started what would become a four-year playoff drought. Leon Halip/Getty Images Cutler in a loss at Detroit last season. Anyone seeking an excuse for Cutler’s middling play during his first few seasons in Chicago had plenty of places to look. The offensive line was a mess, but his receiving options may have been worse. Johnny Knox was an exciting down-the-field option but little else. Roy Williams was two lifetimes from being a real threat. Rashied Davis was a career special-teams player, and, maybe worst of all, this was the stretch when the Bears were convinced that Devin Hester had a future as a no. 1 receiver. After a five-game skid without Cutler cost the Bears a playoff trip in 2011, the shuffling really began. Almost the entirety of the Bears’ offensive roster and front office would change over the next two years. Angelo was the first to go. The verdict was still out on his Cutler experiment, but his draft record was etched in stone. He may have delivered a talented quarterback, but from both a personnel and coaching standpoint, he’d done little to give Cutler the best chance to flourish. Former Bears scout Phil Emery was hired as Angelo’s replacement, and he spent the next 18 months making every possible move to transform the franchise into an environment where Cutler could thrive. Emery traded two third-round picks for former Cutler favorite Brandon Marshall, just two months before drafting South Carolina wide receiver Alshon Jeffery. When that wasn’t enough to jump-start the Chicago offense — and the Bears missed the playoffs despite winning 10 games in 2012 — Emery fired Lovie Smith and replaced him with supposed quarterback guru Marc Trestman. Before the 2013 season, tight end Martellus Bennett and left tackle Jermon Bushrod were signed to significant free-agent deals, and Kyle Long was taken in the first round to help bolster the offensive line. In less than two years, Emery had changed the entire fabric of the Bears organization in an effort to do what Angelo and Smith never could. In a way, Emery achieved his goal. With Trestman in charge, the Bears offense reached heights it never did under Smith. Marshall was undeniably a star, and Jeffery ascended in his second season. Cutler’s 67.1 QBR was his best mark since his final season in Denver. Still, it wouldn’t have been a year with Jay Cutler if there weren’t some sort of turmoil. After Cutler went down in the middle of the season with a torn groin, career backup Josh McCown posted a 109.0 passer rating, throwing 13 touchdowns to just one interception. When the time came for Cutler to return, there was debate about whether Chicago was right to roll with McCown or hand the keys back to its supposed franchise quarterback. Trestman elected to return to Cutler, but the Bears stumbled down the stretch, dropping a Week 17 game to Green Bay that cost them a trip to the postseason. Jonathan Daniel/Getty Images Trestman in happier days. Even five years in, there was still reason to believe that 2014 would be different for Cutler. He was in his second year of Trestman’s impressive-looking offense, all of whose personnel was returning from the previous season. With Marshall and Jeffery making up one of the best receiver pairings in football, the deficiencies of Cutler’s help seemed to be a thing of the past. Hopeful that with the rest of the pieces in place, Cutler would finally be something close to the player he and others had hoped, Emery handed his quarterback a seven-year, $126 million contract with $54 million in guarantees that gave him the largest cap hit of any player in football. At the time, it was considered the cost of doing business, a notion confirmed with all of the quarterback contracts that have been handed out since. With the outlook for the Chicago offense, Cutler may not have been able to live up to every dollar of the deal, but there was still a chance he’d be the type of franchise quarterback worthy of the going price for one. And that’s what made last season even more of a nightmare. In his first 10 starts, Cutler threw 12 interceptions. But the dysfunction extended far beyond his play. It got so bad inside the Bears organization that offensive coordinator Aaron Kromer anonymously trashed Cutler to Ian Rapoport of the NFL Network. When it was discovered that Kromer was the source of the comments, it led to a tearful apology in front of the entire team, which Cutler reportedly met with scoffs and head shakes. Trestman eventually benched Cutler for Jimmy Clausen in a move that made little sense and was far too little, far too late. The Kromer story was the cratering point of a disastrous season, which ended with both Emery and Trestman losing their jobs for the same reason so many before them had. They’d put their faith in Cutler, and that faith turned out to be unwarranted. “I haven’t been able [to coax the best from Cutler] and we haven’t been able to do the things that we want to get done,” Trestman said two weeks before he was let go. “We’re working towards that. But the answer to that is obvious. I’m trying to give you the most truthful answer and that is, we’ve seen moments of it, but it’s not where we need to go. It’s not where we need to be. But it’s not all about Jay. It’s about our entire offense, working together to get it done.” Despite a handful of other moves that brought the Bears some of their best offensive talent in team history, Emery was gone, too, paying for his decision to tie both his and the franchise’s fortunes to Cutler. And now the new regime of Ryan Pace and John Fox will attempt to do what those before them couldn’t. To new offensive coordinator Adam Gase’s credit, he’s been more tempered than some of his predecessors in proclamations about unlocking the mystery that is Jay Cutler. “Right now, time will tell,” Gase told Dan Wiederer of the Chicago Tribune when asked about Cutler. “If I knew what was going to happen, I’d play the lottery. Right now I don’t know.” With Cutler’s massive deal still on the books for this season, the Bears were almost certainly tied to him for 2015, and with $10 million of his contract guaranteed for next year, there’s a chance it will be at least another two years before Chicago can realistically move on. Not even the Titans were interested in Cutler when the Bears reportedly called before the draft, and it’s hard to blame them. Six years ago, when Angelo pulled the trigger on the deal to bring Cutler aboard, legendary Chicago sportswriter Rick Telander wrote in the Sun-Times that the Cutler trade “will be the one Angelo rides to enshrinement or out of town on a rail.” It was true for Angelo, and it’s been true for every regime since. Maybe this one will be different. Then again, maybe it won’t. As for Cutler, there’s no scale for measuring his capacity for boorishness at times of crisis. During a 2011 Sunday Night Football broadcast, he responded to a play call by looking to the sideline and yelling, “Tell Martz I say ‘Fuck him.’” When J’Marcus Webb did all he could to get Cutler decapitated against the Packers early in the 2012 season, Cutler gave Webb enough of a nudge on the sideline to make people take notice. And away from the field, there’s the maybe-apocryphal story — one Cutler hasn’t entirely denied — about him tilting his head back and letting out a deeply apathetic “Don’t caaaaare” as a fan tried to approach him in a bathroom. For Bears fans, it can all lead to a vexing combination of feelings about a quarterback who seems part insufferable asshole and part quick-witted smartass. We like that Cutler can hold his own on The League, that he’s married to a reality TV star, and that he’s willing to tell off his boss with impunity. When Cutler was stringing together wins for the Bears as they started 7-3 in 2011, I wrote that if Cutler was an asshole, “at least he was our asshole,” doing my best to communicate the complicated process of rooting for a quarterback who could at once infuriate a city while inspiring its fans to come to his defense. You don’t need to go back very far to find the latest saga in conflicted Cutler fandom. Against the Colts in last Saturday’s meaningless preseason game, after an offseason that featured Cutler being verbally stoned by just about everyone, he bowled over a safety near the goal line as he rumbled toward the end zone. Later that night, a friend of mine said that when Cutler lowered his shoulder, everyone in the room leaped from their seats. For years, through the interceptions, through the body language, and through the fury, Cutler constantly — and at times, maliciously — has found a way to keep Bears fans coming back.",2015-08-26T08:05:37+00:00,2015 NFL Preview,Mays
138,Antonio Brown and the Incredible Shrinking Wide Receiver,"No matter how you look at it, fantasy football belonged to the little guy last season. Antonio Brown, all 5-foot-10 of him, destroyed the rest of the wide receiver field by nearly two full games’ worth of points. The 5-foot-11 Odell Beckham Jr. averaged 17 points in his 12 games, the most of any receiver by far. For the season, Beckham finished fifth in total points among receivers, just ahead of Randall Cobb and Emmanuel Sanders, both of whom check in just shy of 6-foot.

Expand the scope a bit further, and the ridiculousness of Brown’s 2014 campaign only grows. His 251.9 fantasy points1 were the ninth-most in a single season by any wide receiver since the merger, and five of the eight seasons ahead of him belong to Jerry Rice or Randy Moss. It was a historic showing, and even more historic when compared to the seasons a smaller wide receiver has ever had. Only one receiver shorter than 6-foot has ever come within 17 points of Brown’s total, and it took an absurd 18 touchdowns for the Dolphins’ Mark Clayton to even get close in 1984. Laundry-listing the Steelers receiver’s season may seem arduous, especially without the consideration of his formidable high-kick. But establishing just how singular Brown’s fantasy contributions were last year is crucial to understanding why some are worried about him — and last year’s other smaller superstars — when it comes to a fantasy replication this season. ??? Nick Wass/AP
The guiding principle when it comes to drafting fantasy receivers mirrors the philosophy inside most NFL front offices: Bigger is better. Given the value of touchdowns, selecting a taller, more reliable red zone target has long been deemed the safe choice. Touchdown totals, so the thinking goes, tend to be all over the place for players who aren’t jump-ball monsters in the end zone. A cursory look at the numbers seems to bear this out. Since the merger, 31 receivers shorter than 6-foot have finished multiple years with 1,000 or more receiving yards, and almost the same number — 34 — has ended at least two seasons with 70 or more catches. Analyzing touchdown totals gets dicier. Only 12 such players have multiple seasons with 10 touchdowns or more, and only a handful of players have done it more than twice. That seems like a small number, but it makes sense when you consider that Steve Smith — a future Hall of Famer2 — had just one season with 10 touchdowns. And that was in 2005 when he won the receiving Triple Crown, leading the league in catches, yards, and scores. Part of the ping-pong-ing comes from the way in which many smaller receivers are used. Smith was always most dangerous as a long-ball threat outside the numbers, and many of the receivers who’ve compiled double-digit scores fall into that category. Terance Mathis averaged nearly 18 yards per reception when he did it for the Falcons in 1998. At 5-11, Joey Galloway wasn’t exactly short on speed — he nabbed 77 touchdowns in 16 seasons. But Brown, Beckham, and Cobb are different — they’re busting up the outside burner-or-benched archetype. Although all three can fly, none of them was relegated to the type of downfield duties reserved for a player like DeSean Jackson. Each hauled in double-digit touchdowns last year, largely because their teams weren’t afraid to feed them the ball when they got to the red zone. The league leader in red zone touchdowns last year wasn’t some behemoth tight end like Rob Gronkowski or Jimmy Graham. (OK, fine, they were tied for second.) Neither managed to beat out Cobb, who hauled in 10 touchdowns inside the 20 for the Packers. Both Brown and Beckham finished tied for seventh with eight. But the contrast among the players who finished in the top 10 is telling. It’s a group of players on different ends of the physical spectrum. Along with Cobb, Brown, and Beckham, the list also includes Gronkowski (9), Julius Thomas (9), Graham (9), Antonio Gates (9), and Dez Bryant (8). At 6-2 and 220 pounds, Bryant is the diminutive one in that second group. Even though these mighty mice managed to equal that predictable group of sasquatches, the pro-tall crowd gets a win when we examine efficiency. With his 33 red zone targets, Brown ranked second among all receivers, and Beckham and Cobb finished tied for third with 25. Some of the smaller star receivers in football were some of the most sought after down near the goal line. Those targets weren’t nearly as fruitful, though, as the ones that went to the big boys. Brown’s eight touchdowns on 33 throws came in just below the league touchdown average of 25 percent, whereas Gronkowski and Bryant blew that number away. It took Gronk only 16 targets to get his nine touchdowns, and for his eight, Bryant needed only 14 passes.3 Excluding the tight ends, it’s still a clear victory for the heightists. Mike Evans had six scores on just 12 targets, Jordan Matthews needed only 15 to get six, and Roddy White got his half-dozen on 14 throws. Otto Greule Jr./Getty Images
Tall players are typically going to make more out of their targets in the red zone,4 and to get the same sort of touchdown totals, shorter receivers are going to need way more opportunities. Both Brown and Beckham got those opportunities last year at a clip unmatched by any other receiver in the league. From Beckham’s first game through the end of the season, he and Brown ranked third and second, respectively, in total targets. Just behind them, with six fewer targets than Beckham, was Julio Jones, who presents a solid counterpoint to the idea that bigger receivers are somehow more reliable. Over that stretch, Jones pulled in just three touchdown catches on his 122 targets, and his red zone efficiency for the entire season — two scores on 11 targets — was actually below the league average. DeAndre Hopkins, another breakout fantasy star from last year, also managed just two touchdowns on 12 targets inside the 20. The point here is that outside of the best red zone targets in football, touchdowns tend to be unpredictable. Even Calvin Johnson had just five during a 2012 season in which he totaled 122 receptions. Replicating fantasy success for smaller receivers tends to be difficult, but that’s in part because replicating fantasy success for any receiver is difficult. With the tumult at running back in recent years, building a fantasy team around wide receivers has been billed as the safer bet — but in league history, the number of pass-catchers who’ve been truly reliable fantasy stars is surprisingly small. Only 97 times since the merger has a receiver finished a season with more than 200 fantasy points, a bar that Brown, Beckham, Cobb, and Sanders all cleared last season. And that list is filled with one-year wonders who never turned into consistent fantasy producers. It’s happened nearly 100 times, but only 17 players have done it more than once. Of the 97 seasons, more than a quarter of them belong to Rice, Terrell Owens, Moss, and Marvin Harrison. The lack of consistency in this regard actually makes what Bryant’s done even more remarkable. Only seven players in league history — including the four players above, plus Calvin Johnson and Sterling Sharpe — own at least three of those 97 seasons, and Bryant is one of them. This lack of reliability is why anyone who’s keeping or looking to overpay for Antonio Brown or Odell Beckham should breathe a little easier. Yes, there’s a good chance neither manages to hit his touchdown total from a season ago, but that’s true for almost any receiver who’s ever played. Outside of Bryant and maybe Megatron, the truly safe bets at wide receiver aren’t easy to find. For smaller receivers, fantasy greatness is always going to be more dependent on workload than it is for a red zone beast. But that’s the nice part about fantasy football — raw totals are all that matters. And given what they showed last season, both the Steelers and Giants are better off throwing to their stars as often as possible. Last year may have been the year of the undersize wide receiver, but in 2015 there’s reason to believe the NFL might be getting small all over again.",2015-08-11T08:57:47+00:00,2015 NFL Preview,Mays
139,Break Out or Get Out: Eight NFL Players Poised to Take a Leap or a Fall in 2015,"This week, our NFL coverage is focusing on franchises that are a small nudge — in one direction or the other — from taking their rightful place in the NFL hierarchy. While Bill Barnwell is homing in on teams and coaches that have reached a tipping point, I decided to build a list of players facing a step up or a drop down in 2015.   John Grieshop/Getty Images Jeremy Hill, RB, Bengals Two years ago, I remember glancing at some of the advanced stats for the Bengals’ running game and being a little confused. Giovani Bernard looked like an exciting young running back, and Cincinnati’s offensive line had as much talent as just about any other group in football. Yet, the 2013 Bengals finished 20th in rushing DVOA. In other words, their running game was somehow less effective than letting Andy Dalton throw the ball. More 2015 NFL PreviewIt's almost here.

Thankfully, Jeremy Hill is here to right the world. The Bengals finished 10th in rushing DVOA last year on the strength of a monster second half by Hill, who was one of the most efficient per-carry backs in the league. With a bigger workload this year, it would be surprising to see the second-year back crack 5 yards per carry again, but his talents remain perfectly suited for an offensive line that just wants to line up and run over teams. Cincinnati doesn’t have the luxury of trotting out Tony Romo at quarterback, but it’s easy to imagine the Bengals trying to replicate the 2014 Dallas offense: a high-quality line, a powerful running back, one specimen of a wide receiver, and plenty of manageable third downs. If that formula works, Hill’s per-carry numbers might drop, but he’ll have a very real chance to win the rushing title. Ryan Tannehill, QB, Dolphins In each of his three seasons, Tannehill’s improved in all the primary areas. Last year, his completion percentage jumped 6 percentage points, and he threw three more touchdowns and five fewer interceptions. On the whole, Tannehill completed 66.4 percent of his passes, posted 27 touchdowns and 12 interceptions, and threw for over 4,000 yards. Despite what look like pretty nice numbers, he still hasn’t been able to throw the ball downfield consistently. Miami finished 30th in QBR on throws that traveled 20 or more yards in the air, and even though the offense was top 10 by DVOA last year, the Dolphins are still missing the ability to gain big chunks of yards. That’s not all on the quarterback, though. And every non-Suh move Miami made this offseason seemed to be part of an effort to fix that problem. Of players with double-digit targets at least 20 yards downfield, no one had a better catch rate (60 percent) than Kenny Stills, who came over in a trade with the Saints. And in case you haven’t seen much of Miami’s first-round pick, DeVante Parker, just know that he will go and get it. It’s also tough to make any deep throws when you don’t have the time. In Weeks 1 through 9 — when star left tackle Branden Albert was still in the lineup — Miami faced pressure at the ninth-lowest rate in football. After Albert tore his ACL, the Dolphins dropped to 27th over the final eight weeks. The offensive line continues to be a question mark, but this group should at least be better than last year. With Albert’s return and a couple of new downfield threats, Tannehill has the skill set and the situation to gain some serious ground on the Elite Quarterback tier. Anthony Barr, OLB, Vikings Vikings fans are really going to hate me and Barnwell by the time the season starts. This team has tons of young, exciting talent, and Barr might be the best of them all. Just two years after moving from offense to defense at UCLA, Barr went through another significant transition as a rookie, moving from the purely pass-rushing role he played in college to linebacker in Mike Zimmer’s defense. Barr had just four sacks in 12 games last year, but expect that number to jump a bit in his second season as he gets a better handle on his responsibilities. And even if Barr’s sack volume never gets too high, his versatility — he plays both as a pass-rusher and a cover linebacker in a way few guys still do — makes him an invaluable building block for Minnesota. It wasn’t totally clear just how he’d fit in Zimmer’s scheme when the Vikings took him ninth overall in 2014, but right now, it looks like he’s well on his way to being a star. Johnathan Hankins, DT, Giants There aren’t many stars left among the Giants defense, but if you had to pick one, it’d be Hankins. Although they finished 24th in defensive DVOA last year, Perry Fewell’s group was able to generate pressure on a higher percentage of opponent dropbacks than every team other than the Eagles. Underrated edge guys like Damontre Moore and a post-hype Robert Ayers help, but their job’s much easier when there’s a massive pocket destroyer wreaking havoc on the inside. Despite playing plenty of nose tackle in 2014, Hankins had seven sacks. He isn’t quite built in the way most other effective pass-rushing defensive tackles are, either. Hankins is listed at 320 pounds, which seems generously low, and his ability to both get after quarterbacks and be a force in the run game reminds me of Haloti Ngata. That may seem like high praise, but consider this: Hankins is already among the better interior linemen in football and by season’s end, he’ll still be only 23. On a defense that’s really searching for foundational pieces, he figures to be one for a long time. Patrick Smith/Getty Images Robert Griffin III, QB, Washington I don’t want to spend too much time on Griffin’s “I feel like I’m the best quarterback” comments, so I’ll just say this: Nah. If we’re envisioning a season in which Griffin at least returns to the ranks of decent NFL quarterbacks, though, it starts in the same place it did for Kyle Shanahan’s offense in 2012: play-action. Since Griffin came into the league, this is the list of quarterbacks with a better QBR on play-action throws: Peyton Manning, Ben Roethlisberger, Russell Wilson, Matt Ryan, Tony Romo, and Philip Rivers. He’s seventh — behind six star quarterbacks and ahead of Andrew Luck, Aaron Rodgers, Tom Brady, and Drew Brees. But on throws without play-action? Well, it’s not great. Griffin’s QBR of 45.0 is 26th among 31 qualifying quarterbacks since 2012. The only ones who’ve been worse? Tannehill, Mark Sanchez, Chad Henne, Brandon Weeden, and Josh Freeman. From the beginning, Griffin’s success was built on the threat of the running game — both with him keeping the ball and Alfred Morris toting it. The scampering quarterback we saw three years ago is probably gone, but for there to be any hope of Griffin inching toward the heights of his rookie year, Washington will need Morris and that offensive line to be better than they were last year. Getting star tackle Trent Williams healthy and bringing in rookie mauler Brandon Scherff at guard should help with that, but if they’re not enough to give Washington the kind of run-friendly environment Griffin will need to succeed, this could really be the end of the quarterback’s time in the nation’s capital. Nick Fairley, DT, Rams Even with a massive, Ndamukong Suh–shaped crater at defensive tackle — one that exists despite the newly signed Haloti Ngata being in town — Detroit still elected to let Fairley walk. Before a midseason knee injury, Fairley was playing some of the best football of his career in 2014. The sack numbers weren’t impressive, but with him and Suh shoving guards back into opposing quarterbacks, the Lions built the best defense in football over the first half of the season. Detroit fell off a bit in the second half, and while that had to do with more than just Fairley’s knock, missing its second star tackle certainly didn’t help. Come the offseason, Fairley’s free-agency value on the open market was one of the more intriguing story lines. Yet, when he signed a one-year deal with St. Louis for $5 million,1 it was a clear indication that most teams were hesitant to give him a long-term deal in the price range he wanted. At this point, it looks like it’s going to take a full year of Fairley producing at a high level for a team to trust him with a big deal. In St. Louis, he’ll see his share of single-teams with Aaron Donald next to him and Robert Quinn and Chris Long on the outside, but there’s also a chance that the depth across the Rams’ line limits his number of snaps. However much he ends up playing, if Fairley can both look motivated and stay healthy for an entire season, the 27-year-old should get one more significant multiyear contract in 2016. Dre Kirkpatrick, CB, Bengals One of the rare defensive picks from that 2012 draft who hasn’t turned into a star, Kirkpatrick finally started to make his way into the Bengals lineup late last season while Terence Newman struggled with injuries and a dip in play. Cincinnati has enjoyed one of the better pass defenses in football in recent years, and part of that is because of the depth of quality at cornerback. With Adam Jones, Leon Hall, and Newman holding down the starting spots, Kirkpatrick’s struggled to break through, and this year provides what might be his last chance to do so. Newman is off to join former coordinator Mike Zimmer in Minnesota, but last year’s first-round pick, Darqueze Dennard, is lurking, hoping to avoid the spot on the bench that Kirkpatrick occupied during his first few seasons. If Kirkpatrick can’t get a firm grasp on a starting job this season, it’s unlikely he ever will. Sam Bradford, QB, Eagles I’d like to hop in a time machine to go back and see Bradford’s reaction when he learned he was traded to Philadelphia. Few players in the entire league needed a change of scenery more than him, but going from the uninventive Brian Schottenheimer to the mad genius of Chip Kelly is like going from a unicycle to a smart car. That the Eagles figured him worth acquiring is already a good sign for Bradford’s future. You can see Kelly’s thought process here, too: When he starred at Oklahoma, Bradford was the point man for the fastest offense in college football, and that’s what he’ll be operating under Kelly. He’s at his best when he’s making quick throws to the middle of the field, and he’ll have plenty of those chances in this offense. It’s no coincidence that the Eagles’ nominal no. 1 receiver, Jordan Matthews, plays in the slot. Bradford will also be aided by the kind of effective running game he never had in St. Louis. In his four seasons as a starter, the Rams’ best finish in rushing DVOA was 19th, and in three of those years, they finished in the bottom five. The Eagles finished 13th last season after running away with the top spot in 2013. Even with the departure of Evan Mathis, some better offensive line health, coupled with the arrival of DeMarco Murray and Ryan Mathews, should bring the Eagles back near where they were in 2013. With the run game and the construction of their receiving corps, this is an offense perfectly suited for Bradford’s talents. He’ll have every chance to succeed with Kelly, and if he doesn’t, I’m not sure there’s a scenario in which he can.",2015-08-19T12:36:27+00:00,2015 NFL Preview,Mays
140,"‘Hard Knocks: Houston Texans’: The Sadness of Cut Day, the Joy of Vince Wilfork in Overalls and Cowboy Boots","The Houston Texans are the subject of this season’s Hard Knocks, HBO’s wonderful mini-documentary series that follows a professional football team for the weeks leading up to the start of the season. Disclosure: The Houston Texans are going to win the Super Bowl this year. Another disclosure: They’re going undefeated, too. Final disclosure: I root for the Texans. Some things that happened last night in Episode 4: It’s no longer a competition, or if it is, then it’s a competition the way the Seahawks-Broncos Super Bowl was a competition, or the way John Wick vs. Those Guys in the Nightclub was a competition. O’Brien put on a world-class FUCK exhibition in Episode 4, delivering 15.51 variations2 of FUCK to just one from Vrabel. O’Brien was Jordan putting up six 3-pointers in the first half of Game 1 of the ’92 Finals. He was the Predator in the first half of Predator. Coach Vrabel, he stood tall. He was brave and he was fearless and he was determined. He stood on that log and cut a line across his chest in a declaration of war just like Billy did. And he got mowed down just like Billy did, too. O’Brien: 52.5 Vrabel: 26 During a segment about linebacker Kourtnei Brown, the narrator made mention of Brown having been cut by five NFL teams since 2012, with the voice-over saying the phrase “his dreams seemingly just beyond his reach” as they showed a slow-motion shot of Brown diving to tackle a running back, missing him by inches. It was a way better moment than the tricky lead-in they did last week to Brian Cushing vomiting all over the field. HBO HBO I don’t even know. How do you even? What farm is he tending to? I bet it’s got the biggest fucking vegetables and livestock. I super can’t wait for Green Mile 2: Coffey’s Revenge. HBO 1. J.J. Watt shouting, “They can take as many tries as they need, they’re not getting in,” after his defense stopped the offense from scoring from the 2-yard line on four straight attempts. And then after that, digging the knife in further, dismissively asking, “You sure you don’t want some more work on that?” J.J. Watt talking shit will always be captivating. 1a. J.J. Watt eating 600 pounds of barbecue. He went with Vince Wilfork (and another guy who I couldn’t immediately recognize) to Killen’s Barbecue, a place that regularly requires you to wait upward of two hours to be fed, though I suspect Watt and Wilfork (and the other guy) were served much quicker than that. Right before we’re shown Watt and Wilfork at the restaurant, we see them walking around at practice talking about eating barbecue. After they decide to do so, Watt asks Wilfork, “What kind of meat are you getting?” Wilfork, ever the hero, pauses for a bit, then responds, “All of it.” Watt and Wilfork are the best interracial buddy-cop movie that I have ever seen. 1b. J.J. Watt laughing at something Vince Wilfork said. These two are great together. 1c. J.J. Watt talking about having lost his fifth-grade spelling bee. 1d. J.J. Watt breaking down a huddle. 1e. J.J. Watt standing as part of a huddle. 1f. J.J. Watt wiping sweat off his face. 1g. J.J. Watt making a funny face while trying to catch a football. 1h. J.J. Watt drinking a protein shake, then talking about treating his body like how Olympic athletes treat theirs. (This was before he and Wilfork attempted to eat an entire elephant.) 1i. J.J. Watt holding a towel around his neck while giving advice. HBO He’s great. He’s become a legit underdog hero in Houston. When the Texans put him at running back at the end of this past preseason game against the Saints and he broke a 70-plus-yard touchdown run3 the first time he was shown touching the ball, I got at least as many messages about it as I do whenever J.J. Watt does something incredible. He’s going to make the team. He has to. HE HAS TO. Every time they show him, he’s doing something good. It’d be just a totally crushing move if the Hard Knocks people dedicated all this camera time to him, all of this energy to making us all fall in love with him, only for us to see him get his throat slit in the last episode. He has to make the team. HE HAS TO.  With the exception of Charles James II, no player has presented himself as more positive, more likable, more root-for-him-worthy than Uzoma Nwachukwu. In Episode 3, he was the one who oozed charm during an off-day trip to Space Center Houston. In Episode 4, he did the exact same thing, except this time during a fishing trip with fellow wide receiver Travis Labhart. I desperately want for him to make the team. But it feels a lot like he’s going to end up a casualty of numbers — there are 12 receivers trying out for, at most, six available spots. Best-case scenario: Charles James II makes the team and Uzoma makes the team, too. Middle-case scenario: Charles James II makes the team and Uzoma does not make the team and I cry a lot. Worst-case scenario: Neither Charles James II nor Uzoma make the team and I hang myself. Whether Charles James II and Uzoma Nwachukwu make the team is the only plot point I’m concerned with for next week’s final episode, truly. HBO Shortly after Brian Hoyer was named starting quarterback, Ryan Mallett, the person he beat out for the job, missed practice. Mallett blamed missing practice on his phone’s alarm, but that’s (probably) not what actually happened. I’ll tell you what (probably) actually happened. This will be Mallett’s second season in Houston. He’s been here long enough now that he’s become infected with supreme pettiness, which saturates the Houston atmosphere and is a thing that eventually soaks its way into every Houstonian. The only people who were upset that Mallett missed that practice were people who don’t live in Houston and sports-talk radio people, who, as far as I can tell, have jobs where they pretend to be very mad at stuff like that. Nobody in Houston cared. In fact, we all decided we liked him more for doing that. I am a big, big fan of supreme pettiness. One time — this was, like, eight months after I’d moved to Houston — my wife asked me to take her to some fancy restaurant I didn’t want to take her to. I said no. She said it didn’t matter, that I was taking her anyway, and to go get dressed. And so I did. I put on a muscle shirt, a pair of basketball shorts, a fake fur coat, and dress shoes. I understand that that sounds like a lie or an embellishment, but it is 100 percent not. I came out of the room like, “OK, I’m ready to go.” She just looked at me, and she was like, “That’s what you’re wearing?” And I was like, “Yep.” And she said, “Let’s go then.” I’d been in Houston long enough that the pettiness had found its way into me, so that’s why I dressed up like that. But she was born there and had been there for 20 years already before I even met her. She trumped my pettiness with TRUE PETTINESS. She made me sit in that restaurant in those stupid clothes and it didn’t faze her even a tiny amount. The longer you’re here, the more developed your pettiness becomes. Shout-out to you, Ryan Mallett. I hope that after Hoyer messes up a few times and they decide to put you in the game that you for real throw an interception on purpose. You deserve that. You’ve earned that. HBO Episode 4 was the first of two Cut Day episodes, wherein the Texans trim their roster from the original 90-plus players down to 53. The last few minutes showed Coach O’Brien in meeting after meeting, explaining to player after player why he wasn’t going to make the team. The last person brought in, wide receiver Travis Labhart, listened to O’Brien talk, mentioned that he had considered giving up playing football and possibly transitioning into a coaching role, then stood up, shook O’Brien’s hand, and walked out. The cuts themselves are bad enough; watching these guys — most of whom are still in their twenties — be told that they don’t have a job anymore is hard enough. But with Labhart, when he was walking out, when he was walking down the hallway in slow motion, the narrator verbalized the philosophical drama that appeared to be playing out in Labhart’s head. “Imagine your lifelong dream ending,” he said as Labhart walked, staring forward at nothing except heartbreak. “Where do you go?” “Who do you tell?” “How do you begin again?” HBO",2015-09-02T12:35:04+00:00,TV,Serrano
141,When Did Will Smith Stop Being Cool?,"Will Smith released new music last week. It was the first time it’s happened in a decade, so it should have been a big thing and caused a ruckus. But it wasn’t. And it didn’t. In fact, of all the newsy bits that came out in his interview with Beats 1’s Zane Lowe (new music, a potential world tour, the likelihood of Bad Boys 3), the thing most everyone latched onto wasn’t even about him, it was about how Jared Leto is kind of a weirdo. This is the first set of entries that come up currently if you search “Will Smith” in Google News:  It’s sad. But it’s understandable. Because while it is essentially still impossible not to like Will Smith (he is SO good at being likable), it’s become easy to ignore him. And that’s VERY bizarre to think about, especially if you grew up during his arrival to stardom. I mean, there was a time when he was among the six coolest people on the planet,1 likely sometime between the third and fourth seasons of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, when he transcended the perceived limitations of the show. And there was definitely a period when he managed to shake free from the “harmless good guy” tag and become truly riveting (1995-97, when he starred in Bad Boys, Independence Day, and Men in Black). But that’s gone. It’s gone. And so all I want to know is: When did Will Smith stop being cool? I think an easy answer, or the most immediate answer, would be to say it happened when “Gettin’ Jiggy Wit It” came out. That was the third single from his debut solo album, 1997’s Big Willie Style. The first single was “Men in Black,” the highlight of the Men in Black rollout. It possessed a clear intent (OK, this is the moment when I officially transition from a star whom people associate with music to a star whom people associate with movies), and that should’ve drowned it in insincerity. But he was so charming and undeniable and had built up so much goodwill that it worked.2 After that came the forgettable (but not terrible) “Just Cruisin’.” And then, boom, “Gettin’ Jiggy Wit It,” a song people were tricked into liking instantly, which they greatly regretted shortly thereafter. He rapped about his cardio, about holding cigars (but not smoking cigars), and then dressed like a pharaoh in the video:  And also dressed like a rain forest in the video:  So when it was over, when that initial HEY HEY HEY NEW WILL SMITH STUFF feeling was gone, after he’d somehow sneaked off with a Grammy for it, that was the first time we got to Uncool Will. But it can’t all be tied to that moment. It can start there, but it can’t end there. Eight months later, he released the “Just the Two of Us” single, the one about being a father and leaning all the way into being in love with his son, and it was just beautiful and great and top-tier, and so of course he was cool after “Gettin’ Jiggy Wit’ It.” You know what was worse than “Gettin’ Jiggy Wit’ It”? 1999’s “Freakin’ It.” That was the first time we saw Upset Will Smith, or Confrontational Will Smith. I linked to it, but don’t click on it because it’s bad. Just know that in it, he: He did that song in 1999. He’d already done Wild Wild West, and the only good thing that came from that was Sisqo wearing a cowboy outfit made of cowskin.  He put out music after that (albums in 2002 and 2005), but they were largely invisible and, worse still, inconsequential. For his movies, he’s had a couple of cool moments since 1999. He was Historically Cool as Muhammad Ali in Ali (2001). And he was Obviously Cool as Mike Lowry in 2003’s Bad Boys 2 (though Martin Lawrence was clearly the more enjoyable and entertaining character). He was Animated Cool in Shark Tale (2004), and he was Dedicated Dad Cool in Pursuit of Happyness (2006), and he was Brooding and Desperate Cool in I Am Legend (2007), a movie that I will champion forever despite the backlash that almost always follows. That’s it, though. The Legend of Bagger Vance (2000) was I don’t even know. I, Robot was a fun movie to watch, but his role there (Del Spooner, a homicide detective with a secret he’s ashamed of) was his first foray into being Dark and Mysterious Will Smith, and he was good in it, but he wasn’t cool in it the way, say, Tom Hardy is in those sorts of roles. Hitch was 2005 and that was the first time he was in a movie that seemed to exist only to remind you that Will Smith was someone you should consider cool. Hancock was 2008 and you could go either way there (despite its goofiness, I liked it). Seven Pounds was also 2008, and I still haven’t forgiven him for that one. He jumped back to the Men in Black franchise in 2012 with MIB3, and it was good enough. After Earth was 2013 (FOH). And then Focus was earlier this year, and it wasn’t as bad as it looked like it was going to be, but it also felt a lot like we were being force-fed the idea that Will Smith was hip, which just isn’t the case anymore. The very first sentence of this article is “Will Smith released new music last week,” and I feel confident that nobody who read that was like, “Well, where is it? Because I need to hear it right now.” I’m sad about that. Here’s the song. Just listen to it:  It was smart of him to inch back into music by adding a verse to an already successful song, but it’s also telling about his trepidation. Here’s Will explaining how he ended up on the song, which is more interesting than the song itself because Will Smith is very good at talking to cameras:  There wasn’t a single moment or event that switched Will Smith from being Cool to Not Cool; it happened slowly, imperceptibly, starting around 1999 and then fully actualizing itself after Seven Pounds in 2008. Let me be clear when I say that Will Smith isn’t Uncool, because Uncool is way different (and way worse) than just being Not Cool. Will Smith will never be Uncool. He has all but assured himself of that. But I don’t know if he’ll ever be cool again. I hope so. God, I hope so.",2015-10-07T15:37:15+00:00,Movies,Serrano
142,Which Movie Astronauts Would You Want to Be Stranded With in Outer Space?,"Matt Damon’s The Martian opens wide today. And a very lazy but still accurate (and spoiler-less) summation of the movie is that it’s about “an astronaut who gets stranded on Mars for a long time and does some stuff and hopes he gets rescued.” So here’s the question: Which movie astronauts would you want to be with in outer space? And which ones would you definitely not want to be with in outer space? This doesn’t necessarily presume that you and your astronaut friend will definitely face a life-or-death situation, but it does consider how that astronaut would navigate any life-or-death situation that might arise. Other things involved: How would he or she handle the mental punishment that being in space inflicts upon the brain? How would he or she deal with the possibility of having to spend the rest of his or her life in space? How would he or she react should aliens turn out to be real? And so on. Normally, these sorts of conversations require rules to function efficiently, but really there’s only one that needs to be instituted here. It’s easy: We need to get rid of the astronauts from movies in which people live in space full time (or mostly full time), because those characters are already comfortable with the unnaturalness of Being In Space. So let’s consider only those who have traveled to space or been placed into space in a temporary context. So, do I want to be in outer space with these astronauts? Let’s figure it out.  She was smart. She was driven. She was capable. She was invested and dedicated. And she was brave but not fearless, which is an essential trait. I trust Dr. Eleanor Arroway. I trust her to keep us safe during our mission; and when we inevitably find ourselves in a harrowing and deadly situation, I trust her to figure out how to get us out of there alive. I will concede that my trust in Dr. Arroway is, at least in part, a byproduct of my trust in Jodie Foster. She has outsmarted far too many things in movies for me to question her abilities. She outsmarted Hannibal Lecter in The Silence of the Lambs, a war criminal in Inside Man, a group of hijackers in Flightplan, colonialism in Anna and the King, a genius in Little Man Tate, and, probably least impressively, Jared Leto in Panic Room. Love you, Jodie. Respect you, Jodie. Do I Want to Be in Outer Space With This Astronaut? Yes.  Someone builds a ship that creates black holes, allowing it to travel theretofore unimaginable distances across the universe. The ship goes into one of the holes. It comes back seven years later. Everyone inside the ship is dead. And the crew that boards the ship to investigate gets tortured to death. Because, surprise, the ship is now a portal to hell. And Dr. William Weir is now its Demon Captain. And he’s naked. And he’s real good at kicking you. I don’t want any of part of this. Do I Want to Be in Outer Space With This Astronaut? Fuck no.  But largely because I never got to meet one of my grandfathers and the other one died before I could form any real memories with him. That’s why. (This got heavy on you real quick, huh?) Do I Want to Be in Outer Space With These Astronauts? Yes.  You know what makes (nearly) every situation better? Chimps. Imagine the worst thing that could happen in space happening to you. Now swap out all of the people in that situation with chimps. Do you even know how funny the end of Armageddon would’ve been if it were chimps instead of Harry and A.J.? OH MY GOD A CHIMP NAMED HARRY. Do I Want to Be in Outer Space With These Astronauts? God, yes.  He’s in a three-way tie for Last-Place Astronaut with the Leprechaun in Leprechaun 4: In Space and Johnny Depp’s Spencer Armacost in The Astronaut’s Wife. Do I Want to Be in Outer Space With This Astronaut? FOH.  You’re not smart enough to figure out that there’s something very suspicious about the mission they’re sending you on? Then I’m not trying to be part of your crew. (I had to go back-to-back-to-back with space chimps, space killers, and space aliens to balance out the grandpa thing.) Do I Want to Be in Outer Space With These Astronauts? Nah.  Dr. Kelvin seems like an OK guy. He’s moral and he’s measured and he’s smart (and he’s definitely handsome, which, whether you admit it or not, is always something you silently consider when you’re deciding who you want to hang out with). But he’s still very much broken up about the suicide of his wife, as well he should be, because that’s just an awful, awful thing. And that’s just too much baggage in his rearview mirror for me to be comfortable with him in outer space, you know what I’m saying? When a man loses the woman he loves, he’s just too much of a liability. The best-case scenario is that he parlays it into a contained rage, which, under the right circumstances, can at least be indirectly beneficial to other people. An easy example is Montgomery Wick in Vertical Limit. His wife died on a climbing expedition, and he gets coaxed into leading a no-chance rescue mission of a different group years later. He’d refused to go on it initially, telling them they’d all die, but then they told him that the person he thinks is responsible for her death is one of the people they’ll be rescuing, and so he agrees to go because it finally gives him a chance to confront the person. Another good example is Maximus in Gladiator. And another good one is John Wick in John Wick. And another good one is William Wallace in Braveheart. Guys like that. More often than not, though, the loss is just too much to overcome, and it ends up corroding the guy’s everything, making him uneven and unreliable once the memory of his dead wife is dredged up. So now you’re talking about guys like Joe in Looper, Teddy in Shutter Island, Leonard in Memento. This, unfortunately, is where our Dr. Kelvin ends up — a gorgeous home built on wet sand. Do I Want to Be in Outer Space With This Astronaut? Nope.  Same as above. Lost his wife. I don’t trust him. I don’t want to be in space with him. HOWEVER, he’s a top-two pick for me if the conversation becomes Which Astronaut Do You Want to Send to Outer Space on a Nearly Impossible Mission to Try to Save Humankind? His willingness for self-sacrifice for the betterment of others becomes highly valuable to me in that situation. I just don’t want to be sitting next to him when he decides the only way to prevent Earth’s destruction is to crash his space shuttle head-first into the comet headed toward New York City. Do I Want to Be in Outer Space With This Astronaut? No, thank you.  Stamper has also lost the woman he loved,1 and he’s also possessed of the type of uncommon valor that Interstellar’s Cooper has. The main difference, though, is that Stamper is going to find a way to save everyone by killing himself and ONLY himself. I joked once before about how I’d have been able to blow up an asteroid with a nuclear bomb while I stood on it because I want that type of hero’s death, but I was speaking in jest because I know that I’ll never be in that situation. Were I actually in his spot, then I’m riding that asteroid all the way TF into Washington, D.C., (or wherever it was going to hit). More than that, I’m making sure everyone else who went into space with me dies too. (Stamper is obviously the first-place pick in the Which Astronaut Do You Want to Send to Outer Space on a Nearly Impossible Mission to Try to Save Humankind? thing mentioned above.) Do I Want to Be in Outer Space With This Astronaut? For sure.  How many different times did he save Sandy Bullock’s life? Three? Four? Five? Six? And then when he needed her to save his life, when he was tumbling away from that ship and he told her, “Gimme five,” meaning, “Grab my hand so I don’t float off into oblivion,” what’d she do? I’ll tell you what she didn’t do. She didn’t give him five, that’s for sure. She missed him. She whiffed. He floated by, she grabbed a cord dangling off behind him to try and stop him, but by then it was too late; his momentum was carrying him and her with too much force. So he detached himself, essentially killing himself to save her life again.2 And then later on in the movie, when she’s trapped and can’t figure out how to work that last ship to fly it back to Earth, HE LITERALLY CAME BACK FROM THE DEAD TO TELL HER HOW TO DO IT. I’m here for Matt Kowalski. Matt Kowalski is my guy. Matt Kowalski has all my faith. Do I Want to Be in Outer Space With This Astronaut? Yes. 100 percent yes.",2015-10-02T13:42:56+00:00,Movies,Serrano
143,The 10 Old De Niros You Personally Confront on the Way to Heaven,"Not very long ago, my wife and I were sitting in the front room pretending to watch TV but mostly just enjoying the silence. One of my sons, 8, walked into the room. He had been with his twin brother in the room they share at the back of the house, probably playing with Legos but possibly sitting in their closets playing Nintendo 3DS with the volume off because they are slippery little weasels. He stood there for a beat, then said, “Daddy.” I could tell from the way he said it that he was going to ask me a question, but I could also tell that the question was one I’d be able to answer without getting up off the couch, so I was responded in a pleasant tone. He said, “How old are you?” I said, “What?” He said, “How old are you? I don’t know how old you are.” I said, “How old do you think I am?” He thought on it, then said, “I don’t know. 15?” I said, “15?” He said, “Yes, sir.” I said, “You’re 8, right?” He said, “Yes, sir.” I said, “So you think you were born when I was 7?” He was quiet for a second. Then he said, “62?” I said, “You’re very bad at this. I’m 34.” He said, “Oh,” and then he turned to walk away and I was happy that I’d been able to spend such quality time with at least one of my children. He took maybe three steps, stopped, turned back around, then said, “Daddy.” I was less pleasant this time. He said, “… Is that old?” I didn’t know what to say back. I don’t know if that’s old. Sometimes it feels old, like in situations when I have to stand up very quickly, but sometimes it doesn’t (like in situations when I can stand up at a regular speed). I said, “I’m not sure. I guess it depends on who I’m talking to you. Right now I’m old because I’m talking you. But tomorrow morning I’ll be young when I talk to grandma on the phone. I don’t know, man. Age is weird. Or it’s a weird construct. Or maybe I mean to say ‘young’ and ‘old’ are weird terms. There are a lot of factors involved. Or maybe there aren’t. Maybe it’s pretty straightforward.” And then he said, “Daddy.” And I said, “Yeah?” And he said, “Can I go play Legos now?” And I said, “I can’t stand you.” I saw The Intern when it came out on Friday. That’s why I’ve been remembering that conversation. Robert De Niro, who plays Ben, a retired businessman who takes on an intern position at an e-company because he’s lonely and listless, is obviously the best part of it. He’s fun and nuanced and steady. And he’s old. Obviously old. Outwardly, it’s the central part of his existence in the movie. In real life, today, Bobby De Niro is 72. In the movie, his character is 70. I didn’t know that.1 Robert De Niro has been old in movies for longer than I’d realized, and he’s been more types of “old” than I’d realized, too. Think about it like this: He’s been old in movies since, say, at least 2000, right? That’s the year he was in Meet the Parents, playing Ben Stiller’s father-in-law. But he was also in that Adventures of Rocky & Bullwinkle movie and he had a scene in it where he re-created his “Are you talking to me?” bit from Taxi Driver. Poking fun at a movie you were in more than two decades ago seems like a good point to be like, “Oh, you’re old now.”   So that’s a good 15 years of being old. I want to be old like how Robert De Niro’s been old, or at least something close to one of his versions of agedness. These are the 10 best versions of Old De Niro.  There’s a part in The Intern when Anne Hathaway’s character is experiencing a crisis of sorts and she’s all busted up over it and she says something and Ben says something back and then she pauses, focuses her mega-eyes on him, then says something close to, “How do you always know just the right thing to say?” That’s the kind of old I wanna be. I’m not that. I’m OK at knowing the correct thing to write, but that’s usually because I get to think about it for five, six, or 10 hours while I work on it. I’m way worse at it in actual life. In actual life, I end up saying something that’s supposed to be a joke when I’m supposed to be serious, or something serious when I’m supposed to be joking. One time, my wife very seriously asked me what sort of plan I had for handling a semi-concerning family issue. What I should’ve done was matched her sincerity in my response, or at least just given her an exasperated “I don’t know” head shake. That’s not what I did, though. What I did was to say, “I know exactly what I’m going to do,” and she said, “What?” and I said, “This,” and then I stood up and farted. :(  I’m so terrified that I’m going to be Dumb Old. I don’t want to be Dumb Old. I want to be Smart and Slick Old. I want to be able to outsmart Edward Norton should I need to. And I’m not talking about Death to Smoochy Ed Norton, either. Death to Smoochy Ed Norton was about as smart as a box of hats.2 I want to get the upper hand on Fight Club Ed Norton. Or The Illusionist Ed Norton. Even Primal Fear Ed Norton.  I don’t think enough people talk about how good of a dad Don Lino was. He built up an empire, set it all up for his children to take over, had one of his sons die in a freak anchor accident, thought his other son had died, too, set in place a plan to bring to justice the guy he thought had murdered them both, found out that his other son was actually alive and wandering around the ocean pretending to be a dolphin, then just took him back like, “It’s cool, dude. I love you. I love you for who you are.” That’s dope, man. Settling into Very Invested Father Old would make for a gorgeous existence.  YES. This is my dream version of being old. I desperately want to be Hyperbolically Tough Old De Niro. I won’t end up there, though. I always think I’m tough, but then something will happen, like I’ll get a splinter or a piece of glass stuck in my foot and then be like, “Well, I guess I have to cut my foot off now because there’s no way I can live with this pain.” Love Hyperbolically Tough Old. Covet it. Want it. Need it. Zero percent chance I get it.  There’s a direct correlation between how old I’m getting versus how much stuff I openly admit to hating or disliking. I love hating things right now. LOVE IT. It makes me feel so good to just be like, “Mmmph, I HATE that guy.” It’s very likely that, out of all of the types of Old De Niros listed here, I’m most likely going to end up in this category.  There are people who will say that he was better as Straight-Faced, Funny Old De Niro in Analyze This and Analyze That. I never want to be one of those people.  I want to write a bunch about why his role as Tom Cowan lands him here, but I don’t know how without spoiling the ending for you, and I don’t want to spoil the ending for you because while Righteous Kill certainly isn’t a good movie, it’s a fun and enjoyable one.  LaMarca is a sandpaper-rough city cop with a sordid past. His son was a junkie accused of killing a cop and LaMarca hated him, basically. But he gave up his badge to protect him. That’s the sort of limitless protective instinct that comes with age (or is forced by age, in certain situations). I’m protective of my sons, as most dads are, but I’m not trying to throw my life away to protect one of them yet. I mean, my baby, I’ve known him for only two years, you know what I’m saying? That’s not that long. If police show up at my house tomorrow like, “Sir, your baby is accused of killing a person, he’s going to prison for a long time,” then he’s just going to prison for a long time. I think a good rule of thumb here is if the person stands to go to prison for longer than the time you’ve known him or her, then you turn them over to the authorities. If you’ve known them longer than the potential prison sentence, then you’re obligated to try to protect them. So for the twins, I’ve known them eight years, so if we’re talking about crimes with mandatory minimum sentences, that makes me responsible to them up to things like burglary (five years) or first-degree assault (five years) or committing a class A, B, or C felony with a rifle (eight years). The baby’s eligible for operating a motor vehicle without a license (90 days). If the police show up for that, I’m good. I’m down. I’ll burn the city to the ground to protect him. Other than that, he’s on his own.  When I was in the sixth or seventh grade, I got a real bad flu and missed four or five days of school right before Christmas break. My grandma said it was because someone had given me ojo, which is kind of a very low-level curse that Mexicans believe in. I think it was actually because I had been jumping on the trampoline in the rain in my underwear for an hour before she’d gotten home from work the day prior. There was this whole routine with an egg and a chant (and rest and medicine) and all this and then a few days later I was fine and she was like, “It worked,” and everyone else was like, “Great job,” and I was like, “Maybe it was because I took some Theraflu and laid down for a week,” and she was like, “Nope. It was the egg I put under your bed.” I can’t wait to be Superstitious Old. Superstitious Old might be my favorite kind of old.  Carl Van Loon is the most obvious example (he wanted endless wealth and power) of Aspirational Old. Another good example, though, is Senator McLaughlin, De Niro’s character in Machete (he wanted to hold public office, and also to send all the Mexicans back to Mexico, a political stance with which I am not in agreement). This feels like the level of old you hit before you actually become old. Maybe you thought you were still young but then something tied to being old happened, like you had a heart attack, or all of a sudden you started to hate rap music and you went, “Oh. I’m getting old. I need to get some stuff done before I get up outta here.” I’m very excited to be this version of old. I’m very excited at the prospect of being truly motivated.",2015-09-29T15:53:17+00:00,Movies,Serrano
144,"Songs of the Week: Young Jeezy, Leon Bridges, and the Significance of Scarface"," The best song of the summer, truly. There are probably some questions you have. Questions like, Who is this guy? and, Why did he make this song? and, Why is there a toilet in his backyard? and on and on. But the answers don’t matter. They rarely ever do with ultra-geniuses. I mean, I can tell you what he said when he was asked to answer them (he’s just a guy; he made it because he was listening to Pandora one night and Next’s “Too Close” came on and he thought it’d be funny to change the words; he was remodeling his bathroom and put a new toilet in and set the old one in the backyard and forgot about it), and you might think you understand his answers or that you “get” them. But you don’t actually. Just like I don’t actually. Because Nicholas Fraser, same as Albert Einstein and Prince before him, does not live on the same planet that you and I do. He says our words, our English words in the English language that we know and are familiar with, but they don’t have our meanings. It’s selfish of you to assume they would. Why are you assuming? Why are you always assuming? Mmmmmmmmohmygod, stop assuming.  This is from Clark’s new album, The Story of Sonny Boy Slim. It’s very good, although you were probably able to guess that because he’s Gary Clark Jr. I am so excited about giving him my money and also my virginity, too, if he’ll allow it.  Cousin Stizz is a rapper from Boston. If you know him, it’s because (a) he is your actual cousin, or (b) you saw a short video of Drake dancing to one of his songs posted to Instagram last year. “No Explanation” is from his very lush, very incredible tape Suffolk County, which came out earlier this summer and is a thing I am all the way in love with. I listen to County in full, no joke, at least three times a day. There isn’t a single song on it that’s bad; there are only songs that are even greater than other great songs. When he raps, his words just sort of crawl over his barely opened teeth, generally only half-pronounced and rarely ever concerned enough to do anything more than fade into the atmosphere. I love it. Listening to him when he’s all the way in his mode, like he is here on “No Explanation,” feels like you’re sitting at a table in outer space, except that table ain’t a table, it’s actually a cloud made of goop. If that doesn’t make sense then it’s only because you haven’t listened to “No Explanation” while you’re sitting in the dark alone late at night. Cousin Stizz’s whole entire everything feels effortless, and I can’t think of a more impressive thing than making something so textured and gradient seem effortless.  When I was a kid, it used to make me crazy when my parents would listen to norteño music.1 I thought it was too crowded and too bombastic and too goofy, all those men on stage dressed in the same outfit playing accordions and blowing into bottles or whatever. No way, I said. Not a chance, I said. Not me, I said. NEVER me, I said. It’s music for aged Mexican men and women, I argued. And I guess I was at least 20 percent right, because now that I am an aged Mexican it has snuck its way into my playlists. I don’t think I’ve gone more than 20 hours since I turned 30 without saying something close to, “You know what would be great right now? La Tropa F.” I feel it in my body when it comes on now, when it’s playing at whatever taqueria I happen to be standing in at lunchtime or whatever carnicería I happen to have to go to to pick up something for dinner. I hear it playing and I feel my white blood cells and my red blood cells turning into brown blood cells and they’re all wearing cowboy hats and trying to figure out who has the most staid mustache. When I drive somewhere with my sons, I almost always listen to it. And I can hear them in the backseat, snickering or sighing or sometimes both if they’re feeling especially contentious. “Can we listen to something else, Daddy,” one of them will say. And it makes me smile. I can’t wait to sit in the backyard with them in 22 years and listen to them try to explain how they’ve inexplicably started listening to old Tierra Cali albums.  This one song is better than anything on Rick Ross’s new mixtape, Black Dollar, and I couldn’t be happier about it because Rick Ross stole Young Jeezy’s career right out from under his feet in 2006.  Just gorgeous. Still gorgeous. Will always be gorgeous. There’s this new tape going around right now where some people took songs from Bridges’s Coming Home album and mushed them together with old Houston rap songs. That’s a fun idea, I’m happy that people took the time do that. You can download it here. The best one on there is the re-do of “Shine,” which got fused to the skeleton of UGK’s “One Day,” although maybe that’s not so surprising because everything is better when you add UGK’s “One Day” to it. Leon Bridges is dope. I’m super into his whole-cut late-‘50s persona. I hope he’s being for real. I hope he for real feels compelled to do that, to be that, to make that sound. Leon Bridges is dope.  In 2008, I watched my grandmother get eaten alive by cancer. It took six months, the whole thing; six months for one of the two strongest women I’d ever known to wither away into a whisper, into a wheeze, into a gasp, into a memory. For those last few weeks, she carried this cup around wherever she went. Whenever I sit still long enough to be forced to reckon with her passing, I always think about that cup. It was for the vomit. Because in those last couple of weeks, the only thing she had enough energy to do was vomit. She couldn’t eat. She couldn’t drink. She couldn’t sleep. She couldn’t do anything. Except vomit. I hated that cup. I hated that cup so fucking much. Sometimes, when I think about her, when I think about that particular time, I think about Scarface. Not all the time, mind you. Not even “a lot” of the time. Just “some” of the time. He doesn’t have any specific relationship to the story, but he does have a tangential relationship to it. Several months after the funeral, I found myself in the waiting room of a urologist. I’d known that I’d had a small lump on each of my testicles since high school, but I’d mostly done a very good job of ignoring them entirely. After seeing the way her body cannibalized itself, though, I felt an unignorable urge to get them checked, if not for myself, then for my wife and my then-2-year-old twin sons. I don’t want to talk a lot about what I was thinking at the time or what I was feeling, but just know that very little of it was good or helpful. I was angry a lot. I was mean to strangers and I was meaner to people who knew me and I was meanest to the people who loved me. I actively sought out confrontations with people, and I suppose I still do that now, but it’s different, or at least it feels different, which is close enough. Man, I don’t know. Maybe I’m still not over it. I feel like I am, but maybe I’m not. Maybe I’m still mad that she died the way she died. I had a dream about a year ago that she was still alive. It felt so real. I walked into my living room and she was sitting on the couch just looking at me how she used to look at me and I felt the world drop out from under my feet. I cried so hard in the dream that I woke myself up. I wasn’t crying in real life, though. I haven’t cried once since she died. I’ve tried to allow myself to, but nothing happens. That’s a true thing. It might be a weird thing but it’s definitely a true thing. But back to Scarface: He’s who I was listening to when I was in that urologist’s office. His music had just shuffled on by accident when I was on my way there, and so I just clicked over to the album and let it play for the duration of the visit. I had one earbud in and one earbud out. I remember sitting there with the doctor and explaining the situation and I never took that one earbud out. He never asked me to, either. I don’t imagine I would have if he had, but he didn’t, so it didn’t matter. He barely even looked at me. He just flipped through some papers while words fell out of my mouth. Things happened and things happened and things happened, and then I left his office. I got in my car and I drove around a bit until the album finished, because all of a sudden it felt like I had an obligation to listen to the whole thing, because your brain just creates stupid rules and obligations like that when you’re in stressful situations. So that’s how Scarface is tethered to that situation; to those situations. I don’t imagine he ever imagined he’d soundtrack those sorts of scenarios, but I don’t imagine he’d mind it too much, either. I hope his new album is very good. This song here, “Mental Exorcism,” is from it and it’s good. Scarface has always sounded like a very old mountain of a human, and that’s of course a compliment. It’s like he was privy to a plane of existence that most others weren’t, or aren’t, like he was delivering scripture straight from the source. He looks like it now, too. He looks old and weathered and storied, and I know it doesn’t seem like it, but that’s a compliment. Because it makes all the stuff he’s saying sound even more profound, even more powerful. Watch him in the video. Watch him absorb the terrible things that have happened to black people over the past few years. Watch him talk about them. Watch him process them. Watch him break. The way he looks matches the way he raps now. And it makes it better, somehow.",2015-09-04T13:00:37+00:00,Music,Serrano
145,"A Highly Scientific, Real-Life Exploration Into How Anyone Could Possibly Like J. Cole","J. Cole seems like a super nice guy. There’s evidence of this, like his Dollar & a Dream Tour, where he does surprise shows in cities and charges only $1 for entry. And there’s also acts like showing up and marching with protesters following the non-indictment of Daniel Pantaleo, the officer who appeared to choke Eric Garner to death on video — lending his fame to that situation and similar situations is laudable. I even read about a guy who was planning to kill himself but then didn’t because something Cole said in the song “Love Yourz” convinced him otherwise, and if that’s true then that’s also wonderful. But I think my favorite J. Cole story is the one about him telling a girl two years ago that if she graduated from high school and got into a four-year university he’d show up to her graduation, and then he actually did exactly that and also offered to help pay for her tuition. I like J. Cole as a human. His positivity is undeniable. He has good energy. That’s the most important thing, really. ??? On Friday night, I hoped for a very specific thing: that a man or a woman would be able to explain to me why J. Cole is an interesting, exciting rapper. And so I went to a place where I thought it would be easy to find many people who held that opinion. A simple joke to make here would be to say that I went to “a morgue” or “a sleep factory” or “a hospital for people who were born without ears,” but none of those are places I went, and I’m not so sure that those last two are even places that exist. Where I went was to the Cynthia Woods Mitchell Pavilion for the Houston stop of his Forest Hills Drive Tour, which was sold out, same as most every other stop he’s had this year. Here is how you find a J. Cole fan at a J. Cole concert who is willing to talk about J. Cole: Step 1: Open your eyes. Step 2: You’re done. Those are literally all the steps. That’s what I did. In the concourse area, I’d walk up to someone, then I would say, “Hi,” and when I would say “Hi” I would smile. And then I would say, “I’m Shea. I’m a writer,” and when I would say that I’d point to the press pass I was given because people will stop and talk to anyone wearing a press pass. Then I would say, “I’m wondering if you might be able to answer a question for me. I’m not a very big fan of J. Cole. I don’t think he’s that great of a rapper. But he’s very popular and so I wanted to come to his show and ask people to explain to me why he’s good. Why do you think he’s good?” At that point, one of four things would happen: FYI: All of these are better than what happens when you say you don’t like a person’s music on the Internet to someone who does like it. I don’t want to say some of the things that have been said to me, but I will tell you that after reading some of them I felt like putting my head in an oven. Talking to people in real life about conflicting music opinions is way more fulfilling. ??? Before the concert and then also after the concert, I sought out conversations with a few different people whom I knew had dealt with J. Cole on multiple occasions, either in business settings or leisure settings (or both). I wanted to get some insight into what he was like beyond what I’d happened to read on my computer. Nearly all of them responded with a version of the same answer: “He’s one of my favorite people in music. He is exactly who he presents himself as.” I was always glad to hear this response. I like J. Cole as a human. His positivity is undeniable. ??? Taylor Hill/FilmMagic J. Cole performs live in January 2015. Cole is a skilled performer in concert. That’s easy to see, even if you’re not a fan of the music he performs during the show. He is confident and capable and actively charming. An example: Prior to performing “St. Tropez,” he broke off into something like a 12-minute talk about coming from a small town filled with people who had small-town ambitions and how he couldn’t even today identify where St. Tropez is on a map. He made a comment about the fanciness of the stage and its props and the LED lights, then said, “I don’t even know what the fuck ‘LED lights’ means.” It was a funny and likable and memorable moment. He’s told that same joke at each of the tour’s stops in that same way before that same song. It’s hard to be unhappy at a J. Cole concert, even if that’s a thing you’re intending to do, which, to be clear, I certainly was not. There were nearly 17,000 people at the Houston show. It didn’t look like very many of them bothered to sit down very often during his performance. When he would start a song, everyone would lose their minds and rap a bunch of the words. There were two girls sitting in front of me who were especially animated, and next to them was a couple who were rapping the words to songs at each other, and I can’t think of a more fun thing to watch than people having fun listening to music they like. Throughout the night, I received a bunch of text messages and tweets about being at the show, things about “Are you still alive?” and “I can’t believe all of those people have confused a warm smile and mediocre rapping with greatness.” Things like that. And you know what was weird? I began to feel semi-defensive about it. I don’t know how many jokes I’ve made about J. Cole since he started to become prevalent or prominent back around 2009. If I had to guess at a number, it’d be something like, say, 100 billion. I was literally making jokes about him on Twitter as I was sitting in my seat waiting for the show to start. So I understand why I was getting those messages. But, I mean, how can anyone really be expected not to find joy in watching so many people have so much fun all at the same time? ??? When I was talking to people at the show about Cole before his set started, a few common themes emerged. They would talk about him being “relatable” and “lyrical” and “honest” and “not like most of the other rappers.” The third-best pro-Cole argument I heard was from one of the 20-plus people I emailed about him during a 45-minute rain delay between Big Sean’s set (he went on right before Cole) and Cole’s set. It came from a guy who said that he had sex with a woman while listening to J. Cole three years ago and they’re still together today, so that’s a thing I can appreciate. The second-best pro-Cole argument I heard was from a tall girl sitting three seats over me. She was discussing with her group whether or not J. Cole was a good rapper and she mentioned how the things he rapped about just moved her — I’d initially thought that that was a pretty generic answer when she gave it, but during the show she was climbing up on her seat and screaming and throwing her long arms and legs around. Her enthusiasm was literal. The best pro-Cole argument came from a guy named Mark. Mark and I spoke for several minutes about Cole. I explained to him that I didn’t like Cole’s music for this reason and that reason, and then guess what? Turns out, I already knew Mark. Before I was a writer, I was a teacher at an inner city school in Houston for nine years. I had Mark in one of my classes about six or so years ago. I didn’t even recognize him. He was 3 feet tall when I had him. He was a full-grown man on Friday. Can you even believe that? I really couldn’t. So Mark was explaining to me basically all the same things that everyone else had — that J. Cole rapped about things and feelings that were familiar to him. He rapped about being nervous or worrying about not becoming anything bigger than what he was, and so on. And when Mark was talking I couldn’t stop remembering him as a middle school student. He was a pretty popular kid. He was tiny, but he was handsome and athletic and unafraid, and that’s a great combination of traits to have in the seventh grade. As I was thinking about all that, just that moment, I experienced just a bit of self-doubt. It felt like, “Wait a second. J. Cole is lackluster, right? Uninteresting, right? Faux-insightful, right? Or have I been wrong about this all this time? Do I just not get it? Is J. Cole actually good? OH MY GOD IS J. COLE ACTUALLY GOOD?” When someone asks me why I don’t like J. Cole, my main instinct is to recite a line from an old DMX song where he rapped, “If you don’t see it, then it wasn’t meant for you to see.” And when Mark was talking, it was the first time I’d considered the possibility that it applied to me about Cole, that I couldn’t see it because it wasn’t meant for me to see. Cole fits this generation and I’m not a member of “this generation” anymore. My whole world was caving in. This was real and true existential dread. Then, as Mark was leaving, I asked if he was on Twitter so I could check in to see if he mentioned anything about the show. He said yes, and gave me his Twitter handle — it included a reference to money and also a reference to poop. I laughed, and remembered that Mark was a knucklehead. And I realized I wasn’t wrong about J. Cole after all.",2015-08-24T11:56:07+00:00,Music,Serrano
146,So You’re Saying There’s a Chance: How Meek Mill Can Still Win This Drake Beef,"MEEK MILL CAN STILL WIN THIS FIGHT. He can. For real. Someone just needs to explain to him how the Internet works. Drake has a profound understanding of the Internet’s mechanics. He always has, or at least he has always seemed to, ever since he became super famous, which is when it matters the most. That’s the whole reason he is, at the moment, atomizing poor Meek Mill’s heart and carriage and bones and e-life. I thought Meek had a much better shot at defeating Drake. I truly did. Particularly after Drake released the Meek dis track “Charged Up.” When that happened, Meek didn’t respond with a return song. He responded with two tweets. First: Baby lotion soft…… ? — Meek Mill (@MeekMill) July 26, 2015  Then, 25 minutes after that: I can tell he wrote that 1 tho…… — Meek Mill (@MeekMill) July 26, 2015  At this moment — THIS EXACT TWEET IN TIME — Meek Mill was not only beating Drake, but, more importantly, he looked to have a cursory understanding of the way in which social media judges who wins something and who loses something, which is definitely what the person who eventually defeats Drake in a public forum is going to need. His “I can tell he wrote that 1 tho……” was the absolute perfect response to “Charged Up.” It did three things: Right there, at 7:58 p.m. on July 25, Meek was winning. Sadly, it was smoke. It’s no accident that Drake titled that first dis track “Charged Up.” I’ll tell you exactly what happened (probably): He knew he was going to do a song at Meek. And he knows the way the Internet works. So he got his phone, perused the emoji catalogue, saw the phone-fully-charged emoji, saw the plug emoji, and said, “There it is. That’s what I’m gonna call it. ‘Charged Up.’” Minutes after it was released, Meek Mill’s Instagram comment section looked like this:  “Charged Up” currently has almost 5 million plays on SoundCloud. I don’t imagine more than 15 of the people who heard it thought it was actually a powerful dis record. But that wasn’t the point of it. Drake and Meek Mill are on way different tiers of popularity. Drake could’ve presented a masterful lyrical dismantling of Meek, but it would’ve only been fun to people who knew who Meek Mill was. In that sense, Drake needed to build Meek up (make him seem important) and then tear him down. He wasn’t allowed to only be concerned with making a dis song. He needed to make the disrespect inherent to it actionable and sharable for it to be the most effective. That’s the part that Meek Mill doesn’t understand. When Meek tweeted the “I can tell he wrote that 1 tho……” thing, it seemed like he knew what Drake knows: In 2015, it’s just as important to allow people to be involved in the process. That tweet is the most shared tweet Meek has ever had. Alas, it was less a calculated response and more an involuntary recoil, and that’s a strategy that will only ever work sporadically against a tactician as self-aware and maniacal as Drake. Drake sensed that he’d lost that first round, and so he came back again, this time with “Back to Back,” which, now that more people were paying attention, was allowed to stand on its own. In it, he took swipes at Meek’s thug persona, at his relationship with Nicki Minaj, and at his use of Twitter. It was set up perfectly for Meek, a former battle rapper from Philadelphia. AND HE BALKED. His response, “Wanna Know,” was dull and dreary and outdated.  In the early-to-mid-2000s, 50 Cent, who once took nine bullets that had been fired into his frame and turned them into an empire, felt compelled to drive Ja Rule into the earth because he thought he was a fraud. So that’s what 50 did, much to the delight of those who listened to rap. That’s what rap was like back then. Whether someone on a label called Murder Inc. Records had actually killed someone was a thing that rap fans cared about. Near the end of the 2000s, 50 attempted a similar takedown of Rick Ross, who had spent two years positioning himself as this drug kingpin and then was revealed to have actually been a former correctional officer. Ross initially attempted to rebuff the accusations, sat and watched as the rumors were confirmed, then admitted it was true AND DENIED THAT HE EVER DENIED IT. And do you know what happened to him? Nothing. In fact, the album that followed the controversy, 2010’s gorgeous Teflon Don, earned Ross the third Gold certification of his career. By weathering that storm, Rick Ross questioned the notion of authenticity-as-necessity in the genre. That’s why Meek’s “Wanna Know” had reverse buzz. It was detrimental to his cause. Drake realized what everyone else has seemed to realize about Meek: He was ill prepared for a rap battle in the 2015 version of its universe. It started first with pictures of Drake prepping for his set yesterday at his OVO Fest while wearing a “Free Meek Mill” T-shirt, and then morphed into full and proper anarchy when he opened his performance with both “Charged Up” and “Back to Back” while screenshots of different memes from the Internet making fun of Meek Mill were projected onto a gigantic screen behind him. DRAKE GOT MEMES FOR MEEK ALREADY UP ON THE SCREEN LMAOOOOOOOOO pic.twitter.com/5W66wjIktk — Stephen Dacres (@SRDtv) August 4, 2015  One of them was a participation award addressed to Meek for “Wanna Know.” One was a Meek Mill Amber Alert. One was a wedding picture of a bride and groom, except Meek’s face had been Photoshopped onto the bride’s and Nicki’s face onto the groom’s. He took Meek’s carcass, tied it to the back of his chariot, then drove it through Toronto. And Meek Mill can still win this fight. He’s going against Drake, as open a target as has ever existed in rap. If Meek shows even the tiniest amount of forethought or sense of humor, he can score. That’s all he needs to do. Maybe he starts the next song off with a play on those voice mail skits that Drake uses all the time. Ooh, or maybe he does a thing where he takes clips from Degrassi and uses them to have a fake conversation with Drake, like how Kendrick did with Tupac at the end of To Pimp a Butterfly. That could even be a stand-alone thing. Post it straight to Twitter or whatever. Just keep doing things like that, over and over. Can you even imagine if he did that? Can you even imagine if for one second Meek was funny? Drake’s playing a different game right now. Meek needs to join him. He needs people in Drake’s Instagram feed posting pages and pages of the same two emojis, because the response is as critical as the music. If he does that, he can win. Or at least make it close. Or at least make it not a bulldozing. Please, Meek. You can do this, Meek. We need this, Meek. Good luck, Meek.",2015-08-04T12:32:03+00:00,Music,Serrano
147,Polishing the Apple: What ‘Dangerous Minds’ and Other Movies Get Right and Wrong About Teachers,"Yesterday, summer ended for the teachers in the Houston Independent School District. School is back. Today, Dangerous Minds, a movie about a discharged Marine who attempts to teach disadvantaged high school students that they are not victims by giving them candy bars, celebrates its 20th anniversary.   Both of these occasions are of particular interest to me because from 2006 to 2015 I worked as a teacher at a large inner-city school in Houston. I love(d) teaching and I love teacher movies.  If I were to try to place an exact time stamp on it, I’d guess I decided I wanted to be a teacher somewhere around 1991, and I’m almost certain it had a lot to do with the episode of Saved by the Bell in which Mr. Belding’s cooler brother, Rod Belding, showed up and worked as a substitute teacher.   I understand that that’s dumb, but I imagine it’s how lots of these sorts of things work out. It’s how people decide there are occupations they love, how they become doctors or scuba divers or harpists or whatever. You get an image in your head when you’re younger, and  it just grows in your brain into this grander and grander thing, and then boom — all of a sudden you’re inspired.   When I saw Cooler Belding — or, really, when I saw him or Mr. Turner or ANY cool young male teacher on TV, it just looked like the best kind of existence. They were always wearing blazers, they were always putting their feet up on desks (and occasionally taking exaggerated bites out of apples while doing so), and they always seemed to be saying these either very dramatic things that no teacher of mine had ever actually said — usually something like “Turn your book to page 43, and now rip that page out, because you don’t need it, because the world around you is what you need to study.” So I got lucky, I guess. I knew what I was going to do with the rest of my life pretty early on, and I knew what I was going to wear while I did it.  The first time I watched Dangerous Minds, I thought it was great — partly because I was 15 years old at the time, and so I wasn’t very good at figuring out what was good or bad yet. But another part was that (obviously) I had not yet been a teacher. Because when I watched it on cable after I’d been a teacher for awhile, it felt like one great big FOH. A bunch of the movies about teachers are like that, really. I mean, to be clear, that doesn’t mean that I don’t like them, because I definitely do and I will definitely watch any movie about any teacher, even Cameron Diaz’s Bad Teacher, which is less a movie and more a stomach flu. It just means that they don’t get a bunch of the stuff right. They get SOME of it right. They get PORTIONS of it right. They get PIECES of it right. But there are some really big things that get Hollywood-washed to make them more palatable.  So this is a thing about what teacher movies get right about teaching — and what teacher movies get wrong about teaching.  Paramount Pictures This is my worst thing. Teaching movies are always set around a teacher and one particular group of students. This is rarely (if ever) the case in real life. I understand that it’s this way because otherwise the movie would be unwatchable and it would be nearly impossible to move any plot forward, but still. My first year as a teacher, I taught two sixth-grade classes, two seventh-grade classes, and two eighth-grade classes, and each of them had somewhere between 25 and 30 kids. That’s almost 180 kids. Hilary Swank had, like, 22 kids total in Freedom Writers, and one of them was Mario. Mario has never caused any sort of trouble. The most aggressive thing Mario ever did was wear boot-cut jeans in the “Let Me Love You” video.  The best example of this is probably Ryan Gosling’s Mr. Dunne in Half Nelson, although I certainly do not want to imply that there’s an inordinate number of teachers who freebase cocaine in their off time. Students are always surprised and excited to find out that teachers aren’t robots. I still remember the time when I saw one of my seventh-grade teachers at the mall when I was a kid. It felt like how Arnold Schwarzenegger appeared to feel the first time he got a good glimpse of the Predator. I was completely shocked and flummoxed.   It usually happens during the middle of a lesson or while the teacher is giving a speech or about to make a profound connection with a kid. It’s supposed to be a dramatic hold or a We’re Almost To The Breakthrough moment. That’s not what I see when that happens, though. You know what I see? What I see is poor planning on the teacher’s part. If there’s one single thing on earth that teachers know, it’s when the bell is going to ring. That shit gets embedded into your bones by the end of the first week of the school year. I don’t know my youngest son’s birthday, but I know that the first-period bell at the school I taught at last year rang at exactly 8:07:40 a.m. every morning even though it was actually supposed to ring at 8:10 a.m.  Ms. Johnson: I would like to help you, Emilio. Emilio: Thank you very much. And how would you like to do that? You gonna give me some good advice? Just say no? You’re gonna get me off the streets? Well, forget it. How the fuck are you gonna save me from my life, huh?! The first time this happened to me, it just really obliterated my whole everything. It was one of my special-ed students, this boy named Vincente1 — I taught him for seventh and eighth grade. He was incredible; possibly the most driven, most inspired kid I’d had up to that point. He never missed class, never missed an assignment, never did anything except try to be better than he was when he walked in. But he had a severe learning disability, one that wouldn’t let him process any problem that was designed for anyone more advanced than a first grader. At the end of his eighth-grade year, after I’d passed out the final report cards and the papers that said whether the students had passed or failed, he stayed around for a moment after I’d dismissed the class. He waited for everyone to leave. Then he walked up to me. He’d failed again. He looked me right in my face, blinked his gigantic eyes a few times, then said, “Mr. Serrano, I don’t think it’s fair that I failed. I try harder than everyone else. Kids who don’t work as hard as me passed. What do I do?” I didn’t have an answer. It felt like I’d been shoved out of a plane. I didn’t know what to do. All I could think about was not crying, which I wasn’t doing a very good job of. I will remember Vincente forever. Leaving your students alone in your classroom for even 30 seconds is basically the same as saying, “Hey, kids, why don’t some of you hop into the closet and have sex for a bit?” Don’t leave your students alone. Don’t ever leave your students alone.   Fact.  In Dangerous Minds, Ms. Johnson tried teaching her kids karate, and then after that she wrote a sentence about dying on the board. In Dead Poets Society, Mr. Keating stood on the desks and recited poetry. In The Substitute, Tom Berenger’s Mr. Shale catches a soda can thrown at the back of his head and then rifles it back at the face of the student who threw it at him. Mr. Shale is secretly a legendary figure among male teachers in public schools. Every teacher you’ve ever had since 1996 was quietly pretending to be a covert mercenary, I can promise you that.  There’s always a scene in these movies where a teacher is sitting at a kitchen table at 2 a.m. grading papers (which is super surprising, since they only have that one class to tend to). Nobody really does that. It’s like the teacher version of an R&B singer singing about making love until the sun comes up. It’s some cool shit to say, but nobody really does that, or even expects you to do that.   In Dangerous Minds, it’s Emilio, who is smart and aggressive and impossible. There’s a scene early in the movie where, after Emilio derails another of Ms. Johnson’s lessons, a girl approaches her and says, “If you wanna get the class to listen, get Emilio.” This is an accurate enough thing, at least in classrooms like the one depicted in Dangerous Minds. Those classes, where you have a disproportionate number of students who are listed as “behavior students”2 or discipline problems, generally tend to follow the lead of an alpha student. If he/she feels like being engaged that day, then so will his/her flock. If not, then nope.  When I first began teaching, I assumed a quick way to scan for the alpha student would be to look for the biggest or oldest kid. This, I learned pretty quickly, is right less than half the time. More often than not, the alpha student is the one in the class who’s done something to gain some sort of notoriety at school, like getting caught on campus the year before with drugs, or throwing a desk at a teacher or something doofy like that. This past year, the alpha student in my behavior class was a boy named Gustavo.3 He was a nice enough kid, but he’d grown up in a situation where it’d been made clear to him that the people who were supposed to love him and care about him were never going to do that, and so he carried all of that turbulence and hurt into school with him each day. There was one instance during the year, after we’d gotten to know each other fairly well, when he wandered into class several minutes late.  I asked him to wait outside while I got the rest of the students started on whatever thing it was they were working on that day. He got frustrated, walked to the door, then slammed it shut as he walked out. A minute or so later, there was a knock. It was the assistant principal. She’d been making her rounds and saw Gustavo standing outside, so she came by to see what was up. When I stepped out of the room, I could see that he was very angry. I told him I wasn’t going to let him into the room like that. The A.P. said she’d take him down to her office to calm down. He said, “You’re not gonna let me in?!” I said, “No. Come back in a few minutes.” He said, “Man, fuck you! Fuck you and fuck her and fuck this school!” He stormed off. He didn’t even make it halfway down the hallway before he’d removed his shirt and told me to [ACTION] his [BODY PART]. He got suspended for a few days for that. His first day back, he walked up to me, smiled, then said, “That’s my bad about what happened the other day. I get like that.” He was very charming when he wanted to be. Maybe two hours later, while I was walking back to my class from a break, I saw him running down the hallway as fast as he could. As he passed me, he shouted, “I’m not going to be in class today, Mr. Serrano,” and then disappeared around a corner laughing. Several seconds later, our school’s police officer came flying down the hallway shouting something about Gustavo into his walkie-talkie. I laughed a bit.   I played dodgeball once. A kid hit me in the chest. That’s as close as it got.  Sometimes it’s something simple like you just give a kid a nickname or talk to him or her for a minute about something that isn’t school-related. Sometimes it’s something a little more time-consuming, like you set up a Saturday tutorials session for several of your students. Sometimes it’s something deliberate and delicate, like making home visits to meet the parents of students you’d otherwise never meet. But the kid has to feel like you’re invested in him or her and not just his or her academic success. (The other version of this — the student buy-in — is something that is often misrepresented in teacher movies pretty regularly. It rarely ever happens all at once and it almost never happens because you give a rousing soliloquy.)  While I was working on this, I polled somewhere near 30 different teachers to get a consensus of the top five fictional movie teachers. I was surprised that Jack Black’s Mr. S from School of Rock showed up more than zero times. He abandoned the school’s curriculum, tricked the kids into forming a band that he was to be the leader of, then kidnapped them and took them to perform in a battle-of-the-bands contest in a seedy rock club. You can try to church it up and say he was trying to teach the kids a lesson about living outside of the expectations their parents placed on them, but most of that stuff was an accident. He was being petty more than anything else. (He’d been kicked out of his band and was determined to beat them in a battle of the bands.) Also — and how could anyone ever forget this? — there was literally a part where he lost the drummer kid and found him in the back of a band’s van, and that’s just way too creepy for me to feel comfortable with.  One of my buddies is a professor at a very prestigious university. And there’s this great story I like to tell about how he did some outright amazing things for a student of his over a couple of months. So let me tell it to you. First, the student –- he wasn’t even supposed to be one of his students, he was just a normal guy that my professor friend happened upon — but the professor recognized that he was brilliant, and so he took him on as a personal project, an opportunity that any number of young academics would’ve cut off their own noses to get. He rescued this guy from going to jail for an extended amount of time. He lifted him up out of a menial and dead-end job and placed him a very good situation. He called in personal favors to set up interviews for the student with powerful businesses that could’ve ended with him having a job that would’ve immediately moved him from poverty to well-off. The professor even went so far as to arrange visits with several doctors after he realized that his student was suffering from some real mental issues. The student kept trying to run off the doctors with his unbearable crassness, but my professor pal didn’t give up. He just kept dialing numbers and bringing in people until he found his student a psychologist who legitimately changed his student’s life for the better.  That’s all incredible and amazing, right? Well, guess what, I have a surprise for you. My professor friend isn’t actually my professor friend. It’s Professor Lambeau, the unlikable math genius from Good Will Hunting.  There’s an argument to be made that Lambeau tried to press his own ideas and ideals onto Will, sure. But, to me, it looked like he only ever did so out of altruism. He wanted Will to make a difference, to be meaningful in the only way that Lambeau knew how to be meaningful. Lambeau was kind of hard to get along with because he was smarter than most people, and he’s made that his identity, and that’s very annoying. But maybe that doesn’t mean he’s a dick. Maybe it just means that everyone else is too sensitive and romantic. Professor Lambeau: misunderstood and underappreciated. Like maybe every teacher. Like maybe every teacher movie.

148,Life Lessons I Taught My Children After Seeing ‘Pixels’,"My sons and I saw Adam Sandler’s Pixels the night it came out. Here is a summary of the movie, which takes place over a 33-year period of time, but I’ve shrunk it down to fewer than 160 words: (1982) Kid Adam Sandler is very good at video games. Kid Josh Gad is a weirdo conspiracy theorist who likes Yoo-hoo and is also very good at video games. Kid Kevin James is not very good at video games but he is very good at the crane machine. They all play in a big gaming tournament. Kid Adam Sandler loses the final match to Kid Peter Dinklage. He’s devastated. (2015) Grown Adam Sandler installs TVs and things like that for people doing better in life than he is. Grown Josh Gad is a hermit. Grown Peter Dinklage is a convict in prison. Grown Kevin James is the goddamned president. Aliens come to Earth and try to destroy it, and they do so as giant real-life versions of old video games. Sandler and crew have to work together to defeat them (Dinklage is released from prison to do so), which they do, though not without a certain amount of trouble. –end– Now, I understand that technically Pixels is a bad movie. There are very big holes in the plot; it’s supposed to be a comedy but there are not very many good jokes; it seems like an obvious attempt to siphon a whole lot of money out of a thing that people care a great deal about, and that’s always offensive; Adam Sandler is in it; and so forth. But it’s kind of actually not a bad movie if you watch it without thinking about anything, or, more specifically, if you watch it with your children, which, again, is what I did the night that it was released. The boys and I, we play video games together. I am 34 years old and have an old NES with a bunch of games, so they play those games with me. The boys are twins. They’re 8 years old and have a Nintendo Wii U and a handheld game system called a Nintendo 3DS, so I play their games with them. It’s not a thing we do a lot. We maybe play together once a week. But it’s a thing we do often enough that we can have conversations about it. That’s how we ended up at Pixels. And that’s probably why I didn’t hate it. When it was over, when we were walking out, one of them said, “That was SO fun.” The other said, “I LOOOOOVED it.” I asked if they wanted to go home and play Donkey Kong for a bit before bed because he’s the main bad-guy boss in the movie. They said yes, so that’s what we did. ??? A part of being a dad is that you have to ruin good organic moments by fumbling your way through teachable moments with your children. It’s just the way it goes. You take something that’s happened or is happening, assign some sort of grander meaning to it, then try to explain how the way someone plays basketball is the way that person lives his or her life or whatever while your kid looks at you like, “What the hell, dad?” That’s what happened in the days after we watched Pixels. We talked about the games they played in the movie and lessons we could extract from them, then also about some games we like that weren’t in Pixels and the lessons we could find in them. Fair warning that the following lessons contain even more spoilers for Pixels, a movie you do not really need to see anyway. Galaga  This is the first method of attack the aliens use to attack Earth in Pixels. The way the game works is you’re a spaceship and you have to shoot aliens in space and that’s that. There aren’t any explanations at the beginning; it just starts. You’re not told if you’re a good guy or a bad guy, you’re not told why you’re fighting the aliens, you’re not told where you’re from, you’re not told anything at all. All you know is that the aliens are looking to kill you, so better just go on ahead and kill them first. The Lesson: In the interest of self-preservation, it is often advisable to shoot first, ask questions later. Young Jeezy would’ve done especially well in space warfare, I suspect. Arkanoid  Arkanoid is that game where there were a bunch of bricks stacked up at the top of the screen and you controlled a little bar at the bottom that you could move left to right. You had to try to bounce a ball off it to break the bricks. (This was the second way the aliens attacked Earth. They destroyed the Taj Mahal and then also stole an Indian man as a trophy. I’m not lying.) The best way to play this game (at least in the early levels) is to carve out an early path so you can get the destructo-ball up behind the blocks, because that wrecks a whole bunch of them while posing little risk to you. The Lesson: Work smarter, not harder. (Dads LOVE clichés.) Centipede  This is the third game the aliens play against the humans. In Centipede, you play as a tiny little nub that only exists to kill centipedes by shooting them. If you shoot a centipede in the body, the centipede splits in two and, just great, now you have two centipedes trying to destroy you. The trick is you have to shoot them in the head. That’s how you kill them. And it’s what Sandler and Gad try to explain to the Navy SEALs who are supposed to kill the centipede in the movie, only it turns out that, despite this particular group of soldiers being among the deadliest and most elite, they are not that great at shooting things in the head. The SEALs shoot the centipede in the belly, it splits in two, then one of the two centipedes catches a SEAL and kills him. Sandler, frustrated that nobody is listening to him — or, if they are listening, that they aren’t good enough to kill the centipede — jumps in, then Gad jumps in, too, and together they destroy the two centipedes. The Lesson: I suppose one good lesson is if you want to kill something, a good place to start is by shooting it in the head. That seems a bit rough for children, though, so let’s lean the other way. A different lesson is if you’re not properly trained to do something, like how the SEALs weren’t properly trained to defeat pixelated death centipedes, then get someone who is, otherwise somebody could get hurt or, worse, eaten by a gigantic digital bug. Pac-Man  This is the fourth game the aliens play against the humans. In this version, Pac-Man cruises around the city eating things. Sandler and his friends drive Mini Coopers around and act as the ghosts. One of the drivers gets his hand eaten off by Pac-Man. The humans end up winning this game, but it turns out they actually end up losing the game when it’s revealed that Dinklage used a cheat code to help catch Pac-Man, which he also did as a kid to beat Sandler in that tournament, which is all figured out when his sunglasses get fished out of a river (I’m not lying). The Lesson: If you drive a Mini Cooper, there’s a solid chance you’ll lose a limb. Another Lesson: If you let a guy out of prison, he’s probably going to do some prison-type shit when he’s out. That’s sort of the whole reason he was there in the first place. You shouldn’t be all that surprised. Donkey Kong  This is the last game the aliens play against the humans. Sandler ends up killing Donkey Kong by hitting him in the chest with a giant hammer. Lesson: Gorillas are super good with barrels, but they’re not that great with hammers. (Turtles, on the other hand, are quite good at hammers.) Mario Kart 8 (Nintendo Wii U)  If the boys and I play Mario Kart 8 straight-up — if we play so that it’s just a legit race — I win probably 85 percent of the time. It’s not that hard of a game. You drive around a track, avoid some hazards. Add to that my 18 years of real-life driving experience and that I’ve seen Days of Thunder 10 or so times, and it was only a matter of time before I became a Mario Kart titan. The only problem, though, is that they figured this out a few months ago, so we never, ever play Every Man For Himself now. It’s never all three of us (plus the computer) racing and trying to win anymore. The mechanics of the race haven’t changed, nor has the main objective, but their strategy has. Before the beginning of each race, they designate one person “The Destroyer,” and let me tell you what: Screw Destroyers. The Destroyer is essentially a suicide bomber. He has zero interest in winning the race. His whole objective, the only reason he exists, is to make sure I do not win the race. He tails me the entire time, waiting for either an opportunity to bump me off the track (at Rainbow Road, for example) or hit me with a turtle shell (very infuriating) or a banana peel (truly embarrassing) or a shrinking lightning bolt, after the last of which he will run me over and then wait for me to unflatten myself so he can do it again. I wish I could explain to you how frustrating it is to play this way — how crushing it is. I’ve been beaten so many times this way that when we play now I’m so psyched out that they don’t even really have to actually be doing it. I’m driving in my rearview mirror. My win percentage has plummeted. I’m doing well if I don’t finish in last place. The Lesson: Teamwork makes the dream work. Super Smash Bros. (Nintendo Wii U)  In Super Smash Bros., up to eight participants fight each other to determine the best fighter of all. The same thing happened here that happened with Mario Kart 8. Once I started to show a tiny bit of dominance, they teamed up. They would both spend the entire time only attacking me. And once I got to a point where I could even kind of fend them off a bit, they implemented a new strategy: They’d wait for me to pick my guy (Captain Falcon forever), then they’d both pick the same person (Diddy Kong, usually) and then they’d pick five other Diddy Kongs for the computer to play as. Have you ever tried to fight seven Diddy Kongs? It’s like being in the worst kind of zoo, my man. It’s like that scene from The Matrix Reloaded in which Neo fights the gaggle of Agent Smiths, only guess what: I’m no Neo. I’m probably not even a Mr. Anderson. The Lesson: Never give your enemy even a whiff of life. The Other Lesson: The number of Diddys that Daddy has to fight is directly related to the number of curse words he’ll say. Tecmo Super Bowl (NES)  This is the game I make the boys play after we play a round or two of Mario Kart or Super Smash Bros., because I like to try to wash the scent of victory off their tiny chests as fast as possible. I always pick the Raiders and I always run Bo Jackson for 700-plus yards. That’s a little thing called alpha arrogance. The Lesson: Give the ball to your best player. The Other Lesson: Dads are very petty. Bad Dudes (NES)  You have to rescue the president, who has been kidnapped by ninjas. When you do (which is no small task, mind you), he invites you to go for a burger with him, then he laughs at you for thinking he’d actually go get a burger with a dude, let alone a bad dude. The Lesson: Do not depend on the government to ever be grateful for anything. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (NES)  The Lesson: I hate electric seaweed. The Other Lesson: If you get seriously injured, just eat some pizza. Both solid pieces of advice.",2015-07-28T13:48:26+00:00,Movies,Serrano
149,"Beat Down, But Never Beaten: Conor McGregor Is the UFC’s Most Important Fighter","Let me make a reasonable assumption: You are not very into MMA and the UFC. Here, then, are some pieces of information that are important to know for the duration of this article: • Conor McGregor, a 145-pound, 5-foot-9 Irishman, is a very good fighter. • Chad Mendes, who fought McGregor this past weekend for the interim featherweight championship in Las Vegas, is likely a more skilled fighter. • McGregor was supposed to fight Jose Aldo, the best fighter on earth, for the actual championship, but Aldo backed out weeks before the fight after he said he broke a rib during training. • The UFC has sought to make Conor into a pay-per-view draw. It spent millions to first promote the Aldo-McGregor fight and then the McGregor-Mendes fight. I want you to notice that every one of those bullets includes a reference to McGregor, and that’s because he is the most important and popular fighter in the UFC. Some of that, of course, comes down to his ability as a fighter — he is undefeated in the UFC, and he’s ended 13 of his last 14 MMA fights by KO, TKO, or submission — but it’s also largely due to the ultra-brash persona that he’s masterfully crafted. McGregor is the kind of guy you either deeply hate or forever love, and if you don’t yet have an opinion on the matter, the following anecdote will help you figure out where your feelings land: Late last year, McGregor and Mendes both appeared on the same episode of BT Sport’s Beyond the Octagon. Before the show, McGregor had made fun of Mendes for being short: He’s 5-foot-6. So Mendes started things off by asking McGregor how tall he was, and that ended up being a mistake. McGregor is an A-plus instigator and needler. It’s actually part of his fight strategy. He’s the White Men Can’t Jump Woody Harrelson of the UFC. And as soon as he realized that Mendes was the tiniest bit sensitive about his height, he threw dart after dart. Mendes tried to keep pace, but McGregor gave him no air. An early and oft-used criticism of McGregor has been that he’s not very good at wrestling, and so Mendes, who happens to be very good at that exact thing, tried to pivot the conversation. “Conor, Conor … do you know what wrestling is,” Mendes asked, trying to be dismissive. But McGregor ignored the question completely, responding, “I can rest my balls on your forehead.” That’s McGregor. Some people thought it was hilarious; others thought it was hideous. Everybody thought something, though, and that’s the point. Josh Hedges/Zuffa LLC/Getty Images Let me tell you what it sounds like to be in a large room filled with a lot of people in Las Vegas when McGregor knocks someone out: It’s super fucking loud. It’s loud and it’s crazy and it’s frenetic and if there were a form or something you could fill out to change your ethnicity, I’d have gone from Mexican to Irish between the time McGregor hit Mendes and when Mendes’s crumpled body hit the floor. Now, McGregor probably should’ve lost the fight. He is an incredible athlete. He’s lithe and graceful and moves like he’s made of liquid metal. And he’s got a better chin than anyone had anticipated: He only ever responded to getting punched by Mendes with either contempt or open taunting. But for all his antics, for all his out-of-the-ring talking and his in-the-ring, during-the-fight talking, he was getting beaten through two rounds Saturday. In fact, for much of the second round, Mendes handled him easily, and he very nearly choked McGregor out in the final minute. Moments later, though, Mendes had lost. McGregor wiggled free of Mendes’s attempted guillotine, stood up, and charged. With McGregor, previously seconds away from being submitted, now suddenly attacking, it felt like the whole universe was vibrating. It seemed like everyone watching knew what was about to happen. McGregor hit Mendes, then he hit Mendes, then he HIT Mendes. With 10 seconds left in the round, McGregor tagged Mendes in the jaw with a right jab and then followed that with a devastating left cross. It looked like Mendes had been hit by an anvil that’d been fired out of a cannon that was positioned at the front of a very fast-moving train. Once McGregor connected, it was clear that the fight was over. A guy holding an Ireland flag hugged a guy wearing a Larry Bird jersey, and I don’t know that I’ve ever seen two people more connected in any one moment. It was incredible, but it also felt important. I’ve watched the UFC regularly since the late ’90s, and I can remember feeling that same way only two other times: The first was when Vitor Belfort hyper-punched Wanderlei Silva into infinity in 1998:  This one, I’ll admit, contains a certain amount of bias. Vitor Belfort is the first MMA fighter I ever really loved, and watching him do this to a guy who called himself “The Axe Murderer” was so invigorating. I remember renting the fight video at Blockbuster four, five, or six times because that’s what you had to do if you wanted to see something more than once back then. And the second time was when Matt Hughes slammed Frank Trigg and then rear naked choked him in their second fight in 2005. It’s the ending to what is likely the greatest UFC fight of all time:  McGregor is not the best fighter in the UFC, but right now he’s the most exciting. Seeing him win a fight he (probably) should’ve lost was basically the best-case scenario. UFC 189 earned an estimated $7.2 million in live gate, a record for MMA in the United States. And Dana White, president of the UFC, said afterward that the pay-per-view buys looked to be heading toward exceeding 1 million, which is a mammoth number. I can’t wait for the McGregor-Aldo fight. I can’t wait for McGregor-Whatever. Everything he does in the near future will be an event. And everyone will be exultant over it or exasperated by it.",2015-07-13T16:42:23+00:00,UFC,Serrano
150,The Vin Diesel Character Matrix,"Just a few nights ago, I was out at a bar. Several people were there, and the conversation was good and lively and important. One of the people there was Alex Pappademas, who writes about things for Grantland. He’d come from watching a preview screening of Vin Diesel’s new movie, The Last Witch Hunter (which he wrote about today). When he told me where he’d been, I had only one question for him. “How was the movie?” I asked, because let me tell you what: I am a big Vin Diesel fan. I like his face and I like his voice and I like how safe I feel when I’m watching him and I like that he never dies in movies and I really like his face, so I’ll say that twice. But so Alex smiled and looked at me and said, “I’m excited to see The Last Witch Hunter 2.” It was the best possible answer he could have given. Vin Diesel has been in many movies since writing, directing, and starring in 1997’s Strays, but his most enjoyable stuff has been attached to franchises. There’s of course the Fast & Furious franchise, and also the Riddick franchise, and we’re just getting into the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise, which will be great, I’m sure. I’m not certain why he’s so franchise-prone, but he is, and again: I love him, so the more of him I can get, the better. So let’s do this. Let’s you and me look at all the characters Diesel has played over these past two decades or so. And let’s place them into a matrix to see if we can’t find some patterns and other compelling things. And let’s start with the least difficult thing I can think of, which is to answer fake questions that I’m asking myself. What am I about to look at? The Vin Diesel Character Matrix. What does that mean? Well, it means that you’re going to look at an infographic that examines the roles Diesel has played in his movies over the past 18 years. What, precisely, does the matrix do? It places 13 separate Diesel movie characters1 in quadrants determined by the following qualities: coolness, uncoolness, loyalty, and treacherousness. All the way up at the top are his most cool characters and all the way down at the bottom are his least cool. All the way to the left are his most treacherous roles, and all the way to the right are his most loyal. Where one of his characters is placed on the matrix will tell you all you need to know about that character’s makeup. I suspect you’d have been able to figure all this out just by looking at the chart. How were the roles chosen? As of this moment, Vin Diesel has been in 21 movies. Within those 21, he’s played 14 characters (it’s not 21 because of the franchises). His actions as each character in each of those movies were measured and weighed as they related to the aforementioned characteristics. That seems like a lot. Yeah, I’m kind of churching it up some. That’s just how it goes sometimes. I don’t agree with the placement of one of the roles on the matrix here. To whom should I complain? Yo mama. This started out sounding legit, but it’s devolving pretty quickly. Perhaps we should just get to the matrix? Agreed. Here it is: Shea Serrano The most obvious thing here is the grouping of the roles. What’s funny is that when my editor and I were talking about putting this character matrix together, the joke was, “Wouldn’t it be funny if we just put them all bunched up together in one section?” But then when I started building the matrix out, it was just like, “Oh shit. They actually all do get bunched up together.” You kind of don’t realize it until it’s laid out like that, but man, Vin Diesel is a very cool, very loyal guy in movies (those two things are probably related). I can’t think of one other person whose character matrix would end up looking like this one. Can you? Jason Statham, maybe? Or maybe Liam Neeson if you look at his filmography only since 2008 and ignore a few movies (A Million Ways to Die in the West, Ted 2, Battleship, and so on). I don’t know, man. It’s impressive. I imagine someone will use it as evidence that Diesel isn’t that great of an actor, and maybe he isn’t, but he is a super-clutch movie star, and sometimes that’s way more meaningful. Let’s do some more notes from the matrix, but let’s do them as a “finish this sentence” exercise, because that’s always fun. Vin Diesel’s best scene is … Easy. Diesel’s best scene is the part in The Fast and the Furious after he and Brian (Paul Walker) race for the first time. Diesel’s character, Dom, beats Brian, who ruins Dom’s car, but when he confronts Brian about it, Brian laughs and says, “I almost had you,” and so then Dom goes into his “Ask any real racer … ” monologue. He touches on all the different versions of Vin Diesel that are the best. He makes his frustrated face: Universal Then transitions into his inquisitive face: Universal Note: I love Vin Diesel’s inquisitive face. Vin Diesel asking questions is always a wonderful thing, because he does so almost exclusively as a means of positioning himself into the control seat of a conversation. Top three Vin Diesel Being Inquisitive moments: What I’m saying is: When Vin Diesel’s inquisitive face shows up, some great shit is about to happen. In this scene he goes from that inquisitive face to his incredulous face: Universal And from there he hits his pity face: Universal After that it’s his mocking face: Universal Back to the incredulous face: Universal (It seems clear that the guy in the black hat here was 100 percent not expecting to have Vin Diesel speak a complete sentence to him. He looks so happy. He forgot he was on camera in that moment. And Vin never even flinched. He was in total control. He was a god surrounded by worshipers. It’s so beautiful to watch.) Then to his sincere and insightful face: Universal Note: Vin Diesel saying sincere and insightful things in movies is maybe the only thing better than Vin Diesel asking questions in movies, and the only example that needs to be cited here is his “I don’t have friends. I got family” from Furious 7.2 Then it’s the FOH face: Universal Gorgeous. Then it’s the SUPER FOH FOOTBALL SPIKE CELEBRATION face: Universal Super gorgeous. This is the only movie in his career in which he hit all of those faces, and for sure it’s the best scene of his life, and I feel like I should point out that he touched on all of those emotions in less than a minute, so maybe you and I should revisit the thing about him possibly not being that great of an actor, because he is clearly a genius. Vin Diesel’s best movie character is … I feel bad that you are even asking me this. Vin Diesel’s worst movie character is … I’m still pretty upset that his agent talked him into taking on The Pacifier, because that shit could have gone south pretty quickly. That was 2005. He’d already started the Fast franchise and the Riddick franchise, but he’d also done Knockaround Guys (REMEMBER THE 500 FIGHTS SCENE????????), xXx, Saving Private Ryan (OH MY GOD REMEMBER THE “IT’S GOT BLOOD ON IT” LINE FROM WHEN HE KNEW HE WAS DYING AFTER HE’D BEEN SHOT BY THE SNIPER WHILE TRYING TO SAVE THE LITTLE GIRL?), and A Man Apart. If they’d have talked him into doing The Pacifier 2, then we probably have a different Vin Diesel career, you know what I’m saying? Because then he’s on that Kiddie Movie Money Train. We probably still get him as Groot in Guardians of the Galaxy but maybe we don’t get any more Fast movies or Riddick movies. I can’t even think about that. I refuse to think about any line of reality that doesn’t include fight scenes between the Rock and Vin Diesel and also Jason Statham and Vin Diesel and also A Tank and Vin Diesel. I won’t. I will not. I simply will not. Vin Diesel’s most underappreciated movie character is … This is a better one. Vin Diesel’s most underrated movie character is actually Jackie DiNorscio, the affable mafia criminal who decides to take on the criminal justice system so none of his friends will have to go to prison in Find Me Guilty. It’s a really terrible movie, except it isn’t. Vin Diesel’s career as an action movie star in the ’80s would have been … Not that great. Vin Diesel is a perfect action movie star for this generation. He is big and tough (applicable in the ’80s, for sure) but he’s also quietly complicated and secretly a very lovable mush (not applicable in the ’80s). It just doesn’t translate. There was never a moment during, say, Commando, when you were like, “I wonder what’s really going on in Arnold’s heart right now.” It was always clear and linear: Some people took his daughter, so now some people have to die. That’s all it was. Same with, say, Stallone in Cobra or Chuck Norris in Lone Wolf McQuade. It wasn’t until Swayze showed up in Road House that we started to see that transition into action stars who were allowed to be something more complicated than just death machines. You could probably argue that it was Bruce Willis in Die Hard who instigated that change. In fact, yeah, let’s do that. Swayze was more obvious with his intent, but Willis got there first, and he was better at it, so let’s give that to him. Maybe an even more important reason why Vin wouldn’t have ascended to the levels he’s been able to get to today, though, is that there just aren’t very many doofy one-liners in his movies, and that was a significant part of being an ’80s action star. The closest I can remember Vin getting to delivering one of those was when he was asked in The Chronicles of Riddick how someone gets eyes like his (they glowed) and he responded, “You gotta kill a few people.” But it’s not the same. Vin Diesel is … Fucking perfect.",2015-10-23T15:47:02+00:00,Movies,Serrano
151,Bond by the Numbers: Who Should Replace Daniel Craig as 007?,"Daniel Craig, it would appear, does not want to be James Bond anymore. And that’s fine. He has done a very good job at it and deserves to be tired of the role. More than being fine, though, it’s fun, because it allows for the “Who should be the next James Bond?” conversation to happen naturally, and people get to pretend that they’re really invested in it for a little while before discarding it, like the results of the Olympics or the expiration date on bread. Rather than churn out a These Guys Could Be the Next Bond list, though, let’s be a little more involved and complicated and specific, because this is a very important decision. Let’s list the people who could possibly play Bond (based on strong recent performances in movies from 2014 to now), and then let’s list all the skills required of a James Bond, and then we can just cross off the names who don’t meet a requirement, and we’ll do that until there’s only one person left, and malibooyah: Bond by elimination, which is really the only way a Bond should ever be chosen. Twenty potential new James Bonds: A few surprises in there, I’m sure, but a case can be made for each and every one. The prerequisites to be James Bond: Prerequisite 1: The new James Bond has to be good at not being Ryan Reynolds.  Oh, man. I guess that gets rid of Ryan Reynolds? Cold world. Crazy that he was eliminated before the raptors from Jurassic World. That’s just how it goes sometimes, I suppose. Remaining Options: David Oyelowo, Tom Hardy, Jack O’Connell, Rodrigo Santoro, Groot, Tom Hiddleston, Jason Statham, Sam Worthington, Michael B. Jordan, Channing Tatum, one of the raptors from Jurassic World, Idris Elba, Chris Pratt, Jon Hamm, Michael Fassbender, Shia LaBeouf, Don “The Dragon” Wilson, The Rock, Vin Diesel. Prerequisite 2: The new James Bond has to be good at being tough, or at least appearing tough.  The worst person to play Bond was David Niven, star of the non-canon parody adaptation of Casino Royale from 1967, and it was mostly because he was so waifish and flimsy. And I don’t want you to confuse “waifish and flimsy” with meaning he was just a slight guy, because Pierce Brosnan was very narrow and he’s the deadliest Bond ever (he killed 47 in GoldenEye alone). I just mean that a James Bond needs to be a presence. He needs to be able to walk in the room and have somebody say, “Who’s that?” and another person say, “I don’t know, but I probably wouldn’t fuck with him if I were you.” David Niven didn’t look like that. David Niven looked like someone who would talk to you for a long time about very fine and delicious oats.2 So if the new Bond needs to be tough (or at least look tough), then that means we lose Tom Hiddleston, Rodrigo Santoro, and Jack O’Connell now. Also, Jon Hamm gets eliminated here, too. He’s semi-rugged and certainly manly, but it’s not the type of manliness that manifests itself in toughness, if that makes sense. He’s tough the way new leather shoes are tough, in that they’re sturdy, but you’re mostly hoping to keep them clean and shiny. Remaining Options: David Oyelowo, Tom Hardy, Groot, Jason Statham, Sam Worthington, Michael B. Jordan, Channing Tatum, one of the raptors from Jurassic World, Idris Elba, Chris Pratt, Michael Fassbender, Shia LaBeouf, Don “The Dragon” Wilson, The Rock, Vin Diesel Prerequisite 3 (and counterpoint to Prerequisite 2): He has to be tough, or at least appear tough, without being a cartoon.  Adios, Mr. Statham. You lasted longer than most expected, I’m sure. Remaining Options: David Oyelowo, Tom Hardy, Groot, Sam Worthington, Michael B. Jordan, Channing Tatum, one of the raptors from Jurassic World, Idris Elba, Chris Pratt, Michael Fassbender, Shia LaBeouf, Don “The Dragon” Wilson, The Rock, Vin Diesel Prerequisite 4: The new James Bond has to not be 1,000 years old.  Damn. Bye, Don “The Dragon” Wilson. Three things: 1. This really feels like a big loss. Because, OK, James Bond is cool. That’s clear. That’s for sure. But do you know who’s cooler than James Bond? James “The Dragon” Bond. If you’re at a party and you introduce yourself as “Bond, James Bond,” then people are like, “He looks cool.” But if you introduce yourself as “Bond, James ‘The Dragon’ Bond,” that gets respect, my friend. “Did that guy just call himself The Dragon? Oh, fuck. I better not do any super-villainy around him.” 2. Why hasn’t Don “The Dragon” Wilson ever been canonized or deified? He deserves it. If for nothing else, then because HE HAD A MOVIE FRANCHISE CALLED BLOODFIST. And guess who he fought in it. BILLY FUCKING BLANKS. And then guess what. He made SEVEN MORE BLOODFIST MOVIES. Listen to these titles, and I promise you they are real: Bloodfist, Bloodfist II, Bloodfist III: Forced to Fight, Bloodfist IV: Die Trying, Bloodfist V: Human Target, Bloodfist VI: Ground Zero, Bloodfist VII: Manhunt, Bloodfist VIII: Trained to Kill. How? 3. The most recent movie featuring Don “The Dragon” Wilson: an anti-bullying film they actually called The Martial Arts Kid. I super hope they just start firing off a bunch of knockoff titles of other famous movies. Very excited about Bruisesport. And also The Shawshank Redeemer. And don’t forget Scarchest. Remaining Options: David Oyelowo, Tom Hardy, Groot, Sam Worthington, Michael B. Jordan, Channing Tatum, one of the raptors from Jurassic World, Idris Elba, Chris Pratt, Michael Fassbender, Shia LaBeouf, The Rock, Vin Diesel Prerequisite 5: The new James Bond has to be able to open doors without help.  We lose the raptors from Jurassic World here — and Vin Diesel. I’m including him here just because it is very funny to picture Vin Diesel trapped behind a door, trying to figure out how to open it like that alien that got trapped in the pantry in Signs. I feel like that’s gotta happen to Vin two, three, four times a week. Remaining Options: David Oyelowo, Tom Hardy, Groot, Sam Worthington, Michael B. Jordan, Channing Tatum, Idris Elba, Chris Pratt, Michael Fassbender, Shia LaBeouf, The Rock Prerequisite 6: The new James Bond has to be good at outsmarting people.  We’re losing The Rock, Channing Tatum, Chris Pratt, and, sadly, Shia LaBeouf, who was my dark-horse pick and personal preference. The biggest loss here, though, is Idris Elba, who, in a macro view, looks like the obvious choice to play Bond. He’s handsome, he’s well built, he’s European, he has good teeth, all that. But, with the exception of woman seductresses, James Bond generally needs to be the smartest (or most clever) person in any given situation, and Idris just has too many L’s in his history for me to feel comfortable about him being able to outsmart a proper villain. He’s already been outsmarted by, among others, Omar Little and Brother Mouzone in The Wire, zombies in 28 Weeks Later, Frank Lucas in American Gangster, Taraji P. Henson in No Good Deed, and Michael Scott in The Office (truly unforgivable). Sadly, devastatingly, frustratingly — Idris is out. Remaining Options: David Oyelowo, Tom Hardy, Groot, Sam Worthington, Michael B. Jordan, Michael Fassbender Prerequisite 7: The new James Bond has to be able to snatch a life away from someone by any means necessary, and at any time necessary.  This means David Oyelowo is out. He was just way too convincing as Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in Selma. And if you want to say, “Well, sure, but he was obviously evil in Rise of the Planet of the Apes,” then I’d respond, “That’s fair, but if we’re taking him from his Planet of the Apes role, he gets eliminated in the category that preceded this one, given that he was outsmarted by actual chimps and gorillas.” Remaining Options: Tom Hardy, Groot, Sam Worthington, Michael B. Jordan, Michael Fassbender Prerequisite 8: The new James Bond has to have never been in a Terminator movie. Bye, Sam. We’ve still not forgiven you for that, Sam. Can’t wait to see Avatar 2, though, Sam. Remaining Options: Tom Hardy, Groot, Michael B. Jordan, Michael Fassbender Prerequisite 9: The new James Bond has to be able to get to high places in clever ways. Remember the scene at the beginning of Casino Royale in which Bond chased down the parkour guy? Is there any situation at all where you see Tom Hardy doing that? Tom Hardy doesn’t move; Tom Hardy smolders. He’s the closest we’ve ever come to having a person who’s really a volcano and not a human at all. He’s run before, sure. But it wasn’t a James Bond run. Look:  That’s not a James Bond run. That’s an I’m Gonna Murder Your Mother run. That’s an If I Catch You I’m Tearing Your Arms Off run. It’s an ugly run, or maybe a passionate run. Either way, it’s not a James Bond run. A James Bond run is controlled and cool and you gotta stop every once in a while and fix your shirt collar. If Tom Hardy feels compelled to run, his penis could flop out of his shorts and he wouldn’t stop. Love you so much, Tom, but you’re out. Remaining Options: Groot, Michael B. Jordan, Michael Fassbender Prerequisite 10: The new James Bond has to not look like a psychopath. Have you ever looked at Michael Fassbender before? I mean, REALLY looked at him? He looks all the way insane.  James Bond should look cool when he’s not smiling, not like he’s cooking his mother in a large pot at home right now. Fassbender is out. Remaining Options: Groot, Michael B. Jordan Prerequisite: The new James Bond has to be indestructible.  No Bond has ever died. Did you know that? I didn’t know that. In total, James Bond has killed more than 350 people. But he’s never been got. No deaths; not one single time. He can be hurt, he can be tortured, he can getsoclose to dying. But that’s it. That means we need a James Bond who, at the very least, can’t be killed by bullets. And only one of our final two options isn’t impervious to bullets. R.I.P. Wallace. R.I.P. Michael B. Jordan. Congratulations to Groot. Groot is your new James Bond.",2015-10-09T11:28:07+00:00,Movies,Serrano
152,"On Sadness, Family, and the Parenting Lessons of ‘Inside Out’","This weekend, my wife and I took our three sons — 8-year-old twins and their 2-year-old brother — to see Inside Out, which had been described to me by a woman whose taste I semi-trust as being “funny but also sad.” After we watched it, I felt conflicted, because “funny but also sad” is a worthwhile summation of Inside Out, but it’s only partially correct. It’s a good sad, a revelatory sad, not a debilitating sad, and so it’s really not sad at all. The premise of Inside Out is that people have five main emotions in their heads (joy, sadness, anger, disgust, and fear), and in the movie those emotions are characters (their names are literally Joy, Sadness, Anger, Disgust, and Fear) who influence the behavior of an 11-year-old girl named Riley by clicking buttons and moving levers on a control center inside her brain. She does typical things in real life — argues with a friend, plays hockey, talks to her parents — but all the nonevents are turned into gargantuan moments because we get to peek inside her head and see how they’re all being processed and understood. If that sounds terrible, then that just means I did a bad job of explaining it, because it really is a smart and enjoyable and well-executed idea. So much so, in fact, that there is real credence to the argument that Inside Out is the best Pixar1 movie ever, and if it’s not the overall best it’s for sure the most profound.2 Pixar has a strong history of dealing with sadness in its movies. It’s very good at creating this feeling organically. Up was sad, but it was the type of sad established as an obstacle to be overcome. The scene in Toy Story 3 when the toys are riding toward the incinerator was some very true and real existential dread. And the part at the very end when Andy gives away Woody and Buzz and the rest of the toys to the little girl was sad, too, but it was the sadness of closure, which is secretly happiness. Wall-E did the same sort of thing, except in reverse. With Inside Out, though, it’s this new thing: The film presents the idea that sadness is natural and necessary and doesn’t have to explicitly equal unhappiness, which is a powerful notion for a kid, or even a parent, to consider. It’s also the thing that I’ve been thinking about the most since I watched it with my kids. The most important scene for me in Inside Out is when one character gets very sad because he’s lost something that meant a lot to him. Joy’s instinct tells her to try to cheer him up, to distract him with silliness. She makes goofy faces at him, tries to tickle him, says things like, “We can fix this,” and, “It’s gonna be OK.” It doesn’t work. Sadness walks up to him, sits down, acknowledges his loss (“I’m sorry they took … ”), expresses understanding (“They took something that you loved”), listens to him talk about it for a moment, then puts her hand on him and very softly says, “Yeah, it’s sad.” He stops, looks at her, hugs her, cries some, then says, “I’m OK now,” and they get up and move on their way. Maybe it’s a bit obvious, but it’s also moving. I’m generally terrible at this sort of thing. When I see one of my sons crying, the first thing I say nearly every time is something close to, “Stop all that crying, boy.” It is a truly involuntary response. I know that. I KNOW that. It’s something I’m aware of, but it still happens. I suspect that’s why I liked Inside Out so much. The day after we’d gone to the movies, I asked my wife if she’d learned any lessons about parenting by watching Inside Out. She said, “Not really. Not anything I didn’t know. Kids are complicated. They have a lot going on in their heads. Sometimes you just have to let them be. Sometimes you just have to listen to them.” She asked me the same question and I told her the same thing she said, even though I definitely didn’t realize that until after she’d said it. I’m always the least smart adult in the house. I asked the 2-year-old if he’d liked the movie. He said “Yeth,” because he has a baby lisp. I asked what his favorite part was and he pretended to punch me and then ran away. I still understand him. I pulled each of the twins aside and asked them about the movie. I reminded them of how there were “core memories” that were especially important to Riley, memories that shaped the type of person she was. I asked Boy A if he had any of those, things he thinks about that make him feel very happy or sad. He said he really likes that we go out every Friday night as a family to eat dinner at this neighborhood pizza place. I asked him if he could remember a time when he felt like one of the other main emotions was the one controlling him. He said, “Yes, sir. The time I had to jump out of the treehouse because there was a lizard inside I was being controlled by Fear.” The treehouse is 6 feet off the ground. He literally dove out the side of it when a lizard crawled inside. I told him that when that happened, Laughter was in control of me because it was for real the funniest shit. I asked Boy B the core memories question, and he said that his biggest memory is the time his brother taught him how to climb the wall at the front of our house. I told him that it probably wasn’t safe for him to climb it because there are loose bricks on it. He said, “I know, but I’m just answering your question.” Sometimes I’m the least smart child in the house, too.",2015-06-23T14:27:10+00:00,Movies,Serrano
153,"Happy Birthday to Kate Winslet, ‘Titanic’ Murderer Still at Large","Kate Winslet turns 40 today. A good birthday present, since I hardly know her, is to just say happy birthday and wish her a good day, so let’s start with that: “Happy birthday, Kate. I hope you have a good day.” Also, another good present is to expose her for the murderer she is. Let’s do that, too. To be clear, I’m not accusing the real Kate Winslet of being a murderer. That hardly seems like the case. She seems like she’d be quite lovely and agreeable in person. Whom I actually mean to accuse is Rose DeWitt Bukater, her character from 1997’s Titanic. Rose is the murderer. Much has been made about how Jack (played by Leonardo DiCaprio), her love interest in the movie, also could have fit onto that piece of wood she floated on to keep her body out of the freezing water after the ship sank. (The MythBusters guys even did a whole thing on it.) But that’s not what I’m talking about. What I’m talking about happens well before then. What I’m talking about is how that part with the floating wood never should have even happened. Here’s a light recap of Titanic: Rose is from a wealthy family (though their wealth, we learn, is little more than an illusion). She is engaged to Cal Hockley, played by Billy Zane’s eyebrows and hair. He is heir to a legitimate fortune. Leo’s Jack is a poor, handsome artist. All three are passengers on the Titanic. Jack rescues Rose one night after she decides she wants to kill herself by jumping off the ship because she doesn’t want to be engaged or rich, which is absurd. Jack and Rose insta-fall in love with each other. The ship crashes into an iceberg. The ship starts to sink. The ship sinks. Rose and Jack try to survive. Rose survives. Jack doesn’t. But the thing of it is: Jack’s death is entirely Rose’s fault, and, had Jack not been so wily and resourceful, he’d have died a number of times before he had the chance to freeze to death, too. At the two-hour-and-16-minute mark of the movie, that’s where this all starts. This is the scene:  By this point, the ship has begun to sink and the crew is loading the women and children into the lifeboats, and there aren’t nearly enough to hold all the passengers on the Titanic. Rose has managed to get a seat in one, but she hesitates taking it because she wants to stay with Jack. He tells her to go, that he’s a survivor, that he’ll be fine. And Cal joins in, too, encouraging her to get on the boat, because he still thinks he can win her heart later. Cal tells her that he and Jack will be fine because he’s made an arrangement with a crewman on the other side of the Titanic to save them both spots on a different rescue boat. Rose agrees to get on her boat. But she doesn’t stay on the rescue boat. She jumps back onto the Titanic. And had she just stayed there, it’s very likely that Jack never would’ve died. Because every good or smart thing that happens between her getting off the rescue boat and her floating on that big piece of wood at the end of the movie is his idea, and he could’ve just taken her place on the piece of wood. So he spends the rest of the movie trying to keep her alive and also trying to keep himself alive, an impossible task, really, given the circumstances. This is what happens after Rose decides to stay with Jack: That’s 19 times in 39 minutes that Jack did or said something that helped keep them alive. Or, to be more direct: That’s 19 times in 39 minutes that Jack did or said something that stopped Rose from causing him to die. All because she got off that first rescue boat.1 At the end of Titanic, Rose — by then a very old woman — has a group of modern-day explorers around her and she’s telling them her and Jack’s story. One of the guys mentions how there were no records of Jack on the boat, and she says of course there weren’t, because he won his ticket in a poker game and was never officially registered. “But now you know there was a man named Jack Dawson,” she says, her voice crumbling in the wind like desert-dry parchment paper. “And that he saved me, in every way that a person can be saved.” It’s maybe a more literal sentence than she intended. Rose killed Jack Dawson. It took her 20 tries, but she got it done. Rose is a murderer. Happy birthday, Kate. Paramount",2015-10-05T12:08:12+00:00,Movies,Serrano
154,Videocracy: The Many Transgressions of the 2015 MTV Video Music Awards,"The 240th MTV Video Music Awards happened last night. The show has changed a bunch since that first airing in 1776, back when those 13 colonies declared their independence from Britain and then Madonna performed “Like a Virgin” and Abraham Lincoln won Best Hip-Hop video for his tendentious “A House Divided,” featuring Kendrick Lamar. Super racist things are still happening, but women are allowed to enter the workforce now, so I suppose that’s at least one good thing. Miley Cyrus was the host last night, a sentence I feel silly even typing because you for sure already knew that. Other things you likely already know: Kanye West accepted the Video Vanguard award, which is probably the only award of the show that matters outside of the show. In doing so, he announced his intention to run for president in 2020 — the only part of his speech that anyone seemed to care about because people are dumb. Taylor Swift won things because that’s what Taylor Swift does because Taylor Swift is fucking undefeatable in an awards show setting. Nicki Minaj was marginalized because that’s what they do to Nicki Minaj. And some other background people were there doing other background people things. Some notes from the show: Last place (11-way tie). The silver thing; the thing with the flower jacket; the thing with the little white balls on it; the thing that was two eyes and a pair of lips; the see-through thing with the bubbles on it; the shiny pink pants thing; the silver bathing suit thing; the giant postcard thing; the thing with what looked like a bunch of little mirrors on it; the bedazzled one-legged thing; the thing that had the inflatable “Do It” on it. Miley Cyrus as a presentation is like all of the ideas that Lady Gaga decided weren’t clever enough to be interesting, except mushed into a person. Third runner-up: She “accidentally” showed her nipple on TV, although it seemed to be an “accident” like how Anthony Mason used to “accidentally” flagrantly foul someone or like how you “accidentally” cheat on your significant other. Second runner-up: She tried to tell a joke. First runner-up: She wore fake white dreads. The only time the right answer to a question asked of a white person is “Dreadlocks” is if someone asks, “What’s the worst thing you could put on the top of your head, white person?” I’m not sure if fake white dreads are more offensive than real white dreads, but I do know that they are both way up on the FOH scale, losing out only to … Winner: She called Snoop Dogg her “real mammy.” For real. This goes to whomever the person was who scheduled A$AP Rocky and Twenty One Pilots to perform. Nobody asked for that, man. Nobody. Hi, Jared Leto. You’re looking extra creepy tonight, Jared Leto. I hope you have a nice night after you crawl back into your sex cave, Jared Leto. A young person gets famous. Then more famous. Then more famous. Then he starts making bad decisions. And more bad decisions. And more bad decisions. And people decide they don’t like him that much anymore. And at first, he’s halfway repentant. But then he decides he’s going to just lean all the way into the villain role. And so he does that. Then he realizes that he wasn’t built for the villain role. And he wants to make a proper comeback. So he does a bunch of stuff to try to build his brand back up. And after he’s done that, his team schedules a performance at an awards show. And he goes out there and does his performance. And then at the end of it he starts crying. Nice try, Justin Bieber.  I liked it better when Chris Brown did it five years ago at the 2010 BET Awards.  (Now, TO BE CLEAR, Chris Brown spent the next couple of years undoing that moment.) (I hope Bieber doesn’t.) (I hope nobody does, actually.) (Nobody’s worse than Chris Brown.) (Not even Justin Bieber.) (Justin Bieber is actually kind of dope.) (Not fake crying Justin Bieber, though.) (Just regular Justin Bieber.) Kendrick Lamar, the most exciting and most talented new rapper of the past half-decade, has been nominated for eight VMAs since 2013. His only outright win happened last night, but it was for Best Art Direction for “Alright,” which they don’t even bother to show on TV because nobody knows (or cares) what it is. The only award he’s won that actually gets shown on TV happened last night, too, though. It was when Taylor Swift won the Video of the Year award for “Bad Blood.” Kendrick has two verses in that song, but is only in 25 seconds of the video. I don’t think it matters if it was real or not. What matters is that it happened, which allowed everyone to get at least a little bit racist on Twitter and Facebook last night, and that’s all anyone really wants to do anyway. I mean, that’s mostly a joke, but it’s a little true. Really, this whole situation is super convoluted and very confusing. Because what Miley did to Nicki to make her upset is essentially the same thing that people do to Miley. When the MTV VMA nominations came out earlier this summer, Nicki Minaj was upset that “Anaconda” was not nominated for Video of the Year. After a bit of buildup, she alluded to how maybe MTV doesn’t value and appreciate women who aren’t built a certain way (she specifically said “slim,” and implied “white”). A bunch of stuff happened on Twitter. Miley Cyrus was asked about the whole situation by the New York Times. And when Miley answered, she cleared away the (very serious) allegations Nicki made, instead focusing on the manner in which they were delivered. She said: “I saw that. I didn’t really get into it. I know there was some beef. I don’t really know. There’s a way to talk to people. … What I read sounded very Nicki Minaj, which, if you know Nicki Minaj, is not too kind. It’s not very polite. I think there’s a way you speak to people with openness and love.” And this is where it gets confusing. What Miley’s doing to Nicki here is just tone policing; taking the ideas Nicki’s talking about and focusing on the way they’re being presented instead. And that’s (basically) the same thing that people do to Miley. I don’t hate Miley Cyrus but I also don’t like Miley Cyrus. She is just there, a figure in the universe; occasionally unavoidable and 80 percent naked a lot of the time. There are of course things that Miley Cyrus does that are wonderful. She has a long reputation of being extra charitable. And her willingness to aggressively campaign for LGBT rights is for sure admirable. There are more and more instances of her doing good things. And I appreciate those things about her. I suspect most people do. But I also suspect that those who don’t appreciate those things about her use her doofy outfits and accelerated clownishness to dismiss her ideas. It’s tone policing, just a different kind. I don’t know, man. Nicki was right.1 I hope she was being serious. They’re both controversial. Miley Cyrus is the worst kind of controversial, which is to say the fabricated kind. Kanye West is controversial as a byproduct of his own mania, which is to say it’s natural, which is to say it’s enjoyable. He gave about a 10-minute speech after he accepted his Video Vanguard award. During it, he explained why he interrupted Taylor Swift at the 2009 VMAs, but really he was explaining why he does all the crazy shit that he does. To distill it down to two main points: Kanye West is smart. Him giving his speech here was for sure the best part of the show. It was the most vulnerable I’ve ever seen him. I’m excited that he’s at this part of his career. The thing that Miley did to Nicki, and that Miley has had done to her, the tone policing thing — that’s Kanye, too. His speech seemed to be the moment when he was able to address it most readily, and most steadily. It was remarkable watching him talk, watching him consider the magnitude of his actions in real time. George W. Bush has said that Kanye saying he didn’t care about black people after Hurricane Katrina in 2005 was the worst moment of his presidency. And then after Kanye had absorbed all of the fallout from his interruption of Taylor at the VMAs in 2009, he talked a few times about how overwhelming that was and how he could empathize with Bush now. Kanye West has always made it easy for people to dislike him away from his music. Last night was the first time I’ve ever seen him step the other direction. It was fascinating.",2015-08-31T14:46:09+00:00,Music,Serrano
155,"‘Hard Knocks: Houston Texans’: The Sadness of Cut Day, the Joy of Vince Wilfork in Overalls and Cowboy Boots","The Houston Texans are the subject of this season’s Hard Knocks, HBO’s wonderful mini-documentary series that follows a professional football team for the weeks leading up to the start of the season. Disclosure: The Houston Texans are going to win the Super Bowl this year. Another disclosure: They’re going undefeated, too. Final disclosure: I root for the Texans. Some things that happened last night in Episode 4: It’s no longer a competition, or if it is, then it’s a competition the way the Seahawks-Broncos Super Bowl was a competition, or the way John Wick vs. Those Guys in the Nightclub was a competition. O’Brien put on a world-class FUCK exhibition in Episode 4, delivering 15.51 variations2 of FUCK to just one from Vrabel. O’Brien was Jordan putting up six 3-pointers in the first half of Game 1 of the ’92 Finals. He was the Predator in the first half of Predator. Coach Vrabel, he stood tall. He was brave and he was fearless and he was determined. He stood on that log and cut a line across his chest in a declaration of war just like Billy did. And he got mowed down just like Billy did, too. O’Brien: 52.5 Vrabel: 26 During a segment about linebacker Kourtnei Brown, the narrator made mention of Brown having been cut by five NFL teams since 2012, with the voice-over saying the phrase “his dreams seemingly just beyond his reach” as they showed a slow-motion shot of Brown diving to tackle a running back, missing him by inches. It was a way better moment than the tricky lead-in they did last week to Brian Cushing vomiting all over the field. HBO HBO I don’t even know. How do you even? What farm is he tending to? I bet it’s got the biggest fucking vegetables and livestock. I super can’t wait for Green Mile 2: Coffey’s Revenge. HBO 1. J.J. Watt shouting, “They can take as many tries as they need, they’re not getting in,” after his defense stopped the offense from scoring from the 2-yard line on four straight attempts. And then after that, digging the knife in further, dismissively asking, “You sure you don’t want some more work on that?” J.J. Watt talking shit will always be captivating. 1a. J.J. Watt eating 600 pounds of barbecue. He went with Vince Wilfork (and another guy who I couldn’t immediately recognize) to Killen’s Barbecue, a place that regularly requires you to wait upward of two hours to be fed, though I suspect Watt and Wilfork (and the other guy) were served much quicker than that. Right before we’re shown Watt and Wilfork at the restaurant, we see them walking around at practice talking about eating barbecue. After they decide to do so, Watt asks Wilfork, “What kind of meat are you getting?” Wilfork, ever the hero, pauses for a bit, then responds, “All of it.” Watt and Wilfork are the best interracial buddy-cop movie that I have ever seen. 1b. J.J. Watt laughing at something Vince Wilfork said. These two are great together. 1c. J.J. Watt talking about having lost his fifth-grade spelling bee. 1d. J.J. Watt breaking down a huddle. 1e. J.J. Watt standing as part of a huddle. 1f. J.J. Watt wiping sweat off his face. 1g. J.J. Watt making a funny face while trying to catch a football. 1h. J.J. Watt drinking a protein shake, then talking about treating his body like how Olympic athletes treat theirs. (This was before he and Wilfork attempted to eat an entire elephant.) 1i. J.J. Watt holding a towel around his neck while giving advice. HBO He’s great. He’s become a legit underdog hero in Houston. When the Texans put him at running back at the end of this past preseason game against the Saints and he broke a 70-plus-yard touchdown run3 the first time he was shown touching the ball, I got at least as many messages about it as I do whenever J.J. Watt does something incredible. He’s going to make the team. He has to. HE HAS TO. Every time they show him, he’s doing something good. It’d be just a totally crushing move if the Hard Knocks people dedicated all this camera time to him, all of this energy to making us all fall in love with him, only for us to see him get his throat slit in the last episode. He has to make the team. HE HAS TO.  With the exception of Charles James II, no player has presented himself as more positive, more likable, more root-for-him-worthy than Uzoma Nwachukwu. In Episode 3, he was the one who oozed charm during an off-day trip to Space Center Houston. In Episode 4, he did the exact same thing, except this time during a fishing trip with fellow wide receiver Travis Labhart. I desperately want for him to make the team. But it feels a lot like he’s going to end up a casualty of numbers — there are 12 receivers trying out for, at most, six available spots. Best-case scenario: Charles James II makes the team and Uzoma makes the team, too. Middle-case scenario: Charles James II makes the team and Uzoma does not make the team and I cry a lot. Worst-case scenario: Neither Charles James II nor Uzoma make the team and I hang myself. Whether Charles James II and Uzoma Nwachukwu make the team is the only plot point I’m concerned with for next week’s final episode, truly. HBO Shortly after Brian Hoyer was named starting quarterback, Ryan Mallett, the person he beat out for the job, missed practice. Mallett blamed missing practice on his phone’s alarm, but that’s (probably) not what actually happened. I’ll tell you what (probably) actually happened. This will be Mallett’s second season in Houston. He’s been here long enough now that he’s become infected with supreme pettiness, which saturates the Houston atmosphere and is a thing that eventually soaks its way into every Houstonian. The only people who were upset that Mallett missed that practice were people who don’t live in Houston and sports-talk radio people, who, as far as I can tell, have jobs where they pretend to be very mad at stuff like that. Nobody in Houston cared. In fact, we all decided we liked him more for doing that. I am a big, big fan of supreme pettiness. One time — this was, like, eight months after I’d moved to Houston — my wife asked me to take her to some fancy restaurant I didn’t want to take her to. I said no. She said it didn’t matter, that I was taking her anyway, and to go get dressed. And so I did. I put on a muscle shirt, a pair of basketball shorts, a fake fur coat, and dress shoes. I understand that that sounds like a lie or an embellishment, but it is 100 percent not. I came out of the room like, “OK, I’m ready to go.” She just looked at me, and she was like, “That’s what you’re wearing?” And I was like, “Yep.” And she said, “Let’s go then.” I’d been in Houston long enough that the pettiness had found its way into me, so that’s why I dressed up like that. But she was born there and had been there for 20 years already before I even met her. She trumped my pettiness with TRUE PETTINESS. She made me sit in that restaurant in those stupid clothes and it didn’t faze her even a tiny amount. The longer you’re here, the more developed your pettiness becomes. Shout-out to you, Ryan Mallett. I hope that after Hoyer messes up a few times and they decide to put you in the game that you for real throw an interception on purpose. You deserve that. You’ve earned that. HBO Episode 4 was the first of two Cut Day episodes, wherein the Texans trim their roster from the original 90-plus players down to 53. The last few minutes showed Coach O’Brien in meeting after meeting, explaining to player after player why he wasn’t going to make the team. The last person brought in, wide receiver Travis Labhart, listened to O’Brien talk, mentioned that he had considered giving up playing football and possibly transitioning into a coaching role, then stood up, shook O’Brien’s hand, and walked out. The cuts themselves are bad enough; watching these guys — most of whom are still in their twenties — be told that they don’t have a job anymore is hard enough. But with Labhart, when he was walking out, when he was walking down the hallway in slow motion, the narrator verbalized the philosophical drama that appeared to be playing out in Labhart’s head. “Imagine your lifelong dream ending,” he said as Labhart walked, staring forward at nothing except heartbreak. “Where do you go?” “Who do you tell?” “How do you begin again?” HBO",2015-09-02T12:35:04+00:00,TV,Serrano
156,Could I Pull Off These Famous Hero-Dad Movie Moments? An Examination,"Today, a movie called No Escape, starring Owen Wilson, Lake Bell, and Pierce Brosnan, opens wide. Here is the entire summary that IMDb has for it: In their new overseas home, an American family soon finds themselves caught in the middle of a coup, and they frantically look for a safe escape in an environment where foreigners are being immediately executed. It sounds like a fun movie, or at least an intense movie. The part that I’m most interested in, though, the part I suspect most people are interested in, is this:  In case you can’t quite make sense of what’s happening, Wilson’s character, Jack Dwyer, is throwing one of his daughters across a gap between buildings. He’s doing so because he and a bunch of other people are trapped on a roof with some psychopaths who are walking around killing everyone. Jack tells his wife, Annie (Bell), that the one chance they have at surviving is jumping from the roof of the building they’re on to the roof of the building next to them. But there’s a problem: Their two daughters aren’t big enough to make the jump themselves, so Jack has to throw them to Annie after she jumps. That’s incredible. And it brings to mind two questions. First, and this one is ultimately less important than the second: In the trailer, the scene cuts out as the little girl is falling toward the second building. I would assume that the toss is successful, that she lands on the other side safely. But let’s say that she didn’t. Let’s say that she came up a few feet short and fell down the 200 or so feet to the ground. (Since we’re pretending, let’s also say that she escapes miraculously unhurt. Let’s say that she lands on a bunch of old mattresses that the hotel the Dwyers were staying at just happened to be throwing out the day before.) Here’s the question: If you’re the other girl, do you still let your dad try to throw you across even though you just watched him fail? She was younger, smaller, and lighter, so it’s not like it’s going to be an easier feat. What do you do? How do you handle that? And if you’re the dad, what do you do? Can you bring yourself to try it again? Second, and this one is the crux of this particular article: A thing that happens whenever I watch movies like this — or when I see any sort of movie where a dad does something, really — is that I’ll ask myself, “If I were in that exact same position, how would it have ended?” I have three sons and a wife, so it’s natural (and reflexive) for me to imagine myself in those situations. What would I do? How would I handle it? Would I be able to survive the biggest earthquake of all time and rescue my daughter like the Rock’s character did in San Andreas? Would I be able to find my children after our family was ripped apart like Ewan McGregor’s character did in The Impossible? Would I be able to convince myself to fly up into the guts of an alien spaceship like Randy Quaid’s character did in Independence Day? Could I do any of that? Could I be a Hero Dad? Could I be …  His Hero Dad moment: He tosses his two daughters over a gap to prevent them from being killed. The likelihood of success if I were in that moment: I’m pretty confident about this. I’m going high. I have a 95 percent chance of success with this one. The building gap looks to be about 15 feet. But also you have to take into account that the building he’s throwing the girls from is one, maybe two stories higher than the one he’s throwing them to, so really he just has to generate enough force to get them to fall that far. The tiniest kid I have weighs 30 pounds. I could throw him 15 feet on a flat surface, no problem. And I’d switch up the throwing style, too. The trick to getting the best distance when tossing a kid is you put your right hand under his butt so he’s sort of sitting on it like a chair. You lean him forward so that his chest is resting on your left hand. And then you just cock back and shot-put him with all your might. I’d do the same thing with the twins. They each weigh 61 pounds, but they’re a light 61 pounds. They’re all arms and legs. Plus, you have to factor in Dad Strength. Every dad is blessed with Dad Strength as soon as his first child is born. It’s a temporary superheroic burst of energy. You can use it on anything. You can use it to lift a car up off someone’s leg or to throw a football down the block or to carry all the grocery bags from the car to the kitchen in one trip. If you add Dad Strength into the equation — man, a 15-foot throw is nothing. The new problem is you have to just be sure not throw a kid all the way over the second building. Pixar Animation His Hero Dad moment: He treks across the ocean to find his son, who’d been kidnapped by a dentist. The likelihood of success if I were in that moment: I’m pretty good in the water. Plus, the most dangerous thing Marlin runs into during his swim is a couple of cartoon sharks who really don’t even want to eat him. I couldn’t beat a shark in real life, but I could definitely beat a cartoon shark who doesn’t want to eat me. There’s a 65 percent chance that I could handle this Hero Dad scenario.  His Hero Dad moment: His daughter goes on a trip to Europe with her friend. They get kidnapped by Albanian human traffickers who intend to sell them to the highest bidder. Bryan flies to Paris, burns the town down looking for her, finds her, brings her home, and then, as if that weren’t enough, gets her one-on-one singing lessons with a pop superstar. The likelihood of success if I were in that moment: Yikes. Zero percent. Is there a number less than zero percent? Because then it’s that number. Bryan kills 31 people while he’s looking for his daughter. I’ve never even booked my own flight before. There’s no way anything happens here other than me just losing my daughter, and probably also losing my own life, too. I don’t even think I’d make it through the phone call Bryan has with his daughter while she’s about to get kidnapped without having a breakdown. And I for sure wouldn’t be steady enough to say all that slick shit to Marko that Bryan did. Best-case scenario is I’d say something like, “If you let my daughter go now, that’ll be the end of it. I will not look for you, I will not pursue you. But if you don’t, I will look for you, I will find you, and I will kill you.” But it’s more likely I’d get too flustered and jumble up my words, or leave some out, and my badass speech would become, “If you let my daughter go now, that’ll be the end of it. I will not look for you, I will not pursue you. But if you don’t, I will look for her, I will find her, and I will kill her. Wait … no. Not her, you. I won’t pursue her, I’ll find you — ah forget it. You know what I mean, dude.” And that’s not very intimidating. You know who I am in Taken? I’m Amanda’s dad. Amanda is the girl Bryan’s daughter went to Europe with, the one Bryan finds already dead about 30 minutes into the movie. Six months would pass, and I’d be eating breakfast with my wife one day and be like, “Whoa. Wait a second. Have you heard from Amanda lately?” And that would be that. No more Amanda. Rest in peace, Amanda.  His Hero Dad moment: He takes a hospital wing hostage in an attempt to get a new heart for his son, who will die if he doesn’t receive one. The likelihood of success if I were in that moment: This one is a 50-50 shot. The movie ends with his son getting a heart, but not because of anything that John does. So on the one hand, John Q. totally misplays the situation. I don’t want to say that what he did was an overreaction, because I don’t think there’s any reaction that can be considered “over” when you’re talking about the response to finding out that your child might die. But even if he’d have done literally nothing after finding out that his son needed a heart, it still would’ve ended the same. Matter of fact, it would’ve ended better, because he wouldn’t have had to go away to prison for a bit like he does for the hostage scenario. So that’s my 50 percent yes. My 50 percent no is I’m just not tough enough or mean enough or even mean-looking enough to successfully take hostages. Nobody’s being taken hostage by a guy who got teary-eyed at the end of The Wedding Singer, you know what I’m saying?  His Hero Dad moment: While out hunting, Caesar’s son, Blue Eyes, ignores his dad’s suggestion to stay put, wanders off, then ends up getting attacked by a bear. The instant Caesar hears the bear’s roar, he flies in, tackles the bear, gets between the bear and his son, then starts flexing on the bear. The likelihood of success if I were in that moment: FOH. I’m not fighting a bear. You know what happens if a bear attacks my son? Then I’m just here telling you a story about a time a bear attacked my son. I’d throw a rock at it. I’d definitely run and go get help. But that’s it. A bear ain’t on the list of animals I’m willing to fight. That list goes: a sheep, a flamingo, a small zebra, a sloth, and that’s pretty much it. Bears run faster than humans, climb better than humans, AND THEY CAN SWIM, TOO. If a bear wants you dead, then a bear gets you dead. The only way I’m fighting a bear — and the only reason that Caesar gets into the fight with bear — is as a Dad Reflex. A Dad Reflex is just like a regular reflex, only about 50 times quicker. Same as Dad Strength, you get the Dad Reflex the instant you become a dad. Most often, dads utilize it to protect their offspring, but it can also be activated for self-preservation, like to dodge an attacker’s knife swipe or to click out of a porn window real fast before someone walks past your computer. A Dad Reflex is the closest anyone will ever come to seeing the future. Hyundai actually made a whole commercial about it, which is ironic because Hyundais are last place on the Dad Cars list. Caesar’s Dad Reflex is very strong. Dad Reflex is a good thing because it’s a protection-inspired action, but sometimes it’s a bad thing because before you know it you’re wrestling a goddamn bear, which is what happened with Caesar. You can tell because if you watch the clip you can see that after the bear tosses Caesar off him, Caesar stands up, realizes he’s looking at a bear, goes, “Oh, shit,” then immediately starts shouting for Koba to come help him. Poor Caesar was in flight before he knew what he was doing. Zero percent chance this ends successfully for my son and me.  His Hero Dad moment: He takes a jet and goes to rescue his daughter, Dana, who’s been kidnapped by terrorists. He gets into a fistfight with the main terrorist while still flying the jet. Eventually the terrorist loses his balance, rolls off the wing of the jet, then gets ensnared on one of the jet’s missiles. Tasker then shoots the missile (with the guy still caught on it) through a hole in a building and hits a helicopter full of other terrorists. The likelihood of success if I were in that moment: This is going to surprise you, but I’m going 75 percent chance of success here. That’d seem ridiculous, but if you go piece by piece over the scene, it’s actually not that far-fetched. Look: If you swap me out with Dana, then I’m going to die. I’d never be able to stay balanced on the nose of a jet. Swap me out with Tasker, though, and I’m 75 percent sure we’re both getting home OK.  His Hero Dad moment: I’m going to list two moments here. First, he finds out that A.J. and his daughter are dating (and in love) and he’s so surprised that he takes a shotgun and shoots at A.J. a few times (it’s clear he doesn’t really want to hit him). Second, when they’re in outer space and it’s been determined that A.J. is the one who has to stay back to detonate the nuclear bomb to destroy the asteroid that’s going to crash into earth, he walks A.J. down to the asteroid’s surface, then yanks out his oxygen tube, shoves him back into the space ship’s loading dock, locks the door, then takes his place. He does so for the long-term happiness of his daughter. The likelihood of success if I were in that moment: For the shotgun thing, I’m going high. I’ll say there’s a 70 percent chance that that situation plays out the same. The only reason I’m 30 percent hesitant is because I don’t want to accidentally shoot a loved one in the chest and then go to prison for the rest of my life, because that’s what usually happens. For the self-sacrifice thing, I’m going even higher: 90 percent chance of success, though, to be clear, it’d be for entirely selfish reasons. If there’s any opportunity to be the guy who literally saves the world from annihilation, and it’s in as fantastic a fashion as detonating a nuclear bomb inside an asteroid while I’m still on the asteroid, then I just don’t see how you can say no to that. “Killing yourself to save 7 billion people” is the best justification of an action that I can think of, with “punching Kobe Bryant because he’s Kobe Bryant” a very close second, shout-out to Chris Childs. There’s a 10 percent chance I’d chicken out and just ride that asteroid into the earth’s crust, but I’m almost certain I’d be able to click that detonate button.

157,"Straight Outta Compton, Here Comes the World’s Most Dangerous N.W.A Activity Book","The N.W.A movie, Straight Outta Compton, FINALLY is in theaters today. Did you know N.W.A’s Straight Outta Compton was the first album to go platinum without having been played on the radio? That’s a true thing. There was a great big fuss around it, with derision and dismay aimed at its violence and misogyny, and a great many people spent a great deal of time talking about how nobody should be talking about the album. And so, of course, it just grew more and more popular as it grew more and more infamous. N.W.A recorded it in less than two months, spent about $8,000 to make it, fought to get it released and distributed when nobody but, like, six people thought it should go out, and it ended up selling millions and millions and millions of copies and altering the path of rap music (and all of popular culture, if we can take a wide-angle view here) with its massive gravity. It’s a fascinating story, really, with a big number of plot points and an even bigger number of secondary effects, which is why it’s a movie now, I suspect. But this is not an article about the group or the movie. This is just to quickly prep you for the pages below, because down there is the World’s Most Dangerous Activity Book, based on N.W.A. It has a maze, Rap Libs, and more stuff. There’s even an N.W.A word search. Fun! Print out the pages. Fill them in. Color them. Listen to this while you do.

158,Ranking the Fictional Exorcists of Film History,"“You know the interesting thing about skeptics is that we’re always looking for proof. Question is: What on earth would we do if we found it?” — Father Lucas Trevant, The Rite, 2011 The Vatican Tapes, a movie about demonic possession, is going to be playing in theaters this weekend, which got me thinking about a very important, practical question: If I were possessed by a demon, who is the person I’d want performing the exorcism? I have never been possessed, and also do not know anyone who is currently, or was at some point, possessed. That means my experience in this particular field is limited only to things I have read in print and things I have seen in movies. So when answering this question I can only pick from people who I’ve seen perform exorcisms in movies. When deciding whom to pick, the first thing that needs to be established is what makes for a successful exorcism and what makes for an unsuccessful exorcism. The answer here would be obvious: The exorcism that extinguishes evil, that banishes the demon back to where it came from, is a successful one, and the one that does not is not. That’s easy.1 But exorcism movies often end the same way: with evil gone. So, how do we determine which was MORE successful? An exorcism is a battle of biblical proportions and fallout. The casualties associated with a particular exorcism are negligible, so long as the demon is prevented from spreading evil. That’s what’s important. If a little girl or a priest has to die in order to limit the Devil’s reach, then so be it. In fact, we invite it. Self-sacrifice is an essential trope in these films. And yet, deaths definitely matter when measuring exorcisms against each other. How can they not? If you have two exorcisms and they both end with the demon being exorcised but in Exorcism A two people die and in Exorcism B no people die, then Exorcism B was clearly the more successful exorcism. A single human life is minuscule when measured up against the fate of the entire planet, but I am a single human life, as is everyone I love and care about. So, I’m going to choose the exorcist who has a history of being able to do his or her job without letting Satan eat the spirit of anyone who happens to be around while it happens. With that in mind:  Movie: The Devil Inside Exorcists: Father Ben Rawlings and Father David Keane These two dolts. In The Devil Inside, a woman named Isabella is making a documentary about exorcisms. She’s particularly interested in them because her mother was said to have been possessed 20 years prior and killed three people during the exorcism they tried to perform on her. While filming, Isabella meets Father Ben and Father David. They allow her to tag along to an exorcism they’re performing on a separate person. They do so, and it seems successful, but turns out it super was not. A demon, presumably the same one, takes over Father David’s body. He tries to kill a baby during a baptism, and then later puts a gun in his mouth and shoots himself. The demon hops over to Isabella. Terrible things happen. Father Ben tries to get it out of her as they take off in a speeding car. The demon hops out of Isabella and inside of the driver of the vehicle, who spins into oncoming traffic. So that’s four people dead, a baby nearly drowned, and whoever happened to be in the car that they hit is probably dead, too. So, no. Nope. No. Not these two. I don’t understand how anybody with any sort of training is as bad at anything as these two are at exorcisms. When I get possessed, keep these two all the way TF away from me. Let me just work that out by myself. Or send in LITERALLY ANYBODY ELSE. Send in a balloon on a string with a face drawn on it. It’s going to do a better job exorcising a demon from my corpus than Father Ben.  Movie: The Last Exorcism Exorcist: Reverend Cotton Marcus Reverend Marcus, a faithless minister who seems to specialize in performing exorcisms on people who aren’t really possessed, meets a farmer’s daughter who’s said to be possessed. He figures out that she’s not actually possessed when she offers him “a blowing job” instead of “a blow job,” a mistake a demon would never make because demons are very into fellatio, I guess. Turns out, the girl is just having a psychotic break because her mother died and also her brother joined a cult after their mother’s death and the leader of the cult (or perhaps someone or something else) got her pregnant (OR SOMETHING). But guess what: Marcus realizes she WAS possessed after he and his crew stumble across her giving birth to a demon baby in the woods during a cult assembly (OR SOMETHING). It’s a goofy, confusing, clumsy ending. The two people Reverend Marcus was with definitely die and Marcus probably dies, too (we last see him running toward the cult holding his cross). The cult wins. The Devil wins. The demon baby gets thrown into a bonfire. It’s all bad. A common trope in these movies is that the person who ends up performing the exorcism is a person whose faith is wavering, and I get that. Reverend Marcus was just a little too skeptical for my liking. He’s the Reality Bites Ethan Hawke of religious figures. Keep him far from me.  Movie: The Exorcism of Emily Rose Exorcist: Father Richard Moore The wild thing about The Exorcism of Emily Rose is that it’s (loosely) based on a real and true story, and that’s not to say that her being possessed by demons was true, but that an exorcism definitely took place. It happened in Germany over a 10-month period from 1975 to 1976. The woman, Anneliese Michel, had a history of mental illness. Her parents contacted the Catholic Church and asked them to perform an exorcism on her because they believed she wasn’t suffering from mental illness, but from demons in her bones. Michel had exorcism rites performed on her one to two times a week, each one lasting hours and hours, for those 10 months. She eventually died from malnutrition and dehydration. Her parents and two priests were convicted of negligent homicide. Emily Rose follows basically this exact plot, though it very much argues that she was, in fact, possessed (by SIX demons, no less, one of which was Lucifer himself). She dies in the movie, and I don’t want to die during my possession, but no babies get cooked, so I guess if I had to choose between this and that then you should call this guy before you call Reverend Marcus.  Movie: Scary Movie 2 Exorcists: Father McFeely and Father Harris The opening of Scary Movie 2 is a very doofy re-creation of the end of The Exorcist. The only thing sensible in it is Father McFeely’s first reaction when he walks in and sees the possessed girl (he says, “Oh, fuck this,” and then tries to leave). McFeely (played by James Woods) and Harris (Andy Richter) end up vomiting on each other and also on the girl, McFeely tries to have sex with the girl,2 and then it ends with McFeely getting frustrated with her saying bad things about his mother and so he shoots her and kills her. I’m not that excited about having sex with James Woods, but it’s followed by a quick death and that’s preferable to the way it turned out for the first three picks on this list.  Movie: The Conjuring Exorcists: Paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren The Conjuring is about a family who moves into a house that once belonged to an accused witch who sacrificed her baby to the Devil, killed herself, and also cursed anyone who would ever move onto her land. In the case of this exorcism, the family is at least a tiny amount to blame. Early in the movie the witch very clearly tells them “I want your family dead,” and I don’t understand how you hear that and are like, “It’s a good idea for us to still live here.” Ed performs the exorcism, saves the woman the witch had possessed, and also manages to keep anyone else from dying. This despite not being a member of the clergy. I’m very disappointed in Fathers Ben, David, Richard, McFeely, and Harris and also Reverend Marcus. The only problem here is Ed maybe didn’t all the way erase the evil (the movie ends with an allusion to future bad things to come, which we now know definitely happened because they made a spinoff and also have a sequel planned, as well), so that’s how he ends up here. He’s ahead of everyone who let the person who was supposed to be saved die, but also below everyone else who saved the person they were supposed to be saving.  Movie: Stigmata Exorcist: Father Andrew Kiernan He literally walked through literal fire, literally, to save his subject. That’s very clutch. He also stopped a guy from strangling her to death. That’s very clutch, too. She lived. He lived. Sunny days. I’m in. I’m in on Father Andrew. I’m in on anyone who puts foot to fire.  Movie: The Rite Exorcist: Father Michael Michael was actually only trying to game the system to get a college education when he entered the clergy, but ended up realizing that he held just the right amount of skepticism to make him an optimal exorcist. He gets paired up with Father Lucas, an expert exorcist, and so the two begin working together. On their first case, Father Lucas performs an exorcism on a pregnant girl in a hospital. She ends up dying, her baby ends up dying, and the demon ends up inside Father Lucas, which is the exact opposite of how I’d like for my exorcism to turn out. So I don’t want him. I definitely DO NOT want Father Lucas. He’s terrible for being such an expert. He’s an expert at exorcisms the way Kevin James is an expert at being funny. Instead, send Father Michael to rescue me. He steps in, saves Father Lucas, and doesn’t let anyone else die while doing so. No flash, no flurry, just results.  Movie: Deliver Us From Evil Exorcists: Father Mendoza Here’s what you need to know about Mendoza, and it’s all you need to know: He exorcised a demon FROM A MARINE. Can you even imagine the kind of trouble a demon Marine could get into? I’m afraid of just regular human Marines. I want as little to do with a demon Marine as I can get. Father Mendoza is a good pick.  Movie: Repossessed Exorcist: Father Jebedaiah Mayii Repossessed is a parody of The Exorcist starring Leslie Nielsen. Father Mayii eventually uses rock and roll to defeat the Devil, and I know that sounds ridiculous, but that’s sort of the point. The movie is very dumb, but it accidentally brings up an interesting point. As part of the plot, some people want to televise the exorcism because they see it as a good way to generate a lot of advertising money. That’s a goofy idea, but if we concede to the far-fetched notion that exorcisms are real, why wouldn’t the church decide to feature them prominently? Wouldn’t a televised exorcism be basically the best proof of all that the afterlife exists, that heaven and hell exist, that the Devil is real and so, too, must God be? If you show an exorcism on TV at 5:30 p.m. today, by 5:45 I’ll have PayPal-ed all my money to Joel Osteen and will have thrown away any and all sinful things in my life, I promise you that.  Movie: The Exorcist Exorcists: Father Merrin and Father Karras This is the most famous exorcism movie (and arguably the best, as well). It ends with Father Merrin and Father Karras trying to exorcise the demon Pazuzu out of little adorable Regan. Pazuzu ends up killing Merrin, and then, at the request of Karras, leaves Regan and enters him. Pazuzu tries to get Karras to attack Regan, but Karras fights him off long enough to throw himself out of her second-story window, killing himself and (presumably) quarantining Pazuzu to Karras’s lifeless corpse, where Pazuzu will (presumably) wither away into nothingness. I respect Karras’s dedication here. If I’m trying to save someone’s soul and while I’m doing that my soul gets overtaken with the demon, well, then we’re just all going to die now. That’s just a thing that has to happen. Karras is a good man, a righteous man. He saved Regan and banished the evil and that’s wonderful. But he also let his friend die and also killed himself in the process, and so those are marks against his otherwise very successful exorcism. He beats out every exorcist except one.3  Movie: The Possession Exorcist: Tzadok My A1 pick. My main guy. The unstoppable force. The LeBron of exorcisms. Give me Tzadok. Nearly all possession movies exist inside the Catholic Movie Universe. In The Possession, though, we’re outside that, with a Hasidic Jew named Tzadok battling against Abyzou, a demon who is fond of taking children. Abyzou possesses a little girl named Em, Tzadok stands off against him, and Abyzou jumps inside of her dad, Clyde, at Clyde’s request, which — quick sidebar — I’m fairly confident is a thing he asked for 100 percent not thinking it could actually happen. I mean, I love my kids very much, as most dads do, as Clyde did Em. But if a demon hops inside one … it’s just … look, I have three sons. If one of them becomes good friends with the Devil, I have two more left. That’s fair. That’s a fair trade. It’s not a great thing, but it’s a fair thing, and an honest thing. At any rate, Tzadok exorcises the demon out of Em, then after it jumps into Clyde, Tzadok hits him with a fury-hammer of prayers so hard that Abyzou literally crawls out of Clyde’s mouth and back into the box he’d come from. Nobody dies from the exorcisms. Evil is eradicated. Clyde and Em are closer than ever before. Tzadok is that dude. If I get possessed, you send me Tzadok.",2015-07-24T13:17:38+00:00,Movies,Serrano
159,"Giving You What You Need: ‘Black Rose’ and the Sweet, Crazy Life of Tyrese","Tyrese — singer and rapper and actor and author — has a new album out. It’s called Black Rose. It’s his first solo album in nearly four years and is topping the Billboard charts. It’s also, according to him, the last album of his career. That’s an important thing and it’s also a sad thing, because Tyrese is fun and interesting. Incidentally, “fun and interesting” is the same way people will likely describe Black Rose. I am a fan of Tyrese. I like him. I like him a lot. The thing about writing about Tyrese, though, is that you’re writing about Tyrese, and Tyrese is kind of strange, which means that he occasionally does crazy things. There are little things that are crazy in a silly way, like the time he got a KFC cake for his birthday, and there are bigger things that are crazy in a crazy way, like when he decided it’d be a good idea to build a real Starbucks with real employees in his backyard for himself. There was the time he posted a video of himself in one of those gymnasiums with trampolines for floors and he was doing backflips and front flips and he said he learned how to do them in Watts (but didn’t elaborate) and that he was the “Black Chuck Norris.” There was the time he fired his assistant for packing him an Adidas tracksuit but no Adidas shoes for a trip and Tyrese ended up getting very made fun of online after a picture of him in the tracksuit and dress-up shoes ended up bouncing around the Internet. There was the time Tyrese, Ginuwine, and Tank performed on a morning TV show and Ginuwine seemed like he was under the influence of SOMETHING and Tyrese was upset about it. This one wasn’t his fault, I suppose, but it was still funny, and the video interview the three of them did afterward was even funnier. And, maybe my favorite, there was the time that he painted a picture of Malcolm X baptizing Tupac because he said he had a dream about it. He didn’t say who the three women in the background praying were, but what’s great about Tyrese is there’s a strong chance it’s just three random women, but there’s also a strong chance that it’s TLC. ??? While promoting Black Rose last week, Tyrese posted a video to his Instagram where he sat next to a (presumably) sleeping (presumably) homeless woman and ham-fistedly used her as a prop in a clunky metaphor about people “sleeping” on R&B. A lot of the times when Tyrese is trying to be entertaining, he’s actually entertaining. And sometimes things like this happen. It’s just how it goes. His life is weird. Or it’s amazing. Or it’s perfect. Or it’s imperfect. Or it’s dumb. Or it’s a combination of all five of those things. It’s probably a combination of all five of those things. Tyrese also wrote a self-help book in 2012 that wiggled its way onto the New York Times Best Seller list. It was called Get Out of Your Own Way. The self-help book moment seems like a WTF thing to recount now, and I guess that means maybe it felt like that back when it came out, too. But it wasn’t all that surprising, really. Tyrese regularly posts videos of himself attempting to be inspirational to his Facebook page, which he is very active on, because, again, he is kind of strange. But it’s a thing he does and a thing he appears to enjoy. Sometimes the videos are a handful of seconds long; often times they’re five, 10, 15 minutes long. I’ve watched many of them, although maybe “watched” isn’t the correct word, because mostly I just turn them on and then listen to them while I work on something. Maybe “listen” is the right word, or maybe that’s not the right word, because you don’t really “listen” to them so much as you “experience” them, because they are almost always insane, because, one more time, Tyrese is kind of strange. His very best motivational video was released at the end of 2014. It was 16 minutes and 17 seconds long. It was his advice to single women on how not to alienate themselves from the men pursuing them. The opening two minutes and 25 seconds are nothing short of exemplary, and I want you to understand that I am being 100 percent sincere when I write that. It is True Peak Tyrese footage. He started out by giving his thesis, which was clear and concise and made sense: “Don’t independence your way into loneliness.” Then, in a very Tyresian move, he clarified it, but did so in a way that only made it confusing: “What I mean by that is: It’s not because you’re single and that you’re alone, it’s that you’re lonely.” A thing that happens in these videos is they start out one way, and then they pivot super hard all the way TF off the map. This is him continuing his speech: “It’s like you’re pulling out bug spray. As soon as a man try and flirt with you, talk with you or anything, you’re like [makes a spray noise]. Treatin’ motherfuckers like a mosquito.” This makes sense. I get it. I understand it. We’re back to reinforcing his original point. But then: “And what’s really going on is …” What’s really going on, Tyrese? “… you’re going home …” Ok. “[long pause] …” Talk to me, Tyrese. “… you got a little dog.” What? “He’s a poodle.” WHAT? “And every time you walk in the house this little dog is happy as hell to see you. And we’re being replaced with animals.” :/ Here’s another one, and again, this is all just from the beginning of the video: “As soon as a [DJ] in the club say, ‘All the independent ladies make some noise!’ [makes a yelling noise]” OK, I got it. We’re back to the independent thing. “You’re screaming. And the screams turn into a cry … [goes from fake laughing to fake crying]” Right. I’m still with you, Tyrese. “[long pause]” (The long pause is almost always a blinking red light that he’s about to say something insane.) “[long pause]” I’m ready, Tyrese. Hit me. “… Masturbation.” WHHHAAAAT? I was wrong. I was not ready. I super was not ready. “The little rabbit that’s in your drawer. Helping you to go to sleep every night. That’ll never be a man.” Goddamnit, Tyrese. Goddamnit. I’m going to embed this video below because I want you to know that these are real things and that Tyrese is the realest of all: https://www.facebook.com/tyrese/videos/vb.199633956730875/1157584867602441/?type=2&theater  ??? Tyrese was funny on purpose when he and Taraji P. Henson did a Baby Boy skit while she was supposed to be presenting an award at the 2009 BET Awards:  Baby Boy, directed by John Singleton, was quietly an incredible movie and Tyrese was magnetic in it. He was a near perfect balance of hubris and vulnerability and brashness and insecurity, and I don’t think we can ever talk enough about how impressive it was for him to be able to do that in his first real movie role. He very accurately and acutely acted out the restlessness that comes with being caught somewhere between not wanting the responsibility that comes with being a bad person and also not wanting the responsibility that comes with being a good person. The movie resonated because his performance resonated. Look how happy Taraji and Tyrese made Kanye when they played it out in that BET skit: BET I don’t know that Kanye’s ever been as happy as he was right in that moment. ??? Right near the end of Black Rose, there’s a song called “Gonna Give You What You Need.” It’s the best impression of mid-‘90s Jodeci I’ve heard since mid-‘90s Jodeci. It has those same swirling chimes, that same goopy songwriting, that same ability to avoid being tactful while also avoiding being corny. Early in the album, on a song called “Dumb Shit,” Tyrese flawlessly floats around the edges of apologizing for infidelity, and it’s there that we get the premise for the entire album. (I wish there were a way to scrub the verse from Snoop off this and also scrub off the verse from “Black Ty,” but it’s also pretty great that Tyrese has a nickname for himself when he raps.) “Shame,” three songs after “Dumb Shit,” is all heartbroken charm and very dusty pathos, and I don’t know that Tyrese has sounded more convincing in a song since “Sweet Lady” in 1998. The last track on Black Rose is “I Still Do,” and it’s there that we find the most hopeful version of Tyrese. He spends nearly all of the album talking about how he’s done things wrong to an invisible woman, but here, right now, he wants her to know that he still loves her, that he’s still trying, maybe that he’ll always try, that this is the end but maybe it isn’t, and the symbolism seems pretty clear. Tyrese is wonderful. I will never get enough of his smile or his laugh. He has always seemed sincere and nearly always been likable and consistently hopeful. That Black Rose is a strong album is a reflection of that. There was a video he posted earlier this week in which he walked onto a bus1 wearing headphones and singing to nobody but actually singing to everybody. He was recreating the iconic Coke commercial from 1994 that springboarded him into fame. He was a teenager when he was in that. I can’t believe it was 20 years ago. Maybe he can’t either. If this really is his goodbye album, it’s a delightful send-off.",2015-07-16T14:28:29+00:00,Music,Serrano
160,"NBA Stock Watch: Buy the Bulls, Sell Van Gundy, and Other Bits of Investment Advice","We’re close. Four more days and there will be professional basketball on TV every night. To help pass the time and preview what’s coming next, I’m stealing an idea from Robert Mays from a few years ago — NFL Stock Watch — and using it to take a look around the basketball marketplace. What do the numbers say? Who’s trending in the right direction? Who’s headed for a crash? Do the ladies ever tell you that you look like an optical illusion?  Grab a Red Bull and let’s do this. Yes, there are warning signs. Even Bulls fans are wary of expectations. I talked to my friend Ricky O’Donnell from SB Nation and he gave me several paragraphs of concerns. Among them: Now … let me tell you why it’s time to buy in. The Bulls are about to realize that not every season has to be a death grind and it might make a real difference on the court. They will play fast and get creative on offense. They won’t have to play Noah and Gasol together, because that never really made sense. They can open up the court now. They’re already starting Mirotic at the 4, which clears the way for him to go nuts this season. Off the bench, Taj Gibson’s still there and Bobby Portis looks awesome, which is a fantastic insurance policy. Good things are happening with Fred Hoiberg. It may take a while to find the right rotations, but there’s enough talent to give them some room for error. When that was true in the past, the depth either wasn’t utilized properly or it disappeared because stars were run into the ground and injured. Thibs made it work, but the Bulls were ready for a change. The roster is a nice mix of veterans who aren’t quite washed up yet and young guys who are just about to break out. Don’t worry about the red flags, don’t worry about last season. “Risk” is the market’s way of saying “opportunity, and Jimmy Butler recently removed the rearview mirror on his car because nobody’s looking back anymore. Is this photo of Stan Van Gundy real? Please for the love of everything holy tell me it's real pic.twitter.com/PjnICai382 — Brandon Shaw (@Shawzyy) October 22, 2015  It is not humanly possible to root against Stan Van Gundy. For this reason alone, I want the Pistons to prove everyone wrong. But man — relying on Reggie Jackson would be concerning enough. Relying on Brandon Jennings after an Achilles injury would be concerning enough And pairing them together probably compounds all those concerns. Ersan Ilyasova is here to stretch the floor, a full four years after that one season where everyone thought he was underrated. Stanley Johnson is great, but he’s a rookie, and he’ll probably take a few years before he changes anything. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope has one of the best names in basketball and … that’s really all I can tell you about Kentavious Caldwell-Pope. I don’t know. Danny Granger? The Other Morris Twin? There’s not much to go crazy about beyond Andre Drummond in a Greg Monroe–less universe. And even with more space, Drummond will have to become much better for this team to ever be good. The system is fun and they’ll be competitive, but — and it hurts me to say this — Stan Van is quietly putting together another good case for why coaches shouldn’t also be the GM. The plan here is unclear, either for this year or the next five. Right now, the Pistons are what the Clippers would look like if all they had was DeAndre Jordan.  Don’t talk to me about the Tyreke Evans injury. Get out of here with your “inevitable six-week Jrue Holiday injury” concern-trolling. No matter what happens, the Pelicans deserve to be taken seriously for three reasons. First of all, Anthony Davis is there, and facing him is likely to be even more unfair. Second, it’s not like the Pelicans were healthy last season, and they still won 45 games. The difference between Monty Williams and Alvin Gentry should be worth five or six wins in close games alone. The offense will be supercharged now, particularly as the team slowly realizes how deadly it can get with Brow at the 5. It’s actually the other side of the court that’s most exciting, though. Adding Gentry was a coup on its own, but pairing him with Darren Erman running the defense takes it to a whole different level. Now we get to see what happens when the Brow worships in the Church of Thibs all season. Despite all the tools, Davis wasn’t quite a dominant defender under Monty and the Pelicans could never put together a good defense. That should start to change this season, and when you pair it with an improved offense, this team’s ceiling starts to rise. Along the same lines: It’s not as if the Brow’s ceiling wasn’t already limitless, but one of the most gifted players on earth now has a brilliant offensive coach and an assistant who will help him unleash his full powers on defense. Buy every share of Pelicans stock you can find. Press pause on the Bucks. If you, say, own a truly embarrassing amount of Giannis Antetokounmpo stock, it’s not time to sell. But it may not be time to buy into the future yet, either. The roster is too bewildering to buy into right now. Nobody has any idea what Jabari Parker can do this season. Greg Monroe may fit and help on offense, but they may also miss Zaza Pachulia more than people realize. Michael Carter-Williams as a starter is an experiment that isn’t going to work long-term, and a disjointed season will probably be what it takes to make that obvious. Greivis Vasquez is a fun bench player, but he’s not the answer, either. Nobody can explain why they drafted Rashad Vaughn, nobody knows how the offense will look on any given night, in any given quarter. Having said that, what the Bucks are doing now is putting together a fun team that can compete. That’s cool. And a lot of choices that feel questionable now — Vaughn, Monroe, MCW — will be irrelevant down the line. Whatever happens for the next six months, this team will eventually be a nightmare if Giannis turns into a Space Age Scottie Pippen, and Jabari turns into a Carmelo Anthony sequel next to him. Both of those things are pretty easy to imagine. If not this season, then soon — which feels like it should be the Bucks’ motto. Any remotely objective version of this column would tell you to buy into everything that’s possible in D.C. this season — with John Wall, with Bradley Beal, with Otto Porter, with newly-minted stretch-4 superhero Kris Humphries. Everything David Thorpe says here feels right and all the optimism in the air is genuinely alarming. To be safe, let’s say they’ll lose about six or seven winnable close games and finish with the 4-seed. There’s no way the Pacers will be good enough for Paul George to actually win, but if he really plays a full season at the 4 surrounded by shooters, he can work himself into the MVP conversation. The pieces are all there. For one thing, there are no expectations for the Pacers, so any bit of success will be considered twice as impressive. Likewise, his teammates are average enough to guarantee he stands out in every win, a little like Russell Westbrook last season. Just as important, today’s NBA media takes a special pride in making counterintuitive MVP campaigns, and George on a surprise Pacers team could be perfect. But that last part makes this sound a little less exciting. Instead, let’s just imagine Paul George at the 4 in full Russell Westbrook mode.  If we’re going strictly by the past 30 days, nobody in the NBA has a higher stock price than not-chubby-anymore Kyle Lowry. The Raptors also added DeMarre Carroll, Cory Joseph, and Luis Scola over the summer. Those were solid moves, even if they don’t really change anything about this team’s ceiling. What’s tougher to understand is bringing back Dwane Casey. Didn’t this team quit on Casey last season? Did Masai Ujiri not see the Wizards series? Did he miss Lowry freaking out in huddles and saying the organization had a lot to fix “internally”? Lowry is awesome and the idea of a turbocharged version of him for this season is pretty fun to dream about, but he, DeMar DeRozan, and Carroll can only do so much. Anyway, there’s no team in the NBA that’s tougher to predict. They could finish top four in the East, or they could start slow, things could break bad internally, and it could cost them the season. For now, it’s probably safer to get out while everyone’s talking about Lowry not being fat. Teams can go a long way in the NBA by just having their shit together and playing hard every single night. This is why a relatively forgettable Celtics roster should surprise people this season, and it’s why the Hawks will challenge a barely-paying-attention regular-season Cavs team for the top seed in the East. Betting on Brad Stevens and Coach Bud is not the sexiest stock advice, I know. But money is sexy, right? Just focus on the money. The future gets tricky once you have to decide whether a 30-year-old Al Horford is worth $25 million a year next summer. The rest of the East is getting better, and the Hawks may be left choosing between an older version of this current group or an alternative version of this team that doesn’t have the cornerstone of Horford on both ends of the floor. All the more reason for Hawks fans to enjoy this era while it’s here.  The future is looking GOOD. So by my count, Denver's playing without the following guys: Mudiay, Jameer Nelson, Randy Foye, Wilson Chandler and Joffery Lauvergne — Tony Jones (@Tjonessltrib) October 23, 2015  I had no idea there was an NBA player named “Joffrey Lauvergne” until I saw that tweet. Please keep the Nuggets out of my life. Update from two nights ago: Mario Hezonja: 19 points so far in 18 minutes. — Josh Robbins (@JoshuaBRobbins) October 22, 2015  HEZONJA SEASON. LET’S GET WET.  I would be so willing to stupidly talk myself into Carmelo and the Knicks if Derek Fisher had any idea what he was doing. Instead, this season feels like a ticking clock, counting down to … Toronto? Brooklyn? Phoenix? Any team with a lottery pick? Everything should be on the table. It makes sense for Phil and the Knicks to move in a different direction and it makes sense for Carmelo to be frustrated with the current state of affairs as he plays out the end of his prime. Buy up all the Carmelo-Trade-Rumors SEO advertising you can, and maybe double down with some Woj shares, as well. Nope. YEP. He’s in the final year of his deal and it will make sense for the Mavs to take things in a more tanktastic direction after this season. So … maybe the Cavs, if things don’t work out this season? Lakers? Wizards? Dramatically swoop in to take over for Pop after he wins a title and retires on top? Take a year off? Anything is possible and as we’ve seen in Atlanta, Golden State, and 10 other places, coaches can alter the landscape of conferences almost as much as players can. I’m going to be picking Carlisle destinations all season long. Minnesota??? This week's SI covers: The education of the NBA's next generation begins.

See them all: https://t.co/15REZ2fab3 pic.twitter.com/s7bnQ6ENZ5 — Sports Illustrated (@SInow) October 21, 2015  The Wolves are a year or two away from making any real dent around the league. For now, just enjoy a season of Karl-Anthony Towns and Andrew Wiggins trying to survive both the West and daily life with Kevin Garnett. And no, it’s not exactly going out on a limb to call the no. 1 pick the future rookie of the year, but Emmanuel Mudiay is the current favorite to win, followed by Jahlil Okafor, D’Angelo Russell, and then Towns. Of those four, Towns is probably the best player right now, and he’ll have as much opportunity to shine as any of them. Don’t overthink it. Also, and way more important than any of this, let’s hope Flip Saunders gets better. Look, the idea of paying $82 million for a backup power forward who doesn’t crack 10 points per game is obviously ridiculous. However … let me defend it for a minute. If YOUR team paid Tristan Thompson $82 million, you would do a double take at first, and then you’d keep thinking, and eventually you’d be pretty much fine with it. Soon, you would start talking about how valuable his rebounding is, how versatile he is on defense. And you’d realize that in today’s NBA you can stick him at the 5, play small around him, and build a pretty fun team. You’d point out that he was a monster in the playoffs at 24 years old, and the numbers don’t really do it justice. He was extending possession after possession with tip outs, and holding down the paint on defense, keeping teams off the boards on that end, too. Who cares if he’s overpaid by $10 million? It’s smart to keep good players. The Thunder let James Harden walk because they refused to pay an extra $4.5 million, and look how that turned out. Tristan Thompson’s not Harden, at all, but he’s not Enes Kanter or Reggie Jackson, either. He has real value to a good team. Do the Cavs need him to win the East? No. But he’s a pretty unfair weapon to bring in for 25-30 minutes off the bench — and weapons like that are exactly why LeBron left Miami to go to Cleveland. For the record, I tried to say all that without being That Guy Who Reminds You About The Rising Salary Cap Next Summer. But there will be 15 different contracts next summer that make five years, $82 million for Thompson look GREAT. Keep it going all season. The Warriors did get lucky, even by “all championship teams get a little lucky” standards. They’re probably still the best team in the league and they definitely were last season, but if this makes every matchup with the Thunder, Cavs, and Spurs twice as dramatic, and it keeps the Warriors pissed off for the next nine months, we all win.1 Since this turned into a full-on NBA preview, here is a quick prediction for the East. Here is a prediction for the West: Wikimedia Commons Steph Curry was throwing alley-oops from half court last night and the Warriors were up 40 in the fourth quarter. Kevin Durant shot 20-for-29 for 52 points in his past two preseason games, and he was talking trash to the opposing bench as he did it in Utah. LaMarcus Aldridge is in San Antonio now, Kawhi Leonard is a dark-horse MVP candidate, and the Spurs are the Spurs. The Rockets have Dwight Howard, Ty Lawson, James Harden, and like 18 perfect role players. The Pelicans have Davis, the next Best Player on Earth. The Clippers have one of the three greatest point guards ever running Stockton-and-Malone shit with Blake Griffin, but with 10 times the athleticism, and now 100 percent more Lance Stephenson. The Grizzlies will beat the crap out of those Clippers, and pretty much everyone else, grinding out 50 wins again. Even Utah’s good. Boogie’s great. The Suns play at 120 mph, and the worst team in the conference has two of the best young players in basketball. This is ridiculous. There’s nothing left to say anymore.

161,The Two Ways to Watch the Heat This Season,"Here is one way to preview the 2015-16 Miami Heat: This is the second-best team in the East. It needs a lot to break right to make it to late May, but there’s enough talent here to allow a wide margin of error. Chris Bosh is back, and he’s the linchpin on both ends of the court. Now everything else will click. Goran Dragic will be more comfortable and should be even more lethal. Speaking of lethal, Dwyane Wade’s been cast aside by the NBA so quickly that he’s probably underrated at this point. Hassan Whiteside will be a pain in the ass for any team to deal with. Throw in Josh McRoberts, the perfect floor-stretcher off the bench, next to either Whiteside or Bosh, and then consider Luol Deng adding … well, don’t focus on Deng. Look at Justise Winslow throwing himself all over the court. And there’s Erik Spoelstra, one of the five best coaches in basketball. Even if Wade misses 20 or 30 games, this will be a fun year. Here is another way to preview the 2015-16 Miami Heat: This is a bad idea. Sure, I understand how we got here. There were no better ideas. But the lack of viable alternatives doesn’t make this — relying on a core of four declining superstars, the NBA’s biggest head case, and a rookie — a good idea. Factor in the expectations and the likely frustrations that will ensue when they aren’t met, and this could get uglier than anyone might predict. Did you see how much money they gave Dragic? And Whiteside’s in a contract year? And then they signed AMAR’E? Jesus. Even the optimistic preview has Wade missing 20 or 30 games this year. This has all the makings of a miserable slog to the seventh seed. Is it too late to send Winslow to Boston? So … Lynne Sladky/AP Which version do you trust more? Do you believe in the Heat? I do not believe in the Heat. With all due respect to Pat Riley and his legacy of evil, this is the type of team that Isiah Thomas would build. 2015-16 NBA PreviewEverything you need to know about the coming season.It’s prediction season, so I started mine by putting the Heat with that cluster of teams in the thunderdome for the 2-seed in the East — with the Bulls, Hawks, Wizards, and maybe the Raptors. But there’s just too much working against Miami. There are too many cracks in the foundation to expect this to hold up over five months. This team looked BAD last year, even before the Bosh injury. Even after the Dragic trade. Remember, the teams competing for last season’s Eastern 8-seed were not world-beaters, and Miami wasn’t even in the conversation at the end. It was the Paul George–less Pacers and the Celtics, and Boston won out because (the other) Isaiah Thomas was the most valuable Phoenix Sun traded at the deadline. Granted, getting Bosh back to pair with Dragic — they never played a game together — should help on both ends of the floor. But that won’t solve the fit issues with Dragic and Wade on the perimeter, or the depth issues off the bench. Also, there’s a chance Dragic just isn’t the same player he was two years ago. It’s certain Wade isn’t the player he once was. And Bosh is supposed to fix all of that? Will he make Deng five years younger? Will he add three bench players? Bringing everyone together over the past two years — five years, $118 million for 31-year-old Bosh; one year, $20 million for 33-year-old Wade; five years, $85 million for 29-year-old Dragic — sounded good. But on paper, it looks … a little too Knicks-ish for me. Or maybe 2004 Lakers-ish, except there’s no Kobe or Shaq and everyone is Karl Malone. This was Riley’s plan because it was the only move left on the board. He could either overpay for a bunch of old superstars and try to steal Kevin Durant next summer, or start over with no superstars and no shot at Durant. Of course he went in this direction. Betting big on Whiteside is better than folding the hand altogether. Now, though, there are two ways to watch what happens next. On the one hand, you can treat this team like it’s a budding juggernaut and root for it as a challenger to the Cavs in the playoffs. This would be great, but it probably won’t happen. Wade and Dragic haven’t shown they can win together, Bosh is getting older, and Winslow will take a few years before he transforms into a full-on killer grizzly bear on the wing. For now, it will be dicey. Expecting this team to be a contender will just leave everyone pissed off. So don’t expect this team to be a contender. Look at all of this as a stubborn last stand from a legendary GM, a proud franchise, and two aging franchise players in Bosh and Wade.  Call this a hot take or a gut feeling, but really, it’s just a public service announcement. If you’re hoping to see Riley’s master plan come to life, it’s hard not to notice 10 different ways it won’t work. But if you look at this team as a reckless, glorious mess — Bosh mentoring Whiteside, Dragic and Wade gunning side-by-side and playing completely different styles, Amar’e and McBob popping in off the bench, Deng dragging himself through another 82 games, Winslow looking both overwhelmed and more functional than all of them — the 2015-16 Heat might just win your heart, after all.",2015-10-22T08:36:07+00:00,2015 NBA Preview,Sharp
162,The Warriors Are Angry; Long Live the Angry Warriors,"There’s nothing wrong with being nice. It’s good to be nice. Smile, say the right things. Don’t make enemies. Don’t lose your cool. This is all a good recipe for healthy living, and if you can pull it off every day, more power to you. But of all the people you know who never lose their cool … how many of them are actually cool? Think about all the boring people in your life who you’d describe as nice. Forget being nice. ""I've got my ring fitted for my middle finger""- Bogut on KNBR talking about the Clippers/Rockets hating — warriorsworld (@warriorsworld) October 9, 2015  The Warriors have had enough. Somewhere along the line, it became acceptable to say that Golden State got lucky on the way to the 2015 title. Now it’s gained traction across the league. Doc Rivers told Zach Lowe that the Warriors got lucky avoiding his Clippers and the Spurs. Ty Lawson said Steph Curry didn’t have to play any defense in the playoffs. Kyrie Irving said a healthy Cavs team “definitely” would have won the title. We’ll get to the luck question, but that’s not why I’m writing here today. They won. It doesn’t matter whether they were lucky. What matters is that people are saying it, because now the Warriors are pissed off and talking trash to the entire league, and it’s wonderful. Listen to Klay Thompson: “If we got lucky, look at our record against [the Clippers] last year. I’m pretty sure we smacked them. Didn’t they lose to the Rockets? … That’s funny. Weren’t they up 3-1, too? Tell them I said that, too. I wanted to play the Clippers last year, but they couldn’t handle their business.” This is new. The Warriors were the feel-good story of the NBA last season. They were the nice guys that everyone could root for — the example that parents could show their kids. They were sharing the ball and laughing their way through a 67-win season. Sure, Draymond Green was talking trash on every other possession, but the spirit of the team was about as warm and cuddly as it gets. If Steph Curry wasn’t the star of the playoff run, his then-2-year-old daughter was. A picture truly is worth a thousand words pic.twitter.com/6tVYoWG85I — Golden St. Warriors (@warriors) May 20, 2015  Now? Let’s press pause on the Riley memes so that Harrison Barnes can remind LeBron James who won the NBA title. #TBT ? pic.twitter.com/VrVgf6hRRX — Harrison Barnes (@hbarnes) September 24, 2015  This is good. Your turn, Draymond: If they saying [we got lucky], they aren’t the champs. Gregg Popovich didn’t say that. That’s one organization I really respect. And you haven’t heard anyone in they camp say that. You ain’t heard anybody in OKC say that, some of the organizations I really respect. If they saying that, you the see ring fitting man over there? Jason of Beverley Hills, he over there fitting us for our ring? That’s pretty cool. So if they saying that, it’s some bitterness and some saltiness going around. They obviously not the champs. So who cares what they say. It is what it is. … It’s just bad, man. I would feel bad about myself doing that. It’s just crazy to me, but that just lets you know how many people didn’t want to see us win. Because they sick. People hate change. People don’t accept change well. This is long overdue. You have to understand: People were questioning whether Golden State was a real contender for most of last season, too. Charles Barkley said you couldn’t win a title shooting that many 3s. Everyone worried the Warriors didn’t have enough big men. James Harden was the real MVP, not Steph. Through it all, the players rarely engaged any of the skepticism. They kept it diplomatic in interviews and answered the questions on the court, right up until they won the title. Of course, speaking of that title run, the NBA turned into the Hunger Games as the season unfolded. A new superstar went down every month, and it happened to every team except the Warriors. Against the Grizzlies, Mike Conley wasn’t healthy, and Tony Allen got hurt halfway through the series. Even in the Finals, when Cleveland was giving the Warriors a better series than anyone expected without Kevin Love, Kyrie’s knee gave out, and the series was all but over right then. Meanwhile, they never played the Spurs, and they never played a healthy Thunder. Even the Rockets were working with Dwight Howard on a torn MCL. Were the Warriors lucky? Definitely. Should we be glad that this conversation is going to piss them off all season long? Even more definitely. For example, Curry was pressed for a response to Lawson’s comments about his playoff defense. This is how nice guys respond. Curry on Lawson's ""chilling on defense"" comments: ""It's funny to me. That's my answer."" — Ethan Strauss (@SherwoodStrauss) October 3, 2015  That was how all of last season went. Nice guys take the high road. But eventually, everyone has a breaking point. Even Steph. Sarcastic Stephen Curry: ""I just want to say, 'I apologize for us being healthy. I apologize for us playing who's in front of us.'"" — Diamond Leung (@diamond83) October 13, 2015  Sarcastic Stephen Curry: ""I apologize for all the accolades we've received as a team and individually. I'm very, truly sorry."" — Diamond Leung (@diamond83) October 13, 2015  You may think all these quotes are just responses to the Clippers and Rockets, but I’m not so sure. The Warriors unleashed fury on the NBA last season — statistically, one of the most impressive seasons of all time — and now people all over the league and the media are whispering about luck and putting an asterisk next to what happened. Most NBA champions spend the preseason taking victory laps, talking about how committed they are, and re-living last season’s glory. The Warriors aren’t acting like a defending champion because they’re not being treated like one. Maybe this is what it looks like when a young team wins a title and refuses to play it cool. Maybe this is all happening because Steve Kerr is currently taking a leave of absence to nurse a back injury, and the players are loosening up a little bit. Or maybe the Warriors were luckier than everyone last season, and also better than anyone, but four months later the NBA’s only acknowledging half that equation. Whatever the origins may be, I support every second of this. I swear to God, we’re 48 hours away from Riley Curry talking shit about Lil Chris. Keep the Warriors pissed off forever. They’re more interesting this way. They’re more fun to root for. And the idea of watching an angry version of last season’s 67-win juggernaut is the only thing in the world that could make me more excited about the Western Conference this season. In the meantime, in other news, Klay Thompson made headlines this weekend when his Instagram model girlfriend broke up with him and publicly accused him of cheating. On the one hand, cheating on your girlfriend is not cool. On the other hand, neither is dating an Instagram model. Let’s call that a break-even situation for Klay. Oh, and what’s that?

163,Tell Your Grandkids About the 2015 Buffalo Bills,"Most pro sports teams are smart these days, or at least they try to be. Everyone follows the same Moneyball-ish blueprint, trying to exploit the same market inefficiencies. Most teams are risk-averse as a rule. It’s like a race to see who can be most responsible. But what if I told you that there was one team that refused to play by the rules? What if there were a team built on questionable logic and bad decisions? What if I took you to the edge of the cliff in the Smart Sports era and told you that not everyone jumps? Some teams try to fly.  Nobody pays star running backs anymore. That’s like rule no. 1 for modern football. LeSean McCoy was brought to Buffalo via trade, and immediately signed a $40 million deal with $26.5 million guaranteed. The first headline he generated as a Bill was when he tried to host a Females Only party at a club that was “no big orgy or anything,” but did require that all guests sign a confidentiality agreement. Six months earlier, Rex Ryan had become head coach in Buffalo, and promised to “build a bully.” After signing Richie Incognito, he clarified that he meant a bully on the field, and on the field only. Six months later, the Bills currently lead the league in penalties, and they’re on pace to set an NFL record. The Bills have a combined 13 unnecessary roughness, unsportsmanlike conduct or taunting penalties. No other team has more than 6 such flags. — Mike Rodak (@mikerodak) October 5, 2015  Last Sunday, Rex saw his team’s 17 penalties against the Giants and said he’ll take a team that can fight over a team that won’t. Later in the week, he admitted that the penalties could be a problem, long term. Now they’re doing teamwide pushups after every penalty in practice. I don’t want to curse this Bills team with expectations. They might make the playoffs, they might not. They won’t win the Super Bowl. They’ll probably get destroyed by New England again later this year. But none of that matters. Win or lose, the 2015 Bills are perfect. I’ll tell my kids about this team. And then one day I’ll tell their kids about this team. This is basically a Madden roster come to life. I don’t say that lightly, either. It’s become pretty common to say that Player X or Team Y is “like a video game,” but Tyrod Taylor is literally the exact quarterback I would trade for if were still 16 years old and playing Madden all year. You can get him for nothing, and he may not be good in real life, but he’s fast enough to dominate video games regardless. If you think this is just a tired cliché, please get out of my face right now; I won a Super Bowl with Marques Tuiasosopo. Tyrod is the prototype.  He had a great career at Virginia Tech, but at no point did anyone watch him play and say, “Wow, can’t wait to see what he does in the NFL.” He was the standard-issue good college quarterback who disappears into the ether — until now.  The receivers are Sammy Watkins and Percy Harvin, two of the fastest players in the league. Buffalo baffled everyone by trading two first-round picks to draft Watkins in the top five. Harvin arrived after stops in Seattle, where he got into a fistfight with teammates, and New York, where he played the final eight weeks of last season, which is when Rex Ryan took a liking to him. Both perfect Bills origin stories. I don’t want to get too deep with the Madden analogy, but come on: LeSean McCoy is the closest thing the NFL has to a living, breathing L2 button. Karlos Williams is the truck stick. Richie Incognito is the textbook veteran with a mid-80s rating who’s inexplicably available for cheap at the top of the free-agent list. Even the team itself is a perfect choice for franchise mode. Who doesn’t want to take the Bills all the way and/or screw around with their (quietly great) uniform choices? Also, SNOW GAMES. There are other players worth loving across the roster. IK Enemkpali broke Geno Smith’s jaw in August, got waived later that day, and was immediately signed by the Bills. Seantrel Henderson is the former no. 1 recruit in America who flamed out at Miami, only to get picked as a seventh-rounder and immediately carve out a career starting at tackle. Charles Clay was a sixth-round pick from Tulsa, and now he’s one of the better playmaking tight ends in the league. And then, obviously, there’s Chris Hogan. Remember? “Chris Hogan always open”? 7-Eleven? He was the star of Hard Knocks a few years ago with the Dolphins after Reggie Bush and others gave him the nickname “7-Eleven” because he’s always open. He played four years of college lacrosse at Penn State before doing a post-grad year playing football at Monmouth. And, possibly because of his good looks, he was easily my fiancée’s favorite character in the history of Hard Knocks. I told her he’s the stereotypical feel-good story who eventually gets cut to break your heart at the end, and that’s what happened, AND THEN HE RESURFACED AS BUFFALO’S MUCH COOLER VERSION OF WES WELKER. Photo by Rob Foldy/Getty Images Almost every big name on this roster was either acquired for way too much or cast aside by the rest of the NFL. When the Bills hired Rex Ryan, he almost satisfied both criteria. The Bills already had a good defense. They needed offense — the one thing the rest of the league agreed was beyond Rex’s purview. Then we found out they were coming into camp with a quarterback battle between EJ Manuel and Taylor? And McCoy was supposed to change everything? It was a disaster in the making. It still might be, sure. It seems like McCoy might pull a hamstring every other week. Watkins is nursing an injury of his own, and Williams has already been hurt twice. But however it plays out, just respect what’s happening here. Rex’s blend of optimism, arrogance, and weepy nostalgia personifies the fans perfectly, and it’s why both are great. The team itself is closer to Taylor. There are a lot of intriguing tools, but even after some early success, it’s fair to wonder whether any of this is sustainable. Even last week, it became clear that expectations were getting out of control and a letdown was likely. I was at the game when that happened last year, too. Now they’re 2-2. On Sunday, they’re on the road against the Titans, and next week, they get the currently undefeated Bengals at home. The roller coaster of emotion will probably continue all year, and it’ll end with a game against the Jets that could mean everything or nothing at all. Then, one day, years from now, someone will ask, “Remember that Bills team that was rocking out with Sammy Watkins, Percy Harvin, Tyrod Taylor, Rex Ryan, and LeSean McCoy?” Yes, yes I will. Next to 25 teams trying to imitate the Seahawks and Patriots, this is different.",2015-10-09T13:36:21+00:00,NFL,Sharp
164,Answering Some Questions About Paul George Playing Power Forward,"Paul George is back starting for the Pacers this season, but the Pacers will look very different in 2015-16, and it starts with Paul George. That alone is reason enough to pay attention. But as NBA training camps begin this week, we’re watching two parallel story lines in Indianapolis. First, the Pacers brain trust is very excited about going small this season and playing faster with George at the 4. Second, are we sure Paul George wants to play the 4? You may have more questions about this. That’s natural. Let’s take it from the beginning. Is Paul George really going to play power forward this season? Yes. How much power forward will Paul George play? Depends on whom you ask. Over the summer, George said, “It’s not going to be logging 30 minutes at the power forward. Whatever needs to be done. If I’ve got to play a couple of minutes at the power forward, I’m fine with it.” Then, 48 hours later, Larry Bird chimed in: “He don’t make the decisions around here.” OK then. Bird would go on to say in July: “I just think offensively it’s going to be one of the greatest feelings he’s ever had. I’m not going to get in a battle with Paul George on where he wants to play. He’s a basketball player. He can play any position you put him out there.” When did this idea start? As Dan Devine noted at Ball Don’t Lie, changes were afoot as soon as last season ended. As Bird put it in his end-of-year press conference, “There’s a gentleman who sits behind me who said, ‘Boy, I wish they’d push the ball up a little faster.’ And I agreed with him.” Frank Vogel explained that the switch’s origins go deeper than that guy who sits behind Bird. “This all … began a couple of years ago with what Miami did. They basically saw two elite offensive players in [Dwyane] Wade and [LeBron] James and said, let’s give these guys offensive space,” he told ESPN Radio’s Dan Dakich. “Let’s open up, let’s take the bigs out, let’s make [Chris] Bosh a 3-point shooter whether he’s at the 4 or the 5, and at times play with five 3-point shooters out there … It’s very difficult to guard.” Indeed, somewhere in the middle of two playoff defeats to LeBron and Miami, Vogel noticed that LeBron spent most of his time playing at a different position. And here we are. Does this have anything to do with the departures of David West and Roy Hibbert? Definitely. The Pacers were praying that Hibbert would opt out of the final year of his deal, with Bird publicly hinting that he could be benched this season. When Hibbert refused to opt out, he was dealt to the Lakers. The Pacers were tired of building the entire team in his plodding image. In the wake of Bird’s statements, West expressed his disgust for management’s treatment of Hibbert and called out Bird specifically. Then he opted out of his deal, leaving $11 million on the table to go sign with San Antonio. And all this happened so that Paul George could play the 4? Sort of. And now that the starting power forward (West) is in San Antonio, the Pacers really need George to buy into this plan. So how does Paul George feel about this idea? Let’s call it lukewarm. “Um, you know it’s, uh, I was open for — to try it out,” George told USA Today‘s Sam Amick last week. “It’s definitely a change. It’s something new. We’ll see how it goes. As the season goes, it might be better for me to just be at my regular position. But I told them I was open to the situation and (we’ll) see where it goes.” He’s open to trying it. Sure. We’ll see what happens, though. And, you know, as the season goes, it might be better to just not do this. Meanwhile, West is quick to chime in with his own assessment: ""He ain't gonna play power forward."" – David West on Paul George playing pf in Indy — AP (@Ananth_Pandian) September 28, 2015  He’s basically making the RG3 face at this whole plan. Correct.  Does he have a point? Maybe. It’s hard to blame him. What are the concerns? Well, coming off a broken leg, the idea of spending a season banging down low with bigger players is a little bit daunting. As George explains it: “It’s just being outmatched strength-wise with guys at the 4 spot is really the only concern. It’s not really the concern for one game. It’s the concern just over the course of a season just how my body would take it, especially coming off the injury that I had and a whole year of rehabbing.” It’s similar to the worry Randy Wittman cited when explaining why he hadn’t been using Paul Pierce as a stretch 4 during the regular season. Earlier this year, Jared Dudley mentioned George specifically on The Lowe Post: “With Paul George, it’ll be taxing to his body,” he said. “Because they’re going to bang him. He’s going to have to box out every possession, because every 4’s going to go rebound on him.” Dudley has spent most of his career playing stretch 4, so he speaks from experience. It should be noted that he’s missing the first three months of this season after back surgery. Are there any other risks? Well, after destroying the relationship with West, antagonizing the franchise player might not be the wisest course of action for Larry Bird. Also, I mentioned this delicate situation to someone else at Grantland, and he said, “I smell a midseason Vogel firing.” There you go. All of this seems like a bad idea.  Incorrect. We’re just straight up ignoring superstars’ wishes now? Playing an All-Star out of position coming off a broken leg?
 In this case, it has to be done. And I don’t really think putting Paul George at the 4 is playing him out of position. You could get into all kinds of sophistry about what constitutes a true power forward in today’s NBA versus a wing playing small ball, but that’s a discussion for another column. For now, just stop overthinking this. Get excited. Why should anyone be excited about Paul George playing power forward? Because watching George try to carry the offense at small forward was nearly as painful as watching the Pacers try to be a contender with Roy Hibbert. If this shift were just about optimizing the Pacers’ roster to play small with Monta Ellis and Rodney Stuckey, the logic would be much harder to defend. But no. This is about the Pacers weaponizing Paul George. It makes sense that George would be cautious. Hearing “power forward” conjures images of Zach Randolph, and nobody wants to imagine a night against Z-Bo, especially someone coming off a broken leg. We’re still learning about what smaller players can handle. Most players aren’t as injury-prone as Dudley, but the concern over wear and tear is reasonable. Vogel will have to be careful about managing George’s minutes at the 4. But even if there will be nights when George’s job gets a little bit more complicated on defense, the uptick in his quality of life on offense could make the whole thing worth it. At small forward, George struggled to create off the dribble — especially in the playoffs. He still got his numbers, and his defense made him an All-NBA candidate regardless, but his game could look ugly as he tried to assert himself, and the Pacers offense wasn’t much better. When his favorite move — long, contested pull-up jumpers — wasn’t working, he had few other options in the half court. That’s when it got painful watching George try to be MVP. “I’m coming back as a fresh new player, with a new team,” George said this week. “But I’m not limiting myself. I still have the aspiration of being the MVP.” Right. He wants to be mentioned alongside KD and LeBron. Playing power forward is how he can do it?  Playing power forward is how he can do it. This is where we end: People may see this as a case of Larry Bird asking too much of his best player, but really, this is the same kind of divine lineup intervention that made Dirk Nowitzki unstoppable. It’s also the change that someone like Carmelo Anthony never got in his prime. A smaller Pacers lineup means a faster Pacers team, which ultimately means George will get more easy looks in transition. In the half court, as he spaces the perimeter playing power forward, he’ll have the opportunity to match up with bigger players who are less equipped to handle his first step. Here, watch what he does to two power forwards:  With no Hibbert or West down low, he’ll have more space than ever to attack the rim. It makes his biggest weakness — creating in the half court — less likely to slow him down. It makes his strengths — size that 3s can’t handle, speed that 4s can’t handle, shooting, finishing at the rim — more dangerous than ever. It’s not that he’ll be playing out of position to suit his teammates; he’ll be playing the position that best suits his skills. The rest of us should be psyched. The soul-crushing Pacers of the past are done, and if this change works, George could match KD and LeBron by playing a different game, and one that makes a lot more sense. He’s Scottie Pippen, not Jordan. And if Scottie Pippen played today, he would be absolutely vicious as a slashing stretch 4. That’s what’s on the table for Paul George this season. It might be “taxing on his body,” as Dudley warned. But it could pay off, too.",2015-09-30T13:18:41+00:00,2015 NBA Preview,Sharp
165,"NBA Media Day Winners and Losers: KD Is Back, Bargnani Is Wax, and More","The NBA returned to our lives with Monday’s media day, and we couldn’t resist collecting some highlights. Here’s a look back at who won and who lost during the NBA’s first full day back in the spotlight.  Netflix Andrew Sharp: The most anticipated return in the NBA this year is not Steph Curry, LeBron James, Paul George, or anyone in the world but Kevin Durant. His game is deadlier than ever, he’s grown into his personality over the past few years, and last season’s NBA wasn’t quite the same without him or the full-strength Thunder. He could have said almost anything yesterday and Thunder media day would have been a success. It’s just good to remember that soon enough, KD will be back on a basketball court. So, he gave the obligatory health update: Kevin Durant: ""Feel great. Ready to go. Did everything necessary for me to get back on the court."" — Anthony Slater (@anthonyVslater) September 28, 2015  He joked about Texas football: Kevin Durant asked about being at the Texas game: ""That's a low blow, man."" — Anthony Slater (@anthonyVslater) September 28, 2015  He complimented Billy Donovan: Kevin Durant on Billy Donovan: ""Great basketball mind, but more importantly a better person. We've hit it off."" — Anthony Slater (@anthonyVslater) September 28, 2015  He discussed the potential of fans in Oklahoma City lobbying for him to return next summer, saying, “I just enjoy playing the game of basketball and I enjoy these wonderful fans here and I just want to give them the best version of me I can. That’s all I can do. I can’t control everything else.” Very diplomatic, saying the right things, etc. Then a reporter asked about his trip to Spain this summer. Did he learn any Spanish? Kevin Durant: I think I picked up more Spanish from watching @Netflix Narcos than going to Spain this summer — Richard Lawler (@rjcc) September 28, 2015  That’s when things got interesting. Durant went on to say he kind of hated himself for enjoying that show as much as he did, but he doesn’t care. Sometimes it’s refreshing to watch a show that doesn’t ask you to think very much. It kept him busy throughout most of Labor Day weekend. When pressed for more, he admitted that, yes, he does sometimes find himself looking at Russell Westbrook as his very own Gustavo. But he added that he actually sees a lot more Westbrook in Gacha, and really, their roles can change, and the only thing 100 percent certain in this world is that the Spurs are the dumbass FBI agents. He finished the press conference telling reporters that he’s all out of plata, and the whole league is getting nothing but plomo this year. This was all live on SportsCenter, too. Wow. KD is back. #Sixers Okafor: 'We all want to make the playoffs.' — Tom Moore (@tmoore76ers) September 28, 2015  Jason Concepcion: Nobel Prize–winning playwright, Oscar-winning screenwriter, fervent socialist, and all-around white-haired Irish crank George Bernard Shaw once remarked, “Youth is a wonderful thing. What a crime to waste it on children.” Not to disagree with such an eminent dude of letters, but what is youth if not an energetic wastefulness made possible only because the young don’t know how precious life is? Case in point: Sixers lottery pick Jahlil Okafor, who said, “We all want to try to make the playoffs.” This is not new, of course; he’s been saying variations of this since he was picked by Philly. I imagine the reporters thinking to themselves Who is “we?” and glancing over at general manager Sam Hinkie as he pursed his lips, narrowed his beady eyes, and ever so slightly shook his head “no.” To quote Marlo Stanfield, Okafor wants it to be one way, but it’s the other way. He just doesn’t realize it’s that particular way yet. That seems like a wonderful place to be. http://t.co/62pDRXwaqX— Chris Herring (@HerringWSJ) September 28, 2015 Concepcion: One of the great joys of this past offseason was watching Nets fans react to the news that their team had signed ex-Knick Andrea Bargnani. After three solid years of treating the Italian as the sports-discourse version of a gas station bathroom where hobos shoot smack, a not insignificant number of Nets fans deftly spun on their heels and began talking themselves into him. That’s what fans do. If the Knicks signed the Zodiac Killer, I’d probably look up his on-off numbers before deciding if it was a bad deal. So, I come not to bury Bargs, but to praise him. Or, at least, to praise this picture, which I think is one of the greatest pictures ever taken. Bargnani appears startlingly thin but is wearing the same impenetrable duh mask that Raps and Knicks fans know so well. He looks like a wax museum statue from a knockoff Madame Tussauds that specializes in forgettable New York City pros. Sharp: Media day update: Every player in the NBA who’s not a point guard is going to play a little bit of stretch 4 this season. Otto Porter said he wouldn't mind playing a bit of power forward if necessary. Said his role will continue to be the same with D/rebounding. — Michael Sykes, II (@MikeDSykes) September 28, 2015  Jazz power forward Derrick Favors said he's been adding range to his jumper and various other offensive moves. He wants to be a stretch 4. — Jody Genessy (@DJJazzyJody) September 28, 2015  Hoiberg says he's going to play Niko at the three and the four. — Ricky O'Donnell (@SBN_Ricky) September 28, 2015  Terrence Jones says shooting was a major emphasis in his offseason work. He's hoping to space the floor better for Dwight. #StretchFour — Ben DuBose (@BenDuBose) September 28, 2015  Are you reading this article? Are you 6-foot-5 or taller? Have you spent the summer bulking up and/or adding a 3-point shot? Good. We might see a little bit of you at the stretch 4 this season, just to help with spacing. Probably my fav part is @aa000G9 talkin about his ""Hoover board"" purchase and askin ""ya think I'm havin a mid-life crisis?"" ??? — Chris Vernon (@ChrisVernonShow) September 29, 2015  Sharp: It turns out that initial dreams/worries of an NBA media day conducted entirely on PhunkeeDucks were misplaced. You’ll remember the PhunkeeDuck as that hover scooter thing that J.R. Smith used to enter (and exit) last year’s NBA Finals, and it quickly became the hottest accessory in the NBA over the summer. You laugh at this, but look deep in your heart and admit it: a $1,500 hovering scooter would be a lot of fun to screw around with for at least two weeks. Alas, after some investigation, the PhunkeeDucks were notably absent from NBA media day. Reggie Jackson had one in Detroit, DeJuan Blair hovered around on one in Washington, and Thaddeus Young threatened to commute to Nets games via PhunkeeDuck. Otherwise, it was a quiet day, until I found out that Tony Allen calls his a “hoover board,” like a skateboard that is also a vacuum that is also a midlife crisis. That made the entire PhunkeeDuck inquiry worth it. Go Grizzlies. Even #Nets GM Billy King getting in on the Twitter Mirror action! #NetsMediaDay http://t.co/QucXg6yinl— Brooklyn Nets (@BrooklynNets) September 28, 2015 Concepcion: Watch Billy King take us through the stages of being a GM.  Shock when you realize you have dealt away all your team’s draft picks.  Hope when you remember that you play in the East.  Relief that you still have a job. D'Angelo Russell says he has gathered some important insight while talking to Kobe: ""He told me he likes to shoot the ball."" — Greg Beacham (@gregbeacham) September 28, 2015  Sharp: Russ, explaining his summer: “Paris was great, fashion week was great, did a great job of just going out there and networking …” When he said that, I remembered how funny it is that this man somehow wound up living in Oklahoma, and then I blacked out for the rest of his answer. Do not pity Westbrook. Life in OKC is great, because it means he’s in the NBA. If an NFL quarterback ever returned to training camp talking about all the networking he did at Paris Fashion Week, there would be a five-week nationwide referendum to determine whether he gets it. In OKC, everyone shrugs like, “Cool, Russ is back.” New story: Kyrie, LeBron cite ""rage"" and ""anger"" from Finals disappointment as fuel for the 2015-16 season http://t.co/jfWwjtba3l — Dave McMenamin (@mcten) September 28, 2015  Steph Curry says Kerr always has said, ""The second year is when you really take off,"" as far as the #Warriors system is concerned. — LetsGoWarriors (@LetsGoWarriors) September 28, 2015  Sharp: There will be plenty of drama for the next nine months, but let’s all keep in mind that it’s probably going to be Warriors-Cavs again in June. Oh. My. God. pic.twitter.com/ApDZULok5X — whitney (@its_whitney) September 28, 2015  Sharp: Poor Frank Vogel. This was for a team calendar in which players pose as superheroes, and he got stuck with Hawkeye — the most useless superhero in the Marvel Universe. Then again, he’s leaning into the role, and that makes him more fun than almost any other coach in the league. Maybe he belongs in the winners section. Sharp: George Hill was going to be in the winners section, because keeping promises is important. Defiant George Hill: told teammates he was going to blonde his hair. they didn’t believe him — he did. And even went double blonde for today — Candace Buckner (@CandaceDBuckner) September 28, 2015  But keeping promises is not that important. Celeste Ballou/NBAE via Getty Images That is the cover of the shittiest R&B record in human history. Concepcion: It feels wrong to speak ill of a dude coming off a mysterious surgery, who will miss the start of camp, and who may or may not be available at the start of the season. But here we are. Parsons and the Mavs spent this past spring playing coy about exactly what procedure was performed on his incredibly handsome knee. “I don’t think they want me to answer if it was or not,” replied Chandy when asked, straight-up, whether he had undergone the dreaded microfracture surgery. Which is weird, yeah, but also understandable in that Mark Cuban had recently signed Parsons to a three-year, $46 million deal. Having Chandler linked to a surgery that Amar’e Stoudemire recently said he “would never have gotten” had he realized how arduous the rehab was is a pretty bad look, even if it’s the authentic look. Fast-forward nearly five months and, according to sources, the procedure that Parsons had back in May was a “minor hybrid” microfracture that makes it sound like Chandy had some kind of benign Pokemon removed from his leg. Then, on media day, to add actual insult to legitimate injury, this happened: Dwight just read a promo saying he's not a male model like his friend Chandler, but he goes farther in the playoffs. pic.twitter.com/MqUkDvJ84k — ClutchFans (@clutchfans) September 28, 2015  Dave Joerger: ""We're doing this P3 thing (for conditioning) and some of the reports back are that our guys are not in tremendous shape."" — Peter Edmiston (@peteredmiston) September 28, 2015  Sharp: You think you’re opposed to biological testing for pro athletes, but then you consider the prospect of Zach Randolph’s test results one day becoming public record. We wouldn’t even need a name, really. “One player has 38 percent body fat, he runs the mile in 13 minutes and six seconds, his heart is the size of a small horse’s, and his blood type is macaroni and cheese.” And he’s the best player. Go Grizzlies. Joe Johnson said he was surprised Deron Williams wanted to be bought out. ""It's not that bad here."" — devin kharpertian (@uuords) September 28, 2015  Melo at Media Day pic.twitter.com/M0G2FjFr71 — Al Iannazzone (@Al_Iannazzone) September 28, 2015  Concepcion: Melo is 31, heading into the second year of his five-year, $124 million contract. By all the lights of logic and reason and our innate understanding of the aging process, it is probably fair to characterize Melo’s title window as technically open but steadily closing. So, when rumors surfaced after the draft that Anthony was unhappy with the Knicks selecting Latvian stretch big Kristaps Porzingis instead of a more “NBA ready” player, they had a certain ring of truthiness to them. Surely, this line of thinking goes, Melo will demand to be traded and Phil Jackson will gleefully acquiesce to the demand. Since then, though, Anthony has been on a charm offensive, straight out of the lyrics to “Everything Is Awesome.” Melo now says he wants to mentor Porzingis and act as his “big brother.” Everything is cool when you’re part of a team, apparently, even if that team just picked a prospect who might not be ready to effectively contribute for the next few seasons. Meanwhile, Phil has brought in better pieces, even if they don’t quite fit together. Arron Afflalo and Robin Lopez are clear upgrades and solid pros. I am a Kyle O’Quinn fan. Sasha “the Machine” Vujacic is a person who can ostensibly still hit 3s and annoy opponents, especially Goran Dragic. All of which is to say — 37 wins seems like a fair best-case scenario. No matter what Melo says now and throughout the season about fraternity and team and sticking out the rebuild, I feel as if the collective response of Knicks fans, and NBA watchers in general, will be something like this.

166,"Don’t Panic, But Maybe Panic: Advice for the Seahawks, Cowboys, Colts, and More","What’s great and ridiculous about the current sports media landscape is that every team or player’s misstep becomes magnified. Every bit of bad news is potentially cause for grave concern. After a while, you see how this works and realize that we are constantly losing our minds. Nowhere is this more true than the NFL. It’s been only two weeks and half the teams in the league are already on high alert. Some of them will power through this turmoil and be just fine. For others, this is only the beginning. Should you be panicking right now? Are you freaked out enough? Let’s take a look around the league. There’s a chance that the value of offensive line play becomes the unifying theme to the NFL season, and in that case, the Seahawks could turn into a case study of what not to do. They traded their best lineman to the Saints in a deal for Jimmy Graham, and the rest of the line looks even more overwhelmed than it has in previous years. It finally seems like it’s starting to matter. Russell Wilson was more comfortable against the Packers than he was against the Rams, but Marshawn Lynch couldn’t get going in either game. Whether you blame Lynch or the line, it’s not a great sign. And all of this is before you get to Kam Chancellor’s holdout and a defense that’s been strangely mortal for two weeks straight. Meanwhile, Arizona looks fantastic on both sides of the ball, Marshawn’s mom is yelling about the coaches on Facebook, and Graham is already unhappy with his role in the offense. There are some red flags here. Then again, they opened the year with two road games against two good teams, they will likely win seven or eight games at home, and it’s not very hard to imagine them getting from there to 10 or 11 wins and the playoffs. Lynch is too good to struggle for much longer, Wilson is still obnoxious as hell to try to defend, and the defense should be able to throttle people with or without Chancellor. It’s not great right now, but it’s too early to start sounding the “End of an Era” alarm. Also, Seahawks fans are too emotionally numb after the Super Bowl to let two regular-season games disturb them too much. Panic Advisory: Don’t panic. Look at Aaron Donald. I finally understand what Robert Mays and Bill Barnwell have been so excited about this whole time. Good lord.  Now imagine how this feels for Rams fans who have lived through the past few years of Jeff Fisher. That win over Seattle could not have been more encouraging. Nick Foles looked awesome, the defensive line came together, Tavon Austin was making plays. Then everyone plays like it’s 2012, they lose to the Redskins, and it’s like that Week 1 game never happened. Now here we are again: Wondering why the Rams don’t win more, watching random defensive line highlights. Panic Advisory: PANIC.  On the one hand, this offense has zero weapons beyond Steve Smith Sr., the defense’s best player is out for the year, and the strength of the team (defense) just gave up 37 points to the Raiders. On the other hand … the Ravens are the Chicago Bulls of football. They are never as explosive as preseason predictions promise, but they never really disappear, either. Baltimore’s first two losses this season came on the road — first to the Broncos, in a game that could’ve gone either way, and then in a late-game shootout in Oakland, which is sort of like losing in the NFL twilight zone. Those losses are a reminder that the Ravens probably don’t have enough to contend for a Super Bowl this year. But those losses are not proof that they’ll be irrelevant in the AFC North. The Ravens will probably figure it out and be just as miserable to play against as they are every season. Losing Terrell Suggs for the year hurts, and the offense won’t win many games on its own, but the next games are against the Bengals at home and the Steelers on the road. There is plenty of opportunity for them to get back on track, and this roster isn’t that far removed from the team that almost beat the Patriots in the playoffs. Panic Advisory: Don’t panic until Sunday at the earliest.
 IT’S WEEDEN SEASON.  “This quarterback Weeden can drive the ball down field,” Jerry Jones said this week. “He’s a thing of beauty on throwing a football. His passing motion and his arm, frankly, you won’t see a more gifted passer, power, accuracy, the entire aspect of it.” Jerry Jones should not be allowed to speak in public. However, the Cowboys stole that win against the Giants, and that helps make the immediate future look a lot more bearable. They don’t need to be dominant to stay alive until December, and Weeden might not be completely overmatched if his only job is to hand the ball to Joseph Randle and Darren McFadden. Dez Bryant and Tony Romo were the two irreplaceable players on the roster coming into the season, and … Cowboys acquire Matt Cassel. His 34.6 Total QBR since '12 is 4th-lowest (min. 500 action plays). Lowest QBR since '12…Brandon Weeden, 26.1 — ESPN Stats & Info (@ESPNStatsInfo) September 22, 2015  … now I guess we’re talking about Matt Cassel and Brandon Weeden. Wow. OK. But somehow this new reality doesn’t feel catastrophic. Instead of dread, I’m feeling … cautious optimism? Panic Advisory: I already regret not panicking about this more.
 There are no more receivers in Carolina. As if this unit needed another injury… #Panthers WR Jerricho Cotchery suffered a high-ankle sprain, I’m told. That’s usually 4-6 weeks — Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) September 21, 2015  Even if Jerricho Cotchery plays through that injury, there are no receivers in Carolina, because when Jerricho Cotchery is a loss, you’ve already lost. The Panthers are 2-0 after beating the Jaguars and Texans, but this seems like it could be an issue. Panic Advisory: Keep the panic in perspective. Remember who you played last week. Having no receivers is better than having no quarterbacks.   Panic Advisory: Everything is fine, definitely, nothing to worry about. This is how Antonio Brown showed up to training camp this year.  He’s catching 20 touchdowns this year. Julio Jones is catching 25. Panic Advisory: The president’s speech from Armageddon is the best pregame pep talk a defensive coordinator could give in this scenario.  I’m not sure if the past two weeks can even be considered a cause for alarm. The Saints might just be bad now. They’re definitely not good, and no amount of Brandin Cooks will be enough to make Drew Brees five years younger. Panic Advisory: Don’t panic, just watch LSU games for the next two years.
 This is tricky. The AFC South is much, much worse than any other division in football. The AFC, in general, has like four good teams. It should be very difficult to miss the playoffs. The Colts started 0-2 last year and finished 11-5. I know all of this, I know that Colts fans shouldn’t be worried. And yet: Chuck Pagano is calling out his GM and his quarterback, Frank Gore can’t do anything, Andre Johnson isn’t making a difference, and the defense is actually worse than the crappy defense they had last year. It’s one thing to assume the Colts will be good regardless with Andrew Luck. That’s probably true. But what if this is a year of transition, and “good” comes next year, with a new coach and GM? This thing, to me, is on the verge of getting really ugly. If they don't get a win on Sunday, Pagano's head might explode. — Stephen Holder (@HolderStephen) September 22, 2015  Every NFL season brings at least one supposed good team whose season just goes down in flames. This Colts team seems like a decent candidate to be that team in 2015. Panic Advisory: Heads might explode this weekend. Someone actually wrote that.  This Eagles team is the other candidate for would-be contender that turns into a full-on disaster. There are definitely some Steve Spurrier vibes coming out of Philadelphia. For one thing, the Cowboys were calling out Philly’s plays on Sunday. For another, this Robert Mays sentence: “The decision to run $22 million guaranteed of running backs behind $1.1 million of guards seems to be backfiring.” When you put it like that … Yeah, that’s pretty damning. And this stat is incredible: #Eagles CB Byron Maxwell (6-yr, $64m contract offseason) has been thrown at 19x, allowed 15 comp, 240 yds, 2 TD, 158.3 (perfect) QB rating — Connor Hughes (@Connor_J_Hughes) September 21, 2015  On the other hand, the NFL is better than any other sport at making every analyst look stupid, so as the whole world doubts Chip Kelly, it’s probably worth it to wait a few weeks just to be safe. Kelly’s horrendous offseason decisions may cost them in the end, but this didn’t become a last-place team overnight. The Eagles looked very good in the second half against the Falcons, and it’s hard to imagine they look as bad as they did Sunday at any point the rest of the season. They play the Jets this weekend and the Redskins in Week 4, and both of those games are winnable. Panic Advisory: Give it until the Jets game, at least.  Andy Lyons/Getty Images The Jets might be good, the Jets might be good — I REPEAT — the Jets might be good. Panic Advisory: Deep down, every Jets fan in the world finds all of this optimism terrifying. PANIC.",2015-09-23T10:11:02+00:00,NFL,Sharp
167,The Running Back Race Is the Best Debate in College Football,"There’s a chance that both Tre Mason and Todd Gurley could suit up for the St. Louis Rams on Sunday. That is madness. Two of the most dominant running backs in recent college football history are on the same team, in the same backfield. Of course, in the NFL, this barely registers as news. Tre Mason isn’t a star, and Todd Gurley is only a rookie. This is why it’s important to cherish running backs while they’re still in school and still making defenses look helpless. It’s the Reggie Bush rule. The most exciting players in this sport are always more fun in college. So I come to you today with a proposal: Forget the Heisman race. Let’s talk about the race to determine the best running back in college football. It was only a year ago that Gurley, Melvin Gordon, and Ameer Abdullah were supposed to usher in a return of running back dominance — maybe it will happen in the NFL this year — but it turns out that that was just a prelude. This year is when things get crazy. Look around the country and you’ll find more dominating backs than ever, and they all torture defenses in different ways. It raises the question: If you could choose any running back in America, who would it be? Put your Doak Walker pants on. These are the contenders in 2015. Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images Nickname: Do It Again. Year: Sophomore. Superpower: Blinding speed. Weaknesses: Fumbles, durability, off-field issues. Highlights: It’s hard to imagine any running back going for 266 yards in a single game, but watch this run from Saturday, and … yeah, makes sense.  Analysis: Florida State’s offense entered this season without Jameis Winston, Rashad Greene, Nick O’Leary, and four offensive linemen from last year, all of whom now play in the NFL. In total, FSU lost half its starters. On Saturday, new starting quarterback Everett Golson finished the first half with six yards passing. The offensive line was a mess, too. And Dalvin Cook was so good that none of it mattered. This is the Seminoles’ blueprint for 2015. His fumbles in the Rose Bowl helped turn a close game into an Oregon blowout, and this season is a chance for Cook to redeem himself. He was the best freshman in America last year, and after being found not guilty on battery charges that clouded his future this summer, he is Florida State’s only hope of remaining in the title hunt in 2015. It may not work, but it’ll be fun to watch him try. “Fast” as a descriptor doesn’t quite do his running justice. Just imagine trying to catch a rabbit with your bare hands. That’s how defenders look when chasing Dalvin Cook. He’s also bouncier and stronger than he looks. He’s got an uphill battle to outshine the rest of this list, but given the situation at FSU, he’ll get more chances than anyone else. Jonathan Bachman/AP Nickname: His grandmother calls him Button, but his real name is Leonard Fournette. A nickname would be counterproductive in this case. Year: Sophomore. Superpower: Linebacker size with cornerback’s feet. Weaknesses: Quarterback, hubris. Highlights: He will run around you …  … he will run over you.  Analysis: If we’re judging on talent alone, Fournette is tough to argue against. This dude can do everything. He’s big like Derrick Henry, he’s fast like Cook, he will run through tackles like Ezekiel Elliott, and he can carry an offense like Nick Chubb. He can also play quarterback. He just needs to work on putting it all together for an entire season. Doing that is easier said than done. Like Cook, he’s playing on an offense without a great quarterback, but unlike Cook, he’ll be stuck getting hammered by SEC defenses every week. Eight-man fronts at Wake Forest and Louisville are not quite the same as those at Alabama and Auburn. In other words, for LSU’s offense to contend this year, it’ll need Fournette to be something close to superhuman. And, hey, that is entirely possible. Streeter Lecka/Getty Images Nickname: Zeke. Year: Junior. Superpower: Single-handedly ruined all of our jokes about Big Ten speed. Weaknesses: Quarterbacks, boredom, the NCAA’s puritanical war against the crop top jersey. Highlights: 36 carries, 246 yards, four touchdowns, and headlines like “Ohio State’s Ezekiel Elliott absolutely dominates National Championship.” Ezekiel Elliot against Oregon's defense. https://t.co/wWpaxJcJAQ — LeB R O N J A M E S (@LeKingJames23) January 13, 2015  Analysis: What he did to Oregon in the national title game probably didn’t get the credit it deserves. That was as ruthless as anything that happened in college football all year. It was like watching someone perform a Mortal Kombat fatality move for three hours straight. The Cardale Jones story at the end of the season was so crazy that it was hard to focus on anything else, and that’s fine. But remember this: Ezekiel Elliott finished the year with 696 yards against Wisconsin, Alabama, and Oregon.  That is insane. Those are numbers that would make you crank up the difficulty if they happened in NCAA Football. It’s up to you to decide how much of the credit goes to Urban Meyer’s scheme, the threat of the passing game, and Elliott himself. I can’t decide. Would he be this good at LSU or Florida State? Maybe not. He’s got the opposite problem of Fournette and Cook. He’s got two great quarterbacks and is surrounded by talent, which makes it harder to appreciate his contributions. John Bazemore/AP Nickname: Chubbatron. Year: Sophomore. Superpower: So good that he’s made the name “Nick Chubb” cool. Weakness: The curse of Georgia running backs. Highlights: Between the hypnotic techno and the highlights, the below video could’ve been 40 minutes long and I would have watched the whole thing. If you’re looking for brevity, this Vine is a good recap of the Belk Bowl.  Analysis: He is probably the least spectacular player on this list. It’s not that he’s any worse, but he doesn’t quite have the sex appeal of guys who make it look easy to turn defenses upside down. When Chubb runs, it looks like work. The closest comparison is probably Emmitt Smith, another undersized running back from the SEC who was neither stronger nor faster than any of his peers. He was just better, every year, until he retired as the NFL’s all-time leading rusher. I’m not putting those Emmitt Smith expectations on Chubb, but it’s the best way to explain how he fits into this conversation. He’s the consistent one. Dalvin Cook had 266 yards against South Florida, you say? Chubb had 266 yards against a top-20 Louisville team last year, and 202 with two touchdowns against an Arkansas defense that limited Fournette to five carries and nine yards. On Saturday, he had 189 against Vanderbilt. He played the first half of last year in the shadow of Todd Gurley, and now we get to see if he can keep this pace for a full year. That’s all he has left to prove. That, and doing this while beating Alabama on October 3, ending Georgia’s cursed history of post–Herschel Walker running backs, and being good enough to make the “We’re not panicking” quarterback policy irrelevant. So, actually, yeah: There’s plenty of room to make a name for himself here. Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images Nickname: EL TRACTORCITO. Year: Junior. Superpower: “Everybody just say he’s a big monster,” says his 248-pound fullback. “He makes me look like a midget.” Weaknesses: Speed, quarterback. Highlights:   Analysis: I’ve never been so certain that a player should not be allowed to play college football. And all I want to do is watch Derrick Henry play college football. Against Wisconsin in Week 1, Henry had 13 carries for 147 yards and three touchdowns. He moves through defenses like a tank. It’s not even violent, it’s just inevitable. He will take your blitzing linebacker and laugh his way through the blocking assignment. He will run through arm tacklers like they’re not even there. He never really gets tackled at all; he just sort of collapses forward in the middle of three people. You never know when one of his routine 6-yard rumbles will turn into a glorious 60-yard rumble. He split carries with T.J. Yeldon last year, but now he’s no. 1 on the depth chart, and with Kenyan Drake’s speed coupled with Henry’s power, Alabama may not even need to have a quarterback on the field. This weekend it has a rematch against Ole Miss’s killer defense, and that will be a significant test. Even speaking as a Tractorcito evangelist, though, he’s got more to prove than anyone on this list. Can he stay healthy? Will he still be explosive if he’s doing this 20 times a game? This section has compared him to a tractor, a tank, a monster, and a fictional dinosaur … but what if Alabama can’t find a passing game? Will El Tractorcito be enough to carry the load? The leader on this list will change at least five times this season, and we didn’t even mention Samaje Perine. It’s so much better than the Heisman. For right now, just watch these guys go nuts and try to steal the spotlight from each other every week. Cook plays at Boston College tonight, and Fournette is up next against Auburn on Saturday afternoon. Derrick Henry plays Ole Miss at 9:15 p.m. ET on Saturday.

168,The Pac-12 and the Smartest Way to Pay College Athletes,"The debate over paying college athletes has always had too many dead ends to ever really get anywhere. How do you do it? Who pays the salaries? Which players get paid, and how much? Is there some kind of salary cap? Do conferences secede from the NCAA? How many athletic programs would go under if they suddenly had to pay an entire roster of football players? This is the problem. Any one of those questions is knotty enough to stall any real change. That’s not to say there hasn’t been progress. We still get the occasional story like the president of Notre Dame threatening to leave the NCAA if players get paid, but in general, attitudes have evolved. Somewhere between outrage at Ohio State players exchanging signed memorabilia for tattoos and apathy in the face of Johnny Manziel (allegedly) selling autographs, most reasonable people probably decided college players deserve to make money somehow. The idea that used to feel radical is now almost redundant. Of course they should be getting paid. So: Here is a tremendous Nike commercial that debuted this weekend.  That commercial is how the world can pay college athletes. We don’t have to make this too complicated, or answer 10 questions, or call for a revolution to overthrow all the people running college sports. Just let Nike do it. Let Under Armour do it — and Adidas, and anyone else who wants to pay college athletes to be in their commercials, or make local appearances, or sign autographs, or license their name to be included in the greatest sports video game of all time. It’s the one change that’s been obvious this whole time, and we’re getting closer. Last Friday afternoon, with most of the world checked out for the week, the Pac-12 almost got it right. The conference announced a proposal that would allow athletes the chance to make money off their names and likenesses. As the Associated Press reported, it will be voted on by five major conferences at the NCAA convention in January. This is incredible, I thought when I saw the headline. It could change college sports forever, without really changing much at all. This is the dream. Then a beat. Why isn’t this a bigger deal? The fine print, via Jon Solomon at CBS Sports: Pac-12 deputy commissioner Jamie Zaninovich said athletes would be able to promote themselves without identifying themselves as an athlete. … He said the idea is not to allow athletes to be paid off their athletic success, such as for autographs. He compared this proposal to the NCAA rule change years ago that allows athletes to have jobs if they demonstrate they’re actually performing work and getting paid at the going rate. Oh. College athletes would be able to make money off their name (good start), provided nobody knows they’re a college athlete (what?), and that it has nothing to do with their athletic success (…). It’s the kind of tortured reasoning that’s required to maintain a system that defies logic. But it’s also a good excuse to talk about how this perpetual argument over the future of college sports will eventually end. BRANGER/ROGER VIOLLET/GETTY IMAGES The Olympics had a similar problem with amateurism until about 30 years ago, when the international community decided it didn’t make sense to demand that all the best athletes in the world take a vow of poverty. Ever since, the most successful Olympians in the world make money from Wheaties, Visa, Nike, and everyone else who wants to co-opt their feel-good story. College athletes could cash in the same way. Nobody in the NCAA has to write new rules; just repeal the ones that never made sense. The Olympic changes were preceded by all kinds of angst and fearmongering that stalled the shift for as long as possible. In 1955, American IOC president Avery Brundage warned, “We can only rely on the support of those who believe in the principles of fair play and sportsmanship embodied in the amateur code in our efforts to prevent the Games from being used by individuals, organizations or nations for ulterior motives.” That “amateur code” is how the International Olympic Committee justified moves like stripping gold medals from one of the greatest athletes of all time, Jim Thorpe, when it was revealed that he’d played two summers of semipro baseball before the 1912 Olympics. One hundred years later, the rules are different, and the Olympics have only gotten better. College sports will eventually live a similar story. Even now, reading about how Thorpe lost his gold medals really isn’t that far removed from reading about Reggie Bush losing his Heisman. They took his trophy away for what? Because he was living in someone else’s house? Getting $1,500 a week? You can argue all day about whether it’s viable for any school to put an entire roster of athletes on its payroll, but there’s plenty of other money out there, and denying stars a chance to capitalize on that feels, at best, counterproductive. It’s the sort of thing that’s so clearly unfair it could absolutely lead to a lawsuit that brings down everything. And that’s why it makes sense for conferences to make concessions. Allowing players to make money on their own gives college sports the best chance of surviving in the 21st century. For one thing, it alleviates the pressure on schools to pay players themselves. You don’t have to buy in when people crow about the value of a scholarship, but when administrators say that most athletic departments can’t afford to pay a salary to 80 or 90 college football players while maintaining all the other sports, it’s generally true. Likewise, it’s bad enough that publicly funded state schools spend millions of dollars wooing coaches, but this could get awfully unhealthy if public schools are suddenly competing to pay players, too. It’s also fair to point out that most major college athletes aren’t the ones generating the revenue swirling around college sports. The same way people watch every Olympics regardless of who’s swimming, LSU football will fill Tiger Stadium no matter who’s playing. These are the practical arguments against turning the NCAA into a free-market economy overnight, and some of them make a decent amount of sense. But none of that means Leonard Fournette shouldn’t be allowed to sign a shoe deal, or make a few grand doing an ad for a local car dealership. If Les Miles can charge tens of thousands of dollars for speaking engagements all summer — side note: I would pay anything to have Les Miles come talk to Grantland — there’s no reason his players should be banned from doing the same. ANDY LYONS/GETTY IMAGES At perennially dominant programs (Oregon and Alabama football, Duke basketball, etc.), brands like Nike or Adidas could pay stipends to every starter, and it could be negotiated into the overall licensing fee they give to schools. At smaller schools, it would be closer to the status quo, where most athletes play for little more than a scholarship. In other words, most of college sports would look the same. Powerhouses would have a massive recruiting advantage, but that’s always been true. Upsets would still shock the world when those advantages are rendered irrelevant. Sponsors would just make the hierarchy more official, and something closer to fair for the players. If anyone doubts that brands would be interested in funding this reality, shoe companies are currently doing battle in the shadows and flying high school stars to the Bahamas, reminding the world that the interest is already there. Going to school would continue to be part of the job for star athletes in college, but it’s never been the no. 1 priority, and for the best college athletes in the country, it probably shouldn’t be. There’s too much life-changing money available to worry about protecting the pretense that classes matter most. Last year, Rand Getlin and Dan Wetzel of Yahoo had a great story on Manziel and the $10 million or so in market value he left on the table at Texas A&M. That’s money that will never be claimed, and had it been available, his former manager says it could have kept him in college another year, which would have meant even more money for Texas A&M, too. But it wasn’t available, and so everyone loses, and whether it was Todd Gurley last year or Maurice Clarett 12 years ago, it’s become fairly common for the current rules to cost everyone. That’s why the Pac-12 proposal is important. Even mentioning “likenesses” in the same press release as “revenue” is a good start. From there, it’s really not that hard to imagine a future in which current Oregon players are in an Animal House commercial next to Dan Fouts, Under Armour is paying big money to schools and a handful of stars to steal market share, and we’re all playing NCAA Football every summer while players around the country collect a check in return. It’s the idea that makes the most sense. Allowing stars to hire representation and negotiate deals themselves could solve so much about the college sports economy that currently looks unfair. Even that president of Notre Dame agrees. While Rev. John I. Jenkins told the New York Times last week that Notre Dame uses the $80 million it makes from football to pay for every other program in its athletic department, and as sure as he was that schools paying athletes on an open market would ruin college sports, he conceded that he’d be fine with a quarterback selling an autograph to capitalize on his fame. As Father Jenkins said, “That seems to be where we’re going.”",2015-09-16T09:46:16+00:00,College Football,Sharp
169,17 Fearless (and Completely Arbitrary) Predictions for the 2015 NFL Season,"Summer is officially over as of last night. There are no more previews to read, and there are only games to watch. We made it. I wrote about the state of the NFL yesterday, and with that out of the way, it’s time to share some reckless opinions on what this season will actually look like. If you’re looking for in-depth research and logic, just bail out now. If you’re looking for inexplicable confidence that will surely look regrettable in just a few weeks, well then hey, let’s do this. 1. Nelson Agholor will be the most productive rookie in the NFL. With all due respect to Jameis Winston and Amari Cooper, this competition won’t be close. First of all, he plays in Chip Kelly’s offense, which is basically like playing on the D’Antoni Suns. Second of all, the Eagles have gotten rid of every other potential superstar, so someone has to fill the void. Third of all, people have been sleeping on USC football as an NFL factory ever since Lane Kiffin took over, and it continues with Steve Sarkisian. The teams haven’t been very good, but the recruiting has been consistently great every year. In other words, if you’re looking for elite talent, let the other teams draft dudes from Alabama and Ohio State 10 spots too high, and wait for the USC guys to fall. This will be the ultimate lesson of Nelson Agholor. Most of all … I saw this Vine a month ago and made a mental note that Agholor will destroy people this year.  2. The Eagles will win the NFC East — and the Super Bowl. Don’t read too much into the preseason, unless, like me, you are a Cowboys fan who spent all summer making fun of the Eagles, only to quickly remember that Kelly still makes defenses look drunk no matter who’s on the field. There’s no way to explain it, but we should all probably fear it. I’m definitely scared enough to jinx them with this prediction. 3. Eli Manning will have a better year than Peyton Manning. I am one of the last people in America who think Eli is good, so maybe this is wishful thinking. Then again, Peyton Manning can’t feel his fingers, has nerve damage in his neck, is 39 years old, and couldn’t really throw last time we saw him play football. Maybe this isn’t as bold as it sounds. 4. L.A. is getting two teams. The Oakland Raiders and St. Louis Rams will make the Los Angeles “dreams” a reality this year, and what’s great about this is how nobody in any three cities will care. 5. Vince Wilfork will snap on J.J. Watt before this year is over. Let’s discuss two scenes from the first episode of Hard Knocks. One scene: a potbellied defensive lineman is chuckling through trash talk and playing pickup basketball with friends and family. Another: an impossibly well-toned human protein shake takes the field under the cover of darkness for a one-man bonus workout — in front of cameras and fans — to prove just how committed he is to Doing The Work. Now, can you guess which one of those men has two Super Bowl rings? That’s right. Because sometimes the universe is great.  Maybe you can enjoy J.J. Watt as a destroyer of worlds on the field, but there’s a breaking point where the overwhelming corniness of his persona makes it impossible to care about anything else. That night workout was the breaking point for me. We get it, man. You’re committed. You do things the right way. Take it down a notch. All of which is to say, if/when Vince Wilfork body-slams J.J. Watt, it won’t be his fault. More 2015 NFL PreviewIt's almost here. For everything you need to know about the new season, follow all of Grantland's coverage.

The Raiders will be better than the 49ers. Carr Bombs to Amari Cooper, who was last seen embarrassing Patrick Peterson, plus Khalil Mack and a completely anonymous running back destined for inexplicable productivity (Latavius Murray). That’s all I need to know. Once every 10 years, the Raiders are decent. That season probably comes next year. For now, even half-decent at 8-8 should be enough to be better than the 49ers, who are coming off of the most disastrous offseason imaginable. 7. The Jaguars will be GOOD. Prepare yourselves. Start doing that Eagles chant with his last name. Tell your friends, hug your family. B-O-R-T-L-E-S. Gus Bradley seems like a good coach, T.J. Yeldon should be solid, Allen Robinson is due to break out. The pieces are there if Bortles delivers, and like the Raiders, there’s a blind-squirrel element to Jacksonville’s success. They’re due. Oh, and did I mention they have a Kiffin-era USC receiver (Marqise Lee)? The Jaguars are making the playoffs. 8. Tyrod Taylor will (almost) start a revolution. The Bills are putting together something special. It’s like they took “It’s so crazy it might work!” and made it the official team policy. The Sammy Watkins trade, EJ Manuel in the first round, LeSean McCoy, cutting Fred Jackson, hiring Rex Ryan to coach a team whose only problem is the one thing Rex has never been good at coaching — now it all hinges on Tyrod Taylor, a quarterback who wasn’t even very good at Virginia Tech. I’ve never loved a team more. Bills fans feel the same way, and everyone is ready to prove the whole world wrong. It will almost work, and Taylor will reach cult-hero status halfway through the year, before reality sets in down the stretch and they go 8-8. I want to believe it will be better than that — the AFC East, playoff wins, the world — but there’s just no way this team will thrive after cutting Fred Jackson and destroying all of the good karma that their reckless decisions had bought them this offseason. 9. Tavon Austin will look extremely promising but then disappear as soon as we start paying attention. The St. Louis Rams experience. 10. Tyler Lockett will be what Tavon Austin could be with a decent quarterback. Or like Percy Harvin but without the fistfights. 11. For at least one week this year, Mike Tomlin and Kevin Sumlin will switch places and nobody will notice. And while we’re on the subject of college football, Derrick Henry highlights at Alabama will be more impressive than anything we see from an NFL running back all year. 12. The Lions: Nope. So many fun pieces, but between Matt Stafford’s ability to break dreams and a defense that’s due to crash back to earth, it seems like this will end poorly. Poor Lions fans. 13. The Dolphins: NOPE. They will look great when they beat the Redskins this weekend, and they’ll probably come into the Week 7 Patriots game at something like 4-2. Then the schedule gets real and it turns into another almost-good season that ends in disappointment. Poor [nobody really cares about the Dolphins]. 14. The Broncos will go 7-9. See no. 4. And: 
 14. The Chargers will go 9-7. The Chargers are never not 9-7. And: 14. The Chiefs are winning the AFC West.   Here is Andy Reid describing the perfect burger in alarming detail: “Then a nice slice of good, fresh Vidalia onion on it. Some mayo and ketchup. A little squirt of mustard but not too much. Pickles, lettuce and tomato and I’m ready to roll. … when you bite into it baby, it’s ecstasy.” The Chiefs are winning 11 games this year, and it will be wonderful. 15. The Redskins will get the no. 1 pick. On the one hand, even reading that sentence induces a shudder when you think about what they might do to Cardale Jones. On the other hand … actually, there is no other hand. This is the darkest possible timeline and the single biggest reason to root for Kirk Cousins this year. 16. Jameis Winston will win a playoff game. There is more about Jameis here, so instead of rehashing that, this is a good time to share general picks for the playoffs that will look incredibly stupid in three weeks. • NFC: (1) Seahawks, (2) Eagles, (3) Packers, (4) Falcons, (5) Bucs, (6) Cowboys
• AFC: (1) Patriots, (2) Colts, (3) Chiefs, (4) Steelers, (5) Ravens, (6) Jaguars
• Wild Card: Bucs over Falcons, Cowboys over Packers, Chiefs over Jaguars, Steelers over Ravens
• Divisional: Cowboys over Seahawks, Eagles over Bucs, Patriots over Steelers, Colts over Chiefs
• Championship: Eagles over Cowboys, Patriots over Colts
• Super Bowl: Eagles over Patriots Can’t believe I picked the Jaguars to make the playoffs. Can’t believe nobody else picked the Jaguars to make the playoffs. 17. The Hayne Plane will fly right into your goddamn heart. Hey. Are you there? Are you ready? Guess who made the team?  HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYNNNNNEEEE PLAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANNNNNNNNNNNNNNE.  Yeah. Disregard everything else on this list. Football is here, and the Hayne Plane is here.

170,Dear Scott Skiles: Please Just Put Mario Hezonja on the Court,"There are a lot of questions that will be answered in Orlando this season. Was Jacque Vaughn the problem the past few years? Is Scott Skiles the solution? Can Victor Oladipo play with Elfrid Payton? Is Vucci Mane actually good, or just fantasy good? And what’s up with Tobias Harris? He’s been in that Derrick Favors “nobody has any idea whether he’s overrated or underrated” zone for a while now. How many years of rebuilding do you get before you need to have something to show for it? It’s not like the rest of the East is setting the world on fire, and Skiles is known for turning things around. Is it time for a playoff push? Questions, questions, questions. The problem is, I don’t really care about the answers. I just want to watch Mario Hezonja.  I wrote about him before the NBA draft, and now it’s four months later. The Hezonja Millennium is finally underway. Skiles has been calling him “Mr. Confidence” in practice for the past month. Over the summer, he hit a buzzer-beating 3 in Europe and dapped up the opposing coach. That was after he debuted in summer league by hitting a game winner. This is an Instagram post that was eventually revealed to be fake, but it’s so real. This is a Tumblr post about Kanye West … He started to perform. People weren’t paying attention. He could feel it. They were talking. He was frustrated. About ¾ of the way into the song. He stopped. “Everyone that is not listening is gonna be mad u had the opportunity to see me perform for the first time.” But it still didn’t silence the crowd. Chatter continued. He jumped off stage. Ran to the top of balcony and screamed at the top of his lungs. Demanded to be heard. To be honest he COMMANDED to be heard. … and it’s also what Mario Hezonja is going to do every night this season. Before the draft, he told Croatian media he should go no. 1 overall. In 2014, he explained his basketball philosophy to the world: Respect? No, I never had respect to anybody on a basketball court. I heard about: “If they smell blood, you get eaten.” I’m not like that. I don’t care. Whether it’s a veteran or a young player standing in front of me I always have the same goal. I want to run over everybody. Two weeks ago, he almost got into a fight with Amar’e Stoudemire. As the Orlando Sentinel recounts: Hezonja set a screen on Stoudemire, and Stoudemire took issue with the play, saying Hezonja had raised his arms before he made contact. Stoudemire confronted Hezonja face-to-face, and Stoudemire was issued a technical foul. “Hezonja didn’t flinch,” according to the Sentinel. Because of course he didn’t. If they smell blood, you get eaten. Put him on the court, Scott Skiles. Don’t talk to me about defense, or shot selection, or maturity. Between Hezonja, Harris, Evan Fournier, and Oladipo, there are minutes questions with this rotation. Those need to become minutes answers. Put. Him. On. The. Court. This is the easiest way to make the Magic a top 10 League Pass team overnight, and more importantly — for Skiles’s purposes — it might be the best way to take the Orlando roster to another level. We can all get what we want here. Look at the big picture: There’s a glut of mediocrity clogging the Eastern Conference. The Pacers, Celtics, Raptors, Bucks, Knicks, and Pistons all have a similar combination of reasonable playoff goals and fairly low ceilings if they ever get there. This has been true for several years. Even as those teams become more respectable, as they should this season, it doesn’t change the baseline of underwhelming basketball across the whole conference. The bottom half of the East would get laughed out of the West. The difference between these two conferences is less a chess/checkers relationship and more of a Coca-Cola/actual cocaine dynamic. In Orlando, management has been biding its time the past few years. This isn’t quite the Sixers model, because there were at least a few good-faith attempts at winning. It just hasn’t worked, either on the court or in the draft. The Magic haven’t gotten lucky in the lottery, and instead of landing a can’t-miss franchise player like Andrew Wiggins or Karl-Anthony Towns, they’ve been left rebuilding around unorthodox talents like Aaron Gordon, Victor Oladipo, and Elfrid Payton. In the meantime, it’s been three years since this team won 30 games. Elsa/Getty Images Hiring Skiles was a sign that management is ready for the next step. At his past two stops in the league, Skiles had the Bucks and Bulls above .500 within his first two years. He’s highly-regarded among coaches around the league, and if the chief worry is that he burns out his players after a few years, he still has a history of getting results in the meantime. So, look at what we have now: Skiles wants to win, and he’s inheriting a bunch of unorthodox building blocks who have looked promising, but haven’t quite fit in past years. What if Hezonja is the keystone that allows all the other pieces to fall into place? Just dream with me for a minute: I would watch every second of that team. That team might make me move to Orlando. At the very least, I’d build a living room shrine to Rob Hennigan for making this all possible. Orlando’s problem the past few years has been shooting, as Zach Lowe outlined toward the end of last season. Adding Hezonja’s range and scoring could open things up for everyone. If you’re worried about defense, you couldn’t pair Hezonja with a more promising defensive backcourt — not to mention Aaron “Training Wheels Shawn Marion” Gordon. This may not be the plan right away, but it should definitely be the blueprint for the future: Go small, play fast, smother opposing guards to death, let Hezonja go off, and bring Tobias Harris and Evan Fournier in as gunners off the bench. It may not work this season. It probably won’t. But if the worst-case scenario is that we get more Mario Hezonja in our lives while Skiles wins about what’s expected — Vegas set the wins over/under at 32.5 — that’s already enough to make this team worth watching. The best-case scenario is that the Magic make a playoff push and find a way to use three or four great young players who will make the entire league more fun. Either way, as soon as Scott Skiles officially jumps on the Hezonja bandwagon, I’m in. Next to everything else that’s happening in the East — the Raptors trying to build a contender around Kyle Lowry and DeMarre Carroll, the Pistons betting big on Reggie Jackson, the Bucks going all in for Greg Monroe and trying to convince themselves Michael Carter-Williams can work, the Celtics pushing Amir Johnson stock on the masses — what’s possible in Orlando is a lot more exciting.

171,"It’s Otto Porter Season in Washington, D.C.","As a Wizards fan, even I have to admit that there may have been times last season when my affection for and/or cultish worship of Otto Porter were not entirely serious. It was fun to treat him like a franchise cornerstone, or a killer secret weapon unleashed at the perfect time to leave Toronto helpless. Until the playoffs, he’d been considered one of the bigger busts from the 2013 draft, which was full of them. Any signs of progress were cause for delirious, over-the-top celebration. But now it’s getting a little real. Have you been watching the preseason?  Are you ready for the Otto Porter era?  Are you ready to have three kids and name them “Otto,” “Porter,” and “Junior”?  Think about it. Seriously. It’s time to start considering all the options. Maddie Meyer/Getty Images Here’s a story: I was staying in Manhattan for the 2013 draft. After the event, around 1 a.m., I was writing in my hotel when I noticed that the room next to me was throwing a party. I walked into the hallway and realized that one of the players selected in the top 10 was staying next door. I realized the hotel was going to be full of these parties all night (the one on my floor went till 6 a.m.), so I went down to the lobby to see what other crazy things I could find. It was a mess of agents, women, and players either on the way in or on the way out. And then there was Otto Porter, sitting quietly off to the side, eating a large pizza with his parents and his agent. That was his draft party. This is a dude you can root for. This made the Derrick Williams–ish trail he cut from the top of the draft to the lower middle of the NBA all the more painful. He couldn’t stay healthy his first season, and when did he play, he look overwhelmed by … everything? He was too slow, he wasn’t strong enough, and he couldn’t shoot. These were not good signs. It continued like that through most of the 2015 regular season. Then the playoffs happened, and we all had our faces melted. Playing in space, with a smaller lineup — and also just playing, which he didn’t do much in the regular season — turned him into a different player. And if that’s where it would have ended, then it’d be a good story. Whatever, cool, Otto Porter can play in the NBA. But if last season’s playoffs were only the beginning … John Wall is about to become one of the 10 best players in the league this season. We know this. Bradley Beal is getting older and stronger, and he might improve even more than Wall. Marcin Gortat is the world’s truest Wizard, and he can hold things down in the post. With the team all set to go smaller around smart role players like Alan Anderson, Gary Neal, and Jared Dudley, the offense should look much better this season. John Wall in space should terrify opposing teams. It’s a decent plan. But if Otto Porter is going to start draining 3s and accidentally dribbling through Rafael Mineiro’s legs …  Remember that one week when the NBA Internet became obsessed with explaining how valuable Michael Kidd-Gilchrist is? Otto could have that kind of value in D.C. He wouldn’t be doing it with MKG-level defense, but if he turns into a weapon on offense, he’ll make the whole team so much harder to guard. And if he turns into a wing who can swing between the 3 and 4, and guard multiple spots while stretching the floor, well, those are currently some of the most valuable skills in basketball. Imagine an MKG-ish glue guy but on a team with two or three All-Stars. It may not happen, obviously. The Wiz could slide to the 6- or 7-seed this season, and Otto could just be a decent rotation player who’s capable of occasional flashes. That’s what he was during the playoffs. But let me take you inside my Gchat from the past seven days: “Did you see OTTO last night???” “I don’t want to talk about it. That wasn’t real. Too good to be true.” “Man, if he’s playing like that this year…” “He’s hitting 3s now??” “They may not miss Pierce? Is that possible?” “It’s preseason.” “Gotta admit, the spacing looks pretty great…” “Look, if Wall can make Rasual look great, Otto is easy.” “The East is wide open behind the Cavs…” I’m not saying that any of this is reasonable or rational, but that’s what makes it fun. This Wizards season was supposed to be a yearlong dream about next summer, but right now, October 2015, it’s every bit as fun to get delusional about the team D.C. already has. (See? Otto is working miracles already.)",2015-10-13T12:20:07+00:00,2015 NBA Preview,Sharp
172,We Need to Talk About Marcus Camby,"Earlier this week, someone tried to tell me that Rudy Gobert, in Year 2, was already as good as Marcus Camby in his prime, and I just about lost my mind. Gobert had a good two months, but come on, let’s take the hype down a notch. Camby could do everything, and he did it for more than a decade. Does no one remember how good he was? Do the ’99 Knicks mean nothing anymore? UMass? Nothing? It’s like there’s an entire generation out there and nobody’s walking around saying, “Damn, Marcus Camby was pretty solid.” It’s time to fix this. Camby was unstoppable in college. If you ever wondered what Anthony Davis would look like if he’d stayed in school, check out Camby’s junior year at UMass. He averaged 20 points, eight rebounds, and four blocks while playing in the largest T-shirt on the face of the earth. The poor souls of the Atlantic 10 didn’t stand a chance, and neither did anyone else in college basketball. He took John Calipari’s team to the Final Four. He was the best player the school had seen since Julius Erving. After his junior year, it was time for the NBA. Camby went no. 2 overall to the Raptors, and on draft night Rick Pitino said he should’ve gone no. 1 over Allen Iverson. In Toronto, Camby would link up with Damon Stoudamire, rock the dinosaur jersey, and become a franchise cornerstone. Then things got complicated. Camby suffered back and ankle injuries that slowed him down as a rookie, and midway through that first year, a scandal broke. Agents claimed they had provided cash, cars, and prostitutes to Camby while he was at UMass. The NCAA investigated, Camby admitted it was true, and that Final Four run was vacated. This was all a really big deal. As Sports Illustrated wrote in 1997, “Camby’s talent has never been questioned, but in light of the revelations, his character has.” Nine months later, after more injuries and a second straight year of losing, he was out of Toronto. Marcus Camby was born on March 22, 1974, and he grew up in Hartford, Connecticut. He was reborn on the 1998-99 Knicks. Now we need to talk about the 1998-99 Knicks. Keith Torrie/NY Daily News Archive via Getty Images That season began with the NBA lockout, a six-month nightmare for basketball fans and divorce lawyers alike. When the dust settled, Michael Jordan was gone, the All-Star Game was canceled, and the schedule had been cut to 50 games. The Knicks had one of the most expensive rosters in the league. Marcus Camby. Patrick Ewing. Allan Houston. Latrell Sprewell. Larry Johnson. Chris Childs. Charlie Ward. Chris Dudley.1 And, of course, ol’ Happy Times Harry himself, Jeff Van Gundy. Jeff Kowalsky/AFP/Getty Images The regular season was a mess. Ewing was ravaged by injuries, Sprewell missed games, and the roster had very little time to jell after the lockout. Eventually, the whole team began to look like a very expensive bad idea. As the New York Times sneered late in the year, “after seasons of using cash piles to facilitate trades and patch up mistakes, [then-GM Ernie] Grunfeld has helped turn an organization that once contended for a title into a money pit.” In a way, this Knicks season was the bridge between title contenders of the past and nightmares of the future. Some people blamed the offseason trade that had sent 35-year-old locker room leader Charles Oakley to the Raptors for Camby.2 “They dealt Charles Oakley,” ex-Knick Buck Williams told the Times, “and discounted chemistry. Oak sacrificed to make the team better, and he helped make Patrick’s life easier. And I’d say with Patrick, why get younger until he retires?” It took Ewing going for 27 and 19 against the Celtics just to clinch the 8-seed. Then the playoffs started. The team that had been a mess for months turned out to be AWESOME. Sprewell would tear through the lane at 150 mph and get to the rim at will. (During this same Camby-Gobert conversation earlier in the week, someone also compared Sprewell’s game to DeMar DeRozan’s. The numbers are remarkably similar. But no. This comparison is unacceptable. Sprewell was built differently. DeRozan isn’t out here driving straight through people’s chests on the way to an avalanche of and-1 layups. Sorry. Basketball-Reference will have to take a mulligan on this one.) Houston’s jumpers were the perfect complement to Sprewell’s screaming drives. Sure: Ewing was playing through pain every night, Johnson was beating people with mostly old-man strength by that point, and the $55 million the Knicks were spending on Ward and Childs would have been better spent on almost anything else. But with Houston and Sprewell and the others as role players, there was something there. And in the playoffs, it started to work. Because Camby made it work. In the playoffs, Camby gave the Knicks the bounce they’d been looking for all year. He came off the bench and ran teams ragged. This actually started late in the regular season against Miami, and it continued in the first round when the Knicks took down the 1-seed Heat.3 In the second round, Camby was driving from the top of the key and dunking all over Dikembe Mutombo. He dominated the Pacers in the Eastern Conference finals after Ewing partially tore his Achilles in Game 2. This was all years before net ratings and real plus/minus became religious doctrine among NBA personnel, but when Camby came off the bench, the Knicks became twice as fast on offense, and the defense only got better. Coming out of UMass, Camby was supposed to be a franchise big man around whom you could build for the next 15 years — like Ewing, basically. What happened instead was something like the precursor to Tyson Chandler’s career. Instead of an All-Star who could carry a team, he was just a killer role player who allowed teams to play at warp speed without missing a beat on defense. Today he’d get a max deal for this:  Chances are, you already know exactly how that playoff run ended. The Allan Houston shot against the Heat became a sweep against the Hawks, which became the four-point play, which became a Spurs title that will never be as cool as the team that played them. Camby spent a few more years in New York, then took his act to Denver before bouncing around a few more teams and quietly bowing out in 2013. He had his moments in each spot, but beyond the tortured release on his jumper, the ’99 Finals, and thousands of blocks, it’s easy to forget he existed. That’s what makes him so fun to remember.4 Mostly, though, we need to talk about Marcus Camby because Rudy Gobert could be as good and valuable as Camby was. He still needs to add the jumper with a horrifying release,5 but Gobert does most of the same things well, and the per-36 numbers are awfully similar. Gobert changed the Jazz at the end of last year the same way Camby changed the Knicks in the ’99 playoffs. Thinking about them reminded me why I love this sport. The players who basketball fans love to remember are not much different from the ones we’re watching today. One day we’ll remember today’s stars with the same irrational loyalty people have for the ’99 Knicks. This is the circle of basketball fan life. When we’re not freaking out about players in front of us, we’re yelling about players we used to watch. It’s pretty basic. It’s also the best. Anyway, NBA training camps open Monday. It’s time to start yelling about basketball again. Start with these Camby videos. 1.  2.  3.  4.6  5.  6.7  Next week we can start talking Gobert. This piece has been updated to correct the nature of the injury that Patrick Ewing suffered in 1999. It was a partially torn Achilles, not a torn ACL.",2015-09-25T13:59:51+00:00,NBA,Sharp
173,"Kam Chancellor, the Unstoppable Force vs. the Seahawks and the Immovable Precedent","It’s hard to name many football players who have earned more respect than Kam Chancellor over the past few years. In a sport that puts a premium on power, he straight-up flattens people multiple times a game. In a sport that worships toughness, he played with a bruised knee and torn MCL in last season’s Super Bowl. He had 10 tackles in that game, and Pete Carroll called his performance “super human.” Simply put, he’s turned himself into one of the best safeties in football and a charter member of one the most dominant secondaries in history. Now he wants a new contract. Almost every star player in the NFL deserves more money. The best players in the most profitable sport in America make about the same salary as Michael Kidd-Gilchrist. Their contracts are also almost never fully guaranteed, which is even more amazing considering how much risk they incur compared to other professional athletes. It’s a system that relies on renegotiated contracts to help correct market value and add security, especially later in deals. Dez Bryant signed for $70 million in July, and that was considered a triumphant victory for a receiver. He got Enes Kanter money, can you believe it? The entire league should hold out every year.

But Chancellor is in a tricky place. He still has three years left on his deal, and that’s too early to renegotiate. As a former fifth-round pick turned Pro Bowler, he’d been making league minimums when the Seahawks agreed to give him a four-year extension worth $28 million two years ago. It was the first big payday for one of Seattle’s young stars, and at the time it was considered a win for both sides. From there, he went back to wrecking people as a rule, the Seahawks won the Super Bowl, and everyone was happy, right up until about five weeks ago. That’s when Chancellor’s agent leaked news that his client wouldn’t be reporting to training camp without a reworked contract. This was after Chancellor spent the past two summers watching the Seahawks reward teammates like Bobby Wagner, K.J. Wright, Richard Sherman, Earl Thomas, Marshawn Lynch, and Russell Wilson, whose signing bonus alone is worth more than Chancellor’s entire extension. For their part, the Seahawks have spent the month planning to start second-year player Dion Bailey in his place, with veteran DeShawn Shead helping out as well. They also traded for Kelcie McCray, a safety from the Chiefs, as more insurance. Meanwhile, despite his absence, Chancellor’s still playing the role of the player who was voted a captain 12 months ago. “Oh, yeah, I get texts,” Shead said earlier in camp. “He still watches all the film. He’s still tuned in to everything. He will tell me ‘Shead, watch out for this. When you see this play you can play it faster.’ If I made a mistake on something he will tell me, let me know.” Now it’s Week 1, though. This is getting real. Pete Carroll made his weekly appearance on ESPN Radio over the weekend and said that even early-season struggles for the Seahawks wouldn’t change the negotiations. “Not really,” he said. “Everything’s pretty well-stated. He knows where we’re coming from, and we know where he’s coming from. So we just have to keep going and do what we need to do, and he has to do the same.” Seattle’s reportedly received trade offers for Chancellor, but the front office isn’t interested in talking to other teams. For now, the biggest question is whether Chancellor will continue to hold strong and risk forfeiting his first $267,000 game check by sitting out against the Rams. “We’ve communicated very clearly,” Carroll said. “I know where he’s coming from. He knows where we’re coming from, so that’s what’s going on. This is an important week to see where he is, so we’re ready to go about our business.” Pete Carroll: ""We're ready to go"" with Dion Bailey at strong safety Sun. at STL with Kam Chancellor's holdout seemingly endless #Seahawks — Gregg Bell (@gbellseattle) September 7, 2015  There are all kinds of places we could go from here, but let’s just go back to that first paragraph: In any kind of just sporting universe, Chancellor deserves whatever he wants. He’s definitely worth more than the $4.55 million he’s due to make in 2015. He’s as important to the Seahawks’ identity as anyone on the field. Earl Thomas is Bruce Banner, and Kam is Hulk.  Panthers running back Mike Tolbert is the closest thing you’ll come to watching a refrigerator run full speed. Now watch a safety knock that refrigerator sideways.  Even offensive lineman get humbled when they get too close.  I don’t think there’s any player in football who I’ve been more shameless about enjoying the past few years. He’s like a human smelling salt that reminds people every September why football can be awesome. He hits like Russell Westbrook dunks, and it trickles down to the whole team. All of that is what makes it so depressing to realize the Seahawks shouldn’t pay him. They can’t pay him. He’s reportedly looking to convert the next two years of his contract to a signing bonus, of which Danny Kelly of Field Gulls notes, “In other words, Kam wants the Seahawks [to] guarantee the next two years of his contract, and pay him for it up front.” It’s usually empty rhetoric when teams balk at renegotiating deals because of the message it would send to other players, but in this case it rings true. This is more survival tactic than negotiating tactic. Seattle’s already in the middle of a delicate balancing act trying to keep a core of superstars intact — signing Wagner and Wilson in July felt a little like a magic trick — but if the contracts that superstars do sign are rendered negotiable before they’re even halfway done, the whole thing becomes impossible. It won’t matter if the Seahawks struggle with Bailey starting at safety. No amount of leverage gained by Chancellor will make it worthwhile for the Seahawks to cede leverage to every other star on the roster. What we’re seeing instead is a situation where nobody is really wrong — Chancellor is right that he deserves more guarantees, and the Seahawks can’t afford to renegotiate every deal — and now everybody’s losing. Chancellor has the perfect team in the Seahawks, where he’s surrounded by players who hide his weaknesses and allow his strengths to wreak havoc. And the Seahawks have the perfect safety in Chancellor, a human knockout punch next to the suffocating coverage of Thomas and Sherman. “He just brings that menacing force,” Sherman said last year. “We’re a bunch of wild dogs, and a pack of wild dogs is pretty dangerous. But a lion running with a pack of wild dogs … that’s something.” Here’s to selfishly hoping that Chancellor will report later this week and wait until next summer to resume this fight. Maybe the players expecting him to miss the entire season will seem melodramatic by Sunday. Until that happens, the Seahawks are missing a team captain, and the rest of us will be left missing a player who personifies most of what makes football great. There’s no great insight into NFL business here, except that sometimes it sucks. Now Kam Chancellor personifies that, too.",2015-09-08T13:41:22+00:00,2015 NFL Preview,Sharp
174,Welcome to Football’s Pro Wrestling Era,"Thursday night. Foxborough. Brady. Belichick. Roger Goodell in hiding. NBC. Prime time. The most ridiculous sport on earth is BACK. Allow me to be the 8,000th person to predict that tonight’s game will have some of the highest ratings in history, precisely because of how disastrously the NFL handled this offseason. As you know, this is the fundamental genius of the NFL’s booming business: The more everyone yells about what a mess this sport has become, the closer we watch to see what happens next and the richer the league gets. I can’t wait to be part of it all over again, and that isn’t sarcasm. The rest of our entertainment options are too boring, and if we’re going to be inundated with NFL news all year round, we might as well have some highlights sprinkled in, as well. I’ve already got plans to watch games with three different sets of friends in Week 1. It’ll be great. As for the central absurdity of the NFL, I’ve been trying to process all that for the better part of the past five years. Every new season starts with me talking myself in circles, trying to justify the balance between the obviously unhealthy aspects of pro football and the equally obvious reality that I’m going to keep watching anyway. But that’s become a futile, endless back-and-forth. Plus, if this offseason proved anything, it’s that the NFL doesn’t deserve to be taken that seriously. ??? This isn’t even really a sport anymore. Games are just a pretext for a never-ending cycle of scandals that are both unbelievable and not all that surprising. One week, according to police, it’s a superstar in a Bentley going 143 mph in a police chase that involves a gun, weed, and a 12-year-old kid. The next, according to an arrest report, it’s a coach on vacation, threatening to kill someone’s family over beach chairs. Then it’s a wife of a team GM going on Twitter to accost a local reporter, and then it’s a judge mocking the league’s idea of justice in federal court. Every new breaking-news item is either infuriating or disturbing or hilarious, and sometimes it’s all of the above. The NFL is the sports answer to Donald Trump’s presidential campaign. It’s tempting to pin the state of this league on Goodell. He makes it so, so easy. He’s the elephant in the room, and the bull in the china shop, and the dead horse that somehow keeps finding new ways to get beaten. I don’t know if there’s ever been a public figure who’s been this utterly charmless. On Mike & Mike this week, they asked him why he was skipping tonight’s season opener. Rather than showing an ounce of self-deprecating humor — “I think we can all agree that’s not a great idea,” etc. — or at least pointing out that his presence would be a distraction, he explained that he’d been to New England twice during last year’s playoffs, and that’s why he won’t be there tonight. It was amazing. Under his watch, the NFL has gone from the most popular game in America to a league determined to test the limits of its popularity about once a month. Goodell operates with a combination of arrogance and incompetence that will be his legacy. Deflategate was a perfect case study: He didn’t just overstep his power once the news broke; his office permitted the Colts to essentially run a sting operation in an NFL playoff game to create that scandal in the first place. So, sure, Goodell deserves some blame. But then … Goodell didn’t go on Twitter and accuse a reporter of trading sexual favors for scoops. Goodell didn’t get arrested in a Bentley with a gun, weed, and a 12-year-old. And Goodell didn’t invent CTE. The bigger problem is that pro football isn’t built to handle life amid 21st-century media without looking like the biggest carnival that American sports has to offer. It fosters a crazed culture and inspires crazy news, all while ignoring crazy consequences for even its best players. It’s probably always been this way, but the general recklessness has become less socially acceptable as the league’s popularity and exposure has made it impossible to hide the truth. Whether the latest news makes you outraged or not, it makes it impossible for anyone to buy into whatever grand ideals this sport is selling. Whereas the rise of the Internet has made a league like the NBA more accessible and rendered its stars more enjoyable than ever, today’s media landscape does the opposite for football. The league still wants to sell us the NFL Films mythology, but actual football news debunks that on a daily basis. Blame Goodell all you want, but his rise to power coincided with the rise of new media. Sometime soon, everyone will get their wish and he will move on. Will the NFL suddenly become a league we can all celebrate? ??? Mike Lawrie/Getty Images Of course, everyone will still watch. I’ll write about the NFL all year, fans will continue reading about it, and this will continue indefinitely. No matter what happens, the TV contracts are signed and the ratings are still worlds better than anything else on TV. The foundation of this league is stronger than ever. Enjoying something isn’t the same as respecting it, though, and strength is a little different than health. Football players prove that better than anyone. The reality of the game changes people, and after five years of year-round scandals, it’s changed the way I follow it. Football today feels like a nationally televised version of boxing. No matter how sketchy the context or characters become, people will tune in. You can’t beat the experience of watching a big-time fight with friends and enjoying all the insanity that comes with it. The gambling, the trash talk, the anticipation, the characters — it’s worth scheduling a night around. But not many people are still tuning in to pay respect to the sweet science. Even players understand this. “I think we’re talking about a different NFL now,” Browns Pro Bowler Joe Thomas said in August. “Before it was more about the game. Now it’s such an entertainment business. … It’s turning into the WWE really.” Right. This is boxing’s stakes with pro wrestling story lines. The realities of the NFL and the media that cover it will make it impossible to respect this sport in the 21st century. The smarter move is to just enjoy the chaos: It took five days after Deflategate for the NFL and the Patriots to be embarrassed all over again. In a few weeks or months it will be something else, with more calls for Goodell’s job, more think pieces, more everything. Personally, I want Tom Brady to throw for 600 yards tonight, and then continue that pace all year. Whether or not he’s innocent, nothing would make me happier than him following this ridiculous summer with another Super Bowl run. Because at this point, why not? Let’s see how crazy this gets.",2015-09-10T11:56:50+00:00,NFL,Sharp
175,Who Are the Most Interesting Quarterbacks in the NFL?,"We know what we’re getting with most of the quarterbacks around the NFL. Either they’re not very good (Josh McCown, RG3, Brian Hoyer, Alex Smith), they’re very good but predictable (Peyton Manning, Brees, Rivers, Roethlisberger, Romo, Ryan, Flacco, Wilson), or they’re allegedly good but inevitably disappointing (I refuse to ever believe the Ryan Tannehill hype; Andy Dalton probably belongs in the first category). When the most important players on the field are this predictable, it’s easy to tune out. This is how I am during most Broncos games, for example. I know what Manning’s going to do, so I don’t need to watch closely to see him audible 800 times and then throw a 15-yard touchdown pass to Demaryius Thomas. Or Drew Brees — I’ve seen him scramble around the pocket and improvise his way into 35-yard bombs for the past decade. I can afford to miss one or two of those plays without ever really missing anything. Most quarterbacks are living out some variation of the same season every year. What follows is the opposite. Let’s run down the most watchable quarterbacks in football right now. This isn’t about who’s best. These are the quarterbacks who will make me stop everything to pay attention when they’re on my television. But sure, let’s start with the best. Not human.  He’s the closest thing the NFL has to Steph Curry — gorgeous to watch, makes plays that are borderline impossible to explain, and demoralizing for anyone with the misfortune of rooting against him. But this season, there’s a twist. More 2015 NFL PreviewIt's almost here. For everything you need to know about the new season, follow all of Grantland's coverage.

The Jordy Nelson injury was a crushing blow for anyone invested in Green Bay’s success, and Rodgers sounded more miserable than anyone. But after we got done cursing the injury gods and/or preseason football, a silver lining emerged: Rodgers is already the best player in football, and now we get to see him tested like never before. Is he good enough to make this work anyway? What happens if he turns Davante Adams into a superstar? Is Randall Cobb about to have 150 catches? Do the Packers just win 12 games by default, as long as they have the best player in football? Under different circumstances, another flawless Rodgers season would’ve been too predictable to include on this list. Now, the most gifted quarterback I’ve ever seen has an added degree of difficulty. Imagine taking away Marvin Harrison from Manning during the peak Colts years. That’s what’s happening here. It either means we’ll watch Rodgers look suspiciously mortal for a year, orrrrr … it will make it even more amazing when he throws for 4,500 yards anyway. Me before the draft: He was throwing to wide-open receivers in Oregon’s system. The Pac-12 defenses he played against were almost all terrible. When he played against a great defense in the national championship, he fell apart. That’s how the NFL will be if he doesn’t go to the Eagles. Also, he has the charisma of a doorknob, and his greatest asset (athleticism) guarantees he’ll be hurt for at least a few weeks every season. Mariota made it look like he's been throwing for 35 yards (on the run!) in the NFL for years. #STLvsTEN http://t.co/6doyVWIq7g — NFL (@NFL) August 24, 2015  Me after watching that highlight: Yeah, OK, let’s watch the Titans this year. Let’s see where this goes. Whatever you think about Chip Kelly the GM, it says a lot about Chip Kelly the coach that we are even thinking about the sixth time being the charm for the Sam Bradford Revolution. And hey, it might be! Take any frustrating, could-be star quarterback in the league, add “in Chip Kelly’s offense,” and the player instantly becomes twice as attractive. RG3? Probably hopeless in D.C., but RG3 in Chip Kelly’s offense could be fun. Johnny Manziel in Chip Kelly’s offense? Watch out. Colin Kaepernick? Teddy Bridgewater? Marcus Mariota? Put him with Chip Kelly, and …  Everyone looks better in the shadow of Chip’s visor, following those play-cards. For Bradford’s part, if he can stay healthy, he’s accurate enough to be dangerous in this offense. I’m not saying that because it’s true, but because it’s a thing that all smart football fans are required to say before this season. Nobody has any idea, really. Why did the Eagles bet their immediate future on Sam Bradford? Let’s all find out together! Jason Miller/Getty Images There is a strong possibility that all the off-the-field scandals are irrelevant, and it turns out Johnny Football is just too small to ever be a successful quarterback in the NFL. It may not matter that he went to rehab and abandoned the money sign. He is listed at 6-foot, just like Brees, but when he’s surrounded by defensive linemen and scurrying around for dear life, he really feels more like Doug Flutie. He takes too many chances, he’s not quite fast enough to elude the defense, and it’s not a good sign when every big play feels like a miracle. I know all of this. I understand it’s probably time to accept reality. That Bengals game last year is a tough memory to shake. But … maybe?  Maybe???  I’m sorry, but I will never give up hope with Johnny Manziel. This must be how the Tebow cult feels watching the fourth quarter of preseason Eagles games. In my heart, I will always believe. He inherited a world of insanity almost overnight, and he was such an unrepentant shithead that his dedication to craft will remain awe-inspiring for a lifetime. And when he plays well, he’s still as exciting as any player in football. The Browns have a decent supporting cast, particularly if Terrance West and Isaiah Crowell can stay healthy, and Josh McCown is the most benchable quarterback in football. The stage is set. Expectations have never been more reasonable. Manziel has already lived several seasons’ worth of Ballers story arcs, and now I just want to watch him try to make this work. Let’s pause here to go through the toughest omissions from this list. And … that’s about it. Jay Cutler? Robert Mays had a wonderful look at the Cutler era this week, and it ends on the perfect note: This isn’t over. It’s never over. Bears fans are talking themselves into Cutler as we speak. He is always just good enough to trick people into believing that this year could be different.  Cutler is here because he’s the worst good quarterback I’ve ever seen. His body language makes me laugh out loud. He makes decisions so indefensible and inexplicable that the only reasonable conclusion is that he stopped caring five years ago. He makes me smile more than any other quarterback in football. His entire existence is a prank played on people who take pro athletes too seriously. This is the quarterback who really does provoke a mutiny on the field. He really did shove his offensive lineman on national TV. When Martellus Bennett was asked about Cutler’s leadership skills this offseason, he said, “Why does everyone always assume the quarterback is the leader?” He was benched for Jimmy Clausen. Nobody should be able to recover from that, but of course Cutler did. I can’t wait to watch him throw his first off-the-back-foot interception this year, before slumping his shoulders over to the sideline. Jay Cutler is the super-bacteria version of Jeff George, and as his career winds down, everyone should be cherishing these memories. Andy Lyons/Getty Images This is how Colts games have felt for the past two years: “OK, Andrew Luck. Here we go.” [Throws into triple coverage, gets picked.] [Throws third-down pass into the ground, 4 yards in front of his receiver’s feet.] “Are we …” [Colts go three-and-out on the next three possessions.] [First-down pass hits linebacker in the back of the head.] “Are we sure Andrew Luck is that good?” [Threads 40-yard touchdown pass to the back of the end zone on third-and-15.] “Ahhhhh. OK. Got it.”
 I’m glad it’s been this way for the first few years. It’s made his games more exciting than the Colts ever were when Manning was doing his OCD savant routine. For a quarterback who is considered the heir apparent to the blue bloods of the past 15 years, Luck doesn’t exactly have polish yet. Luck looks fallible for most of the game, which makes his superhero plays even more impressive. That win against the Chiefs was a microcosm of the whole Andrew Luck Experience. He was just ordinary enough through the first half to set the stage for one of the most memorable playoff comebacks in history. Now, it’s Year 4. Given the hype that he’s gotten the past few years, it’s fair to start asking: When does he stop looking ordinary at all? This year should be a fun test. With Andre Johnson, T.Y. Hilton, Donte Moncrief, Duron Carter, and Phillip Dorsett, he’s got more options than ever. He’s already more fun to root for than anybody else. Let’s see if Luck can go scorched-earth now. Cliff McBride/Getty Images There’s off-field Jameis, and there’s on-field Jameis. There’s lots to be said about how one does or should affect the other, but for our purposes, we’re talking about Jameis simply as a quarterback on a team that desperately needs a good one. Bucs optimism has become an annual tradition at Grantland. It’s what we do. And then the Bucs fall apart by October. It’s what they do. But just for the record, all of those broken dreams from the past few years came with a train wreck playing under center. Look at what the Bucs were dealing with in Week 1 a year ago:  But with Jameis? The Bucs could be pretty great if Jameis can be good. They have stars on defense (Lavonte David, Kwon Alexander, Gerald McCoy, Alterraun Verner), on offense (Doug Martin, Vincent Jackson, Mike Evans), and they even have the Barnwell co-sign. If their quarterback is decent, this team is dangerous. 3 defenders. 1 WR. The degree of difficulty on this seam pass? It's up there.

Now watch @Jaboowins work. http://t.co/SPoaWKWMo4 — NFL (@NFL) August 25, 2015  It will make every Tampa Bay series twice as exciting, because we’re still not sure exactly what’s there with Winston. He makes horrible decisions, throws wobbly passes into traffic that make you second-guess his future, and then he’ll throw a perfect strike up the seam for a 20-yard first down. It was like this at Florida State. It will be like this at Tampa Bay.  There will definitely come a time when he settles comfortably into one role or the other — rich man’s Geno Smith or poor man’s Andrew Luck — but until then, every drive is an adventure. He could have a 5-11 season, or he could lead the Bucs to the playoffs. Here we go.  And then, the most obvious choice on the board.  HERE WE GO.

176,Draymond Green and Hassan Whiteside Are Here to Make You Miss the NBA,"Here is a very quick update from the NBA world. In the past 24 hours, there has been a war between Draymond Green and Hassan Whiteside. It began with #factsonly. Small ball only works on centers  that can't score #factsonly I wish you would put Someone that 6'6 on me #careerhigh #highschooldays — Hassan Whiteside (@youngwhiteside) August 26, 2015  Sure, whatever, cool thought. But then, as a small-ball ambassador and world champion instigator, Draymond Green felt compelled to fact-check Whiteside’s facts.  This is why Draymond is great. Of course he responded. You may have been lying awake, tossing and turning your way through an August without the NBA, wondering whether Draymond Green is still talking shit in these trying months. The answer is yes. Basketball may take a month or two off, but Draymond’s shit-talking never sleeps. He was waiting all summer for someone to tweet about small ball. After a few hours, Whiteside doubled down by talking double-teams. 2 dribbles in the post they going to cry for a double team FOH  just watch go small ball #lightdoubledouble #getyourweightup #dontflop ??? — Hassan Whiteside (@youngwhiteside) August 26, 2015  Sidenote to all this: Whiteside is acting like he’s an All-Star, but he’s coming off a season during which he averaged 12 and 10, got suspended and fined at least $40,000, and had teammates openly wonder if he would ever be reliable enough to play pro basketball. #Factsonly. I love the NBA. And obviously, Draymond couldn’t let it slide. He added an Instagram, just in case anyone forgot the Warriors are world champions.  ??????????? A post shared by Draymond Green (@money23green) on Aug 25, 2015 at 8:51pm PDT Then this morning, he finished the discussion.  The tweets were deleted Wednesday afternoon, but the damage was done. The moral of this story is that Draymond is enjoying his summer, while Pat Riley making Whiteside a building block for the future is still an amazing gamble that could go a lot of different directions. Meanwhile, Nick Young was hanging out with a kangaroo, Matt Barnes was hashtagged to death by Rihanna (RIP), Carmelo Anthony and his wife responded to rumors of infidelity with a duet on Instagram, and Russell Westbrook was at a Taylor Swift concert.

177,RG3 and the Dumbest Team in Football,"I don’t know if I’ve ever seen a head coach be as openly hostile to a starting quarterback as Jay Gruden was toward Robert Griffin III in D.C. last year. In the final month of the season, it seemed like there was always another passive-aggressive shot being made. It was all pretty unprofessional, like a Coors Light commercial remixed with Facebook comments. And almost all the fans were on Gruden’s side! The media was just as bad. Even his teammates turned on him. Remember DeSean Jackson’s “basic people” Instagram? This was how the whole year went. Gruden says it's important to get a lead so griffin doesn't have to do a lot of dropback passing and defense reading. — Mike Jones (@MikeJonesWaPo) December 16, 2014  So … MAYBE THIS TIME WILL BE DIFFERENT. Ouch again. https://t.co/jtuTM2DFdT — Alex Kennedy (@AlexKennedyNBA) August 21, 2015  Can't catch a break https://t.co/gMynNsbhCu — Michael Smith (@michaelsmith) August 21, 2015  #75 is clearly a federal informant https://t.co/fdIqg0dW6X — W.E.B.B.I.E DuBois (@fivefifths) August 21, 2015  This is what the most dysfunctional team in the league looks like. Drink it in. We started this week with RG3 telling a local reporter that he thinks he’s the best quarterback in the league. That led to predictable cackling across the NFL media and the Internet. But then the cackling led to others defending him, arguing he was taken out of context for clickbait. Even RG3 said that. Maybe it’s true. But as someone who’s lived among D.C. sports fans for RG3’s entire time with the Redskins — and spent most of that time defending him — I’d like to point out that Griffin definitely deserves some of the blame here. It’s OK to ask him not to say something that might get taken out of context and turned into a national controversy. I get the “all competitors have to think they’re the best” angle to this, but at some point you just sound like a crazy person. It would be like Sam Bradford calling himself the best quarterback in the league. If someone like Bradford said that, no matter the context, wouldn’t it get picked up by every outlet in the media? That’s not clickbait. That’s, “Whoa, listen to this person who clearly doesn’t understand what ‘best’ means.” Griffin’s critics may have been unfair, but he doesn’t make himself easy to defend. That would be the entire RG3 era in one sentence — except that it doesn’t quite do justice to how much of a disaster the Redskins have been this entire time. Things weren’t much better institutionally when he was good, except that in 2012, RG3 was so good that nothing else mattered.
 He would glide through defenses like they were all going half-speed, he threw perfect deep balls to Pierre Garcon, he had Alfred Morris as the perfect sidekick, and it made football in D.C. more fun than it’s ever been in my lifetime. I’m a Cowboys fan, and I couldn’t even be upset when RG3 came in and embarrassed them on Thanksgiving. It was too much fun to get mad. Now Griffin’s been hurt for two years straight. He’s trying to change his game and adjust to his own post-injury limits, but the usual Washington dysfunction just compounds the problems. It’s all such a mess. Kirk Cousins is doing a weekly guest spot on the radio, and hosts are teasing it as a possible interview with the starting quarterback. The offensive line is a nightmare. There are no tight ends anymore, and Jackson is already hurt. Gruden’s offense wasn’t even that great in Cincinnati, with real talent, but it looks even more hopeless now. The local media is ready to tear him down for all of this, and even ex-Redskins have said as much. So, we all just have to watch one of the most electrifying rookie quarterbacks the NFL’s ever seen get run further and further into the ground. I’m not exaggerating when I say this is one of the most depressing sports stories of my lifetime. This might be the saddest thumbs up I've ever seen: pic.twitter.com/Gfhu6qvzEb — Jimmy Kempski (@JimmyKempski) August 21, 2015  After false reports on the team-sponsored broadcast (of course), preseason game no. 2 ultimately ended with a concussion that will keep Griffin out indefinitely. It should be more surprising that RG3 stayed in the game as long as he did last night — and some people are upset — but given how little Gruden seems to think of his starting quarterback, it’s par for the course. There will be no special rules for RG3 this year, and every endorsement will be more tepid than the last. If there are still people in D.C. who think Griffin is a prized asset worth protecting at all costs, they do not work for the Redskins coaching staff. If anything, it’s surprising they’re not running naked bootlegs every play to see if someone will solve this problem for them. Jay Gruden on RGIII: ""I would imagine, depending on how long he is out, he is still going to be our starter."" Strong. http://t.co/LBxVSAetyV — Dan Steinberg (@dcsportsbog) August 21, 2015  I just can’t believe that Washington is going to do this all over again for the next four months. Please, just trade him. Bench him. Give him the Terrell-Owens-on-the-Eagles treatment where he’s paid to be away from the team. Whatever. It’s time for this story to end before it gets any more miserable. I don’t know if RG3 can succeed anywhere else, but he won’t succeed in D.C. That became obvious last night. RG3 deserves some of the blame, sure. He’s been tone-deaf, stubborn, and insecure. But he’s also not healthy. He was put in an offense early on that never asked him to evolve and left him exposed to injuries. Those problems were then compounded by the dumbest organization in the league. I mean, for god’s sake, this team almost definitely played him on a blown ACL. It ignored the advice of the best sports surgeon in the country and lied about it. And he’ll probably never be the same. Griffin is a shell of himself now. Blame whoever you want, but when you look at how all of this happened, go back to the beginning and remember exactly who we’re talking about: The March night when the Redskins agreed to send three first-round picks and a second-round pick to St. Louis for the right to go up to No. 2 in the draft and select Robert Griffin III, Washington’s brain trust celebrated in a style that was beyond grand. Redskins owner Daniel Snyder boarded his private plane with general manager Bruce Allen and head coach Mike Shanahan, and the men flew to the Bahamas to celebrate their franchise-altering acquisition. The men spent the weekend toasting their trade, playing golf and celebrating a deal that neither Cleveland nor Miami could get done. Did RG3 ever really have a chance?",2015-08-21T12:15:25+00:00,NFL,Sharp
178,"The Bucks, the Federal Government, and a Billion-Dollar Question","Public financing for stadiums is having a bit of a moment right now. Charlie Pierce did a great job highlighting the issues surrounding the Milwaukee Bucks’ proposed arena deal last week on Grantland. And this weekend, the New York Times ran an article highlighting the fraught economic situation in Wisconsin. The article begins by taking us back and discussing how the NBA threatened to move the Bucks to Las Vegas or Seattle if the team’s owners couldn’t come to terms on a publicly financed arena deal. It reminds us of the stakes (“If economists left and right share any single view, however, it’s that local and state governments should eliminate subsidies to arenas and stadiums”) and the context (“From start to desultory end, Milwaukee offered a case study in all that is wrong with our arena-shakedown age”). And then, in granular detail, writer Michael Powell details the failed grassroots opposition to the arena and the eventual triumph of Bucks ownership, whose pledges of loyalty last year turned into a $500 million stadium this year. While one of the Bucks owners oversees a mortgage company that once owned abandoned foreclosed homes on one side of town, on the other side, the city (along with the state and county) will pay hundreds of millions for a stadium. Read the whole thing. With a combination of reporting and bone-dry sarcasm, it’s one of the most damning indictments of stadium subsidies you’ll find anywhere. But like most of the damning indictments of stadium subsidies, we never get to the real problem, or the most realistic way to solve it. POPULOUS/KNTB/EUA Don’t blame the owners of the Bucks. This is a tough ask, I know. It’s easy to look at billionaire hedge fund managers like Wesley Edens and Marc Lasry — who pressure Milwaukee officials while their lending companies foreclose on homes elsewhere in the city — and gawk at the audacity and hypocrisy on display. But this is how professional sports operate, and it’s been like this for decades. Owners aren’t crazy for demanding local money to help build a stadium; they’d be crazy not to do it. If cash-printing franchises like the Yankees and Cowboys are building stadiums with massive handouts from local governments, why should anyone expect the owners of the Milwaukee Bucks to adhere to a higher moral obligation? Teams have real leverage. There are a fixed number of franchises in every sport, demand outstrips supply, and leagues are quick to cosign relocation threats, because it helps establish public funding as the standard model for everyone. That same model helps ensure that cities will continue having these problems, too. As long as teams don’t own stadiums, it makes it even easier to threaten relocation again a decade or two down the line — it’s not like the owners would be abandoning a stadium that they spent hundreds of millions to build. And so the cycle continues. In every sport, every year. It comes down to a case of idealism vs. realism. In a vacuum, it’s easy to downplay the value of new stadiums to local economies. It’s harder to quantify the vacuum left behind when one of these teams leaves town for a new home that will pay to attract them. It’s why the Bucks stadium deal ultimately had bipartisan support among local politicians. Cities and states have a choice of either participating in the pro sports business or watching it go elsewhere. Supporting billionaires may look bad, but losing a billion-dollar corporation and the national relevance that comes with it isn’t necessarily a better alternative. So, somewhere between reading about the billionaire businessmen playing a game that’s rigged in their favor and the state politicians who are left choosing between two bad options, a question occurred to me. Isn’t this what the federal government is for? If there’s interstate commerce that wreaks havoc on state and local governments as a rule, shouldn’t Congress step in to legislate the business back to sanity? Even a local politician who helped craft the Bucks stadium deal admitted to the Times, “If Congress considered a law that would prevent any public financing for sports stadiums, I would support that.” The most productive solution to date emerged without much fanfare earlier this year, buried in the 2016 budget proposal that the Obama administration presented to Congress. As the Wall Street Journal reported in March, the budget included a proposed ban on using tax-exempt municipal bonds to fund stadium projects. This is the way almost all cities have paid for stadiums over the past few decades. The Minnesota Vikings, for instance, are using $468 million in bonds to build what will be a billion-dollar stadium. The $250 million that’s going to the Bucks is composed of “$55 million in state bonds; $47 million from the city of Milwaukee; $55 million in bonds from Milwaukee County and $93 million in bonds from Wisconsin Center District,” according to Bloomberg. In a separate look at the issue, in 2012, Bloomberg calculated that $17 billion of tax-exempt bonds have been issued for stadiums since 1986, costing federal taxpayers about $4 billion in subsidies to bondholders over the lifetime of the debt. Saving that money is obviously one benefit for the federal government, but the real imperative should be saving local and state governments from themselves and all the shakedowns that have become standard in pro sports. If local governments can’t be trusted to stop offering welfare to billionaire owners, the federal government can take away the tools they use to make those payments. Almost as soon as President Obama’s budget proposal was released, it was loudly dismissed by congressional Republicans. This isn’t surprising: Modern presidential budget proposals are mostly symbolic and not presented with any real notion they’ll get passed. But the municipal bond restriction quietly baked into the budget still makes sense. And given the money that both Republican and Democratic state governments are expected to raise for pro sports, there’s no reason it shouldn’t have bipartisan support in Congress. Billionaire owners don’t deserve public handouts to subsidize their investments. When they buy into pro sports, owners inherit teams that appreciate in value by hundreds of millions of dollars every decade, with TV rights skyrocketing and all kinds of ancillary revenue streams springing from their investment. In exchange for those benefits, it’s fair to ask them to invest in infrastructure and assume some of the risk. It’s how the business should work. Absent federal regulation, though, it’s naive to expect anyone involved to behave any differently from what just happened in Milwaukee. These scenarios feel outrageous and inexplicable, but they are also close to inevitable. There’s too much money on the line to expect charity from owners, and there’s too much civic pride and political capital on the line to expect local politicians to take a hard stance and send teams elsewhere. It just seems like we’ve been focusing our energy in the wrong places with this issue. Any time a team asks for public help building a new stadium, we point to the net worth of the owners in question, but not the 30 years of precedent for publicly funded stadiums that have already been built. Maybe raising awareness about these shameless stadium deals will make it harder to sell them politically, but that didn’t work in Milwaukee, and in Missouri the governor and the St. Louis Rams just skirted a public vote altogether on $400 million of proposed funding for a new stadium. At some point, it’s time to start asking why Congress allows this to happen to a new city every year. Whether it’s banning bonds from being used in these deals or some other kind of intervention, this is the only step that could really change things. In the meantime, demonizing owners or blaming local politicians doesn’t tell the full story. The Bucks’ owners may not be the bleeding-heart saviors they were advertised as last year, but they’re also not the blackhearted shakedown artists you’re hearing about now. Their stadium deal didn’t game the system; that is the system. If you want to get outraged at anyone, start with the people who can change it.",2015-08-19T10:29:35+00:00,NBA,Sharp
179,"Who’s That Guy? The Colts’ Duron Carter, the Most Intriguing Rookie in Football","The most intriguing rookie in the NFL might be a guy who wasn’t even drafted. He’s definitely the rookie I’m most excited to watch. When I heard Duron Carter’s name mentioned last week, I remembered the hype that surrounded him as a high school player. It wasn’t long before I had fallen into a wormhole researching what has happened to him since his prep days. Let’s all get caught up together now. Who Is He? Duron Carter, 6-foot-5, 206-pound receiver for the Colts. Where Is He From? Fort Lauderdale, Florida. You Might Know Him From: He is football Hall of Famer Cris Carter’s son, and he was a high school All-American who initially went to Ohio State. You Might Not Know Him Because: After playing in every game at Ohio State as a true freshman in 2009, Carter was put on academic probation for the bowl game, and ultimately left the school. He transferred to community college and then to Alabama, and after a year on the scout team, his grades once again cost him a spot on the field. He declared for the draft in 2013, but went undrafted. Then he went to Canada, before finally signing with the Colts back in February. How Old Is He? 24. How Does He Respond at the Moment of Truth? Matt Hasselbeck on Duron Carter: “He makes catches at the moment of truth.”

It is actually crazier to think aliens don't exist, than to believe they do — Duron Carter (@DC_CHILLIN_8) May 25, 2015  So What Happened in College? Cayden Cochran, his former teammate at Coffeyville Community College, said of Carter on Twitter before the 2013 draft: “the most lazy, whiny & non-work ethic player the nfl has ever seen … Horrible person & will be a complete cancer to any team on the board.” But then, guess who’s not in the NFL right now? My man Cayden Cochran! His dad Cris said in 2013, “He. Just. Hates. (Bleeping). School.” Maybe that’s it. I was looking for redder flags than that when I started reading about him this week, because bad grades and maturity issues shouldn’t have been enough for teams to just to give up on someone with his size. Whatever it was, after a suspension for “undisclosed reasons” at Alabama and the NCAA denying him a waiver at Florida Atlantic, he was done. And while the struggles at Bama may trouble some, the GM of the Montreal Alouettes played for Nick Saban (at Michigan State) and several other coaches on the Crimson Tide staff, and they are the ones who recommended Carter for the CFL. He was called up from the practice squad after five games in 2013, and had 49 catches, 909 yards, and five touchdowns in 11 games. “I wouldn’t have taken a chance on me either,” Carter told Yahoo Sports back in December. “I would say I wasn’t ready to come out. I just had no idea what it took and what it meant to be a professional athlete at all. I feel like I have started to accomplish that in Montreal.” Now he’s in Indianapolis. Have People Been Buzzing? Oh, so much buzzing. Colts OC Pep Hamilton on Duron Carter, Cris' son: ""Every day he makes a play that makes you say 'Wow'."" — Albert Breer (@AlbertBreer) August 5, 2015  Colts said Duron Carter's Friday ""might be the best day we’ve seen from a Colts player after a week in Anderson.""

Hilton, and Andre Johnson. He’s still competing for a roster spot with last year’s third-round pick, Donte Moncrief, and this year’s first-round pick (and his former high school teammate), Phillip Dorsett, but it sounds like he’s got a higher ceiling than either of them, and in Indianapolis, he’d be surrounded by the right pieces to help him deliver. ??? All of this is outrageously premature, obviously. But it’s August — everything is outrageously premature. Would you rather watch Amari Cooper get lost with the Raiders, or Cris Carter’s undrafted son go from the CFL to terrorizing people with Andrew Luck? It’s popular to call the NFL a meritocracy and assume that talent always wins out, the best players triumph, and so on. That idea’s misleading — surroundings and opportunity are crucial to success in the NFL, or anywhere else — but I can understand why it gets repeated over and over again. Players like Duron Carter are why. This is how the league works. For all the guys who hit the NFL as first-rounders destined for big things and then deliver on the hype, there’s always a handful of players who come out of nowhere to be just as important. Whether it’s Antonio Brown (Central Michigan, sixth round) or Cameron Wake (Penn State, undrafted), we see these players every year. Think of Hassan Whiteside appearing out of thin air for the Miami Heat last season, and how crazy that was for the NBA. In the NFL, that happens almost as a matter of course. Pedigree is irrelevant for guys who are just an extra fraction more gifted than the most gifted athletes on the planet. Doesn’t it seem like Duron Carter could become one of those guys? ?World Worst Kept Secret ? — Duron Carter (@DC_CHILLIN_8) August 11, 2015  He’s got the size to create problems immediately, and playing next to Luck puts him in a better situation than just about any young receiver in the league.

180,Sorry You’re Working Today: NFL Wild-Card Weekend Picks,"New Year’s Day is my own personal Groundhog Day — I’m always hungover, I’m always making resolutions that I never end up keeping, and I’m always losing college football wagers that never should have been made because I don’t follow college football closely enough. This week, I mixed it up by leaning on the advice of Grantland’s Mallory Rubin, our office guru for the following topics: best and worst cereals, best and worst Popchips flavors, Instagram accounts solely devoted to cat pictures, hardcore nerd-it-up baseball conversations, and all things college football. Here’s how that email chain played out: Me: “Who am I betting on in this college playoff?” Mallory: “I hope you can feel Nick Saban’s smoldering glare from across the electronic abyss. BAMA. Always Bama.” And then: Mallory: “(Alabama beats Ohio State. Florida State … shudder … beats Oregon. Alabama beats Florida State to restore order to the universe. Alabama gives Nick Saban another raise to avoid the indignity of a Big Ten coach making more money than an SEC coach. And then the 49ers hire Lane Kiffin.)” I won’t show you the third email in which she raved about FSU’s “juju.” But that ended up being my single worst two-team teaser ever — it’s almost like I single-handedly swung Mallory’s college football juju just by asking for her gambling advice. I watched every minute of both games, came away loving the new playoff system even as I hemorrhaged money, and thought Jameis Winston lost that game because HE’S A LIAR AND AN ALCOHOLIC! (Just kidding. That was my audition for a First Take guest-host gig.) Still, this was seven hours well spent because (a) the Bama-OSU game was legitimately terrific, and (b) how many times do you get to scout the top two NFL draft picks going head-to-head in a big game? Some disclaimers: Oregon’s crazy pace makes it semi-impossible to evaluate Marcus Mariota … Winston’s receivers betrayed him with those drops and fumbles … Mariota carries himself like the real-life Lance Harbor, a.k.a. the Handsome, Humble, Soft-Spoken QB Who Almost Seems Too Good To Be True … Winston’s coach clearly scolded him as things were falling apart and told him to “Calm the f-?-?-? down or you’re going to the bench” … it’s really fun to root against FSU for a variety of reasons … it’s hard to imagine two cooler QB names than “Marcus Mariota” and “Jameis Winston,” and their unique styles make it so you’d WANT them to succeed at the next level. One more disclaimer (something I’ve written about many times in this space): I wholeheartedly believe that NFL quarterbacks succeed for the following reasons: “talent” (25-30 percent) and “everything else,” which covers leadership, charisma, personality, work ethic, intelligence and not doing basically anything that Johnny Football does (70-75 percent). You’re not just the QB in pro football; you’re the CEO. You’re setting a week-to-week, day-to-day, hour-to-hour, minute-to-minute example. If your teammates don’t believe in you, if they don’t follow you, if they don’t totally care about protecting you or fighting for you, then you’re done. If you can’t crouch in a crunch-time huddle — down four, three minutes left, 80 yards to go — and look your 10 dudes in the eye and say with complete confidence, “WE ARE SCORING RIGHT NOW,” then you’re never making it in (Cris Carter voice) the National Football League. Now, you still need to make one specific throw in pro football: that 15-yard frozen rope to either sideline. If you can’t make that throw, you don’t have a chance. NFL defenses are just too good. And that’s what makes the Winston-Mariota debate so interesting: From what I saw (and what I’ve read, too), they both have plenty of athletic ability to make it in the NFL. Mariota fares much better with those leadership/charisma/personality pieces, but it’s impossible to know yet if he can make every NFL throw. And Winston drew raves for his leadership and charisma ON the field, but his myriad off-field issues (we don’t need to rehash them here) undeniably threaten that aforementioned 70-75 percent. So, who seemed more NFL-ish in the Rose Bowl, Winston or Mariota? Well, Mariota had a slight lead heading into New Year’s Day and certainly didn’t blow it. (That’s an understatement.) And even if Winston’s team fell apart in the second half, with his ghastly Sanchezesque fumble turned touchdown providing the death blow (although his clock management didn’t help), I’d rather build around Winston than Geno Smith, Josh McCown, Jake Locker, Blake Bortles or any of these other bottom-of-the-barrel NFL QBR disasters. Both of them just felt NFL-ish to me. At gunpoint, I’d take Mariota over Winston and build a fast-paced offense around him; I just think he’s a slightly safer bet. But for a league that’s starting Ryan Lindley in a Round 1 playoff game this weekend, the more the merrier. We need QBs. Last night’s Rose Bowl might have lost me money, but at least it made me feel like our collective situation under center is about to improve by 7 percent. Speaking of Lindley, it’s time to bang out some Round 1 picks. But first, as always, some actual emails from actual readers.

Q: What are the odds one of the Lions stomps on DeMarco Murray’s broken hand and incites an enormous brawl at midfield? 20 percent? If it happens, will they call it the “Malice at the Dallas?”
—Yonatan Z, San Jose BS: That too! We have a 1-in-5 chance of the Malice at the Dallas! Q: Matt Stafford has never won a road game against a team with a winning record.  Never ever ever.  Not even Jerry Jones’s stink can overcome that, right?
—Jason, Milwaukee BS: And I forgot that one, too. We get to see the “MATTHEW STAFFORD’S ROAD RECORD AGAINST WINNING TEAMS: 0-16” graphic a bunch of times. Can we take the car keys away from every Lions fan right now to be safe? I don’t want them driving after this game. Q: My girlfriend does an entire routine imagining how Belichick reacted on his wedding night with his (now ex-) wife. “Bill, it’s time for the rehearsal dinner.”
 “On to the ceremony!” “Bill, do you take this woman … ”
 “On to the reception!” “Bill, unzip my dress … ”
 “On to the honeymoon!” Do you think it’s possible for Belichick to ever exist in the here and now?
—Dave in Arlington BS: Your girlfriend sounds like a keeper! That’s a funny routine. Belichick as a dad would be just as funny … “Hey, Dad, I lost my tooth!”
“On to the Tooth Fairy … ” “Hey, Dad, I got into Harvard early admission!”
“On to the first semester … ” Couldn’t one of you Weirdos Who Knows How To Do Things On The Internet just create a Belichick soundboard in which he answers any conceivable life-related question with a Belichickian answer? And no, I don’t think it is possible for Belichick to live in the here and now. He has a future fetish. Q: Saw your “Best Ball” idea for the NBA. Did you know that Australian Rules Football uses that exact process to determine their MVP? After each game the referees vote for 1st, 2nd and 3rd most influential player in the game. The player with the most total points (3 for 1st, 2 for 2nd, 1 for 3rd) over the season wins the Brownlow Medal (the defacto MVP). Votes are sealed after every game, so the Brownlow is announced live at a postseason Red Carpet event with all the players there. This creates an ESPYs-esque unintentional comedy factor, in addition to a phenomenal gambling opportunity. Who wouldn’t want to get in on some amazing Robin Lopez +/- 1.5 NBA Best Balls action? Anyway, Aussie Rules Football is the best sport on earth, and I’m 100% all-in on the NBA Best Balls concept.
—David E., Chicago BS: Proving yet again that Australians are the coolest people on the planet. I’m still waiting for my first moment when I say to myself, “I wish Australia weren’t there.” Australia is like the Robert Horry or Philip Baker Hall of continents — it just makes everything it touches a little bit better. Well, except for tennis majors. I still think the Australian Open needs a gimmick that’s better than, “Our court is blue, we’re not on grass or clay, and we’re not in New York.” I vote for cheering/booing during play in all Australian Open matches. And the tennis community has to look the other way with PED use for those two weeks — as opposed to the other 50 weeks, when the tennis community still looks away. Don’t get me started. Q: Did you know Peyton Manning has to win the Super Bowl this year to push his career playoff record above .500?
—Augie, Irvine BS: Did you know Peyton Manning has lost more playoff games (12) than any quarterback ever? Did you know he’s 1-2 in the Super Bowl, and that he lost those two games by a combined 49 points? Did you know Manning’s regular-season passer rating (97.5) is 8.3 points higher than his playoff rating (89.2), even though he played 30 percent of those playoff games on the road? Did you know that Manning’s team was favored in 10 of his 12 playoff losses? Did you know he has more one-and-done postseasons (eight) than any other QB ever? Did you know he has only one game-winning drive in the playoffs? Did you know he’s lost playoff games to Jay Fiedler, Mark Sanchez and Chad Pennington? Did you know he threw three touchdowns and seven picks during his one Super Bowl–winning playoff run? Did you know that he’s 2-5 in outdoor playoff games on the road, with those two wins coming against Trent Green and a washed-up Steve McNair? Did you know that he destroyed the 2013 Pats to the tune of 400 yards, 2 TDs, 0 picks and a 118.4 passer rating and I should immediately shut up? Q: Dear Grantland Layout Editor/Unpaid Intern, Please start putting all of Bill’s picks in one convenient box in addition to randomly sprayed over 6,900 words. It shouldn’t be this hard to confirm he went 7-9 against the spread yet again, right? Thanks for doing the Lord’s work.
 –Kelly, Newport, KY BS: Come on! I finished 101-93-4 against the spread during the 13 weeks when we posted this column, and an astonishing 58-0 during the four weeks when we didn’t. And I’m 11-3-2 against the spread in Round 1 games since 2011. GIVE ME THE PROPER AMOUNT OF RESPECT, RANDOM PERSON FROM KENTUCKY! Q: Merry Christmas! For all of your Panthers bashing this year, I’m going to send you a fruit cake in the mail, except that instead of fruit and nuts, there will be little pieces of chopped up donkey dick in it. I’m usually a big fan, but your blithe and snide dismissal of the Panthers has shaken my faith in you.  They will win in Atlanta and win their 1st playoff game at home and then you will be eating humble pie…and donkey dick cake.
—Jon, New York BS: I didn’t get the donkey dick cake yet — did you at least make it gluten-free for me? Q: Is Carolina-Arizona the least enjoyable playoff match-up ever? It feels like this game should be on NBA TV.
—Dan, Appleton, WI BS: I thought that was hilarious even before I read that someone tweeted that joke to Barnwell. Is there any way they could fly in 11,000 depressed Atlanta Hawks fans just to complete the NBA TV effect? Q: I just spent the past 4 years playing defense for a college team that couldn’t score. It’s a demoralizing experience. You know you are probably only getting 3 plays off. Maybe 6 if you’re lucky. You’re constantly paranoid about having to defend a short field because of an erroneous turnover. You feel that if you can’t protect a 7-0 lead you’re going to lose. So I can understand the psychological toll that playing defense for Ryan freakin Lindley against the Seahawks has on a person. At least when Stanton plays, Arizona believes they can win. With Lindley or Logan Thomas at quarterback, there’s no hope. I don’t want to diminish Seattle’s accomplishment in Week 16, but they did not destroy a great defense; they beat up a progressively mentally defeated defense.
—Jake, Boston BS: And that’s the real reason why Arizona’s defense “slipped” these past few weeks. You can’t thrive on defense knowing that the game is over if you fall behind 10-0. And by the way, when your fans are glumly saying, “If we only had Drew Stanton for this one,” there’s a 97.8 percent chance that you’re absolutely screwed. Q: The NFL: where you get suspended two games for punching your girlfriend in the face or one playoff game for stepping on Aaron Rodgers.
—Matt H., Detroit BS: Come on, that’s not fair! The NFL’s Ted Cottrell overturned the league’s original suspension in what ended up being Team Goodell’s last flip-flop of the 2014 season. After it happened, I tweeted that “Roger Goodell is like the Elf on the Shelf — he’s an imaginary disciplinary figure who has to be moved around manually from room to room.” I’m calling Goodell that from now on. He’s the NF-Elf on the Shelf. To believe in the competence of his disciplinary acumen at this point, you have to take such a big leap of faith that it’s really no different from your kids believing that a Christmas elf doll is judging them for bad behavior, reporting back to Santa and switching rooms every night as soon as everyone falls asleep. But don’t worry, Roger — you won. You kept your obscenely overpaid job, you made it to the playoffs, and nobody cares that you just submitted the worst one-year performance in the history of the commissioner position. Not just the NFL, but any sport. Gary Bettman could have climbed on a Zamboni during Thursday’s Winter Classic and started running over Blackhawks and Capitals and his 2015 still wouldn’t have been worse than Goodell’s 2014. It’s amazing that Ray Rice, Adrian Peterson and Donald Sterling froze Goodell out of the top three for 2014’s Anti-Sportsman of the Year. My pick remains Sterling for the same reason that Marty Scorsese won the 2006 Oscar for The Departed — it’s a career achievement award, basically. Q: Listened to the pod with Sal this week. As a Ravens fan, you are correct. This is not a great football team. But haven’t we seen not-so-great teams win in the playoffs? This team has some pieces: Jacoby Jones & Special Teams (ranked #1 according to Football Outsiders), the Pass Rush (the front-7 will hit Ben and hit him often – could win turnover battle), Flacco’s Deep Ball (you say it all the time, the biggest threat is a QB with a deep ball), and Justin Tucker (nice weapon especially in the 4th quarter). I know our secondary is a dumpster fire and our offensive line is banged up, but the Ravens have certain intangibles that playoff teams have when they go on unexpected runs. (Whew…got through all of this without bringing up Ray Rice.)
—AJ, Charlotte BS: Sorry, I’m not buying the Ravens. Sing it one last time, Radiohead!  Q: Pats fan here.  Just want to ask you…What the hell are you doing?  You say in your podcast that you would “welcome” the Ravens to play the Patriots in round two and you are not scared at all?  You wrote about the playoff powers of the Wonk Team.1 Don’t you know that the Ravens are the Wonk Team!!! You called it before the season!!! And you are disrespecting them on the air!!! Dammit Simmons.  Ever since your podcast I haven’t been sleeping. I cant eat.  I cant concentrate.  Please give some sort of double reverse jinx against the Ravens in your article tomorrow.  PLEASE!!!
—Jacob, Glendale AZ BS: First of all, settle down. The Ravens aren’t the 2014 Wonk Team — it’s almost definitely the 7-8-1 Panthers, a deeply flawed team from a comically incompetent division that went 64 days between victories, then turned things around by beating four straight lousy teams and drawing the Arizona Lindleys at home in Round 1. They’re one win away from securing “ABSOLUTELY NOBODY BELIEVES IN US!!!!!” status heading into Round 2’s game in Seattle.2 Oh, and if Arizona somehow beats Carolina, then THEY become the Wonk Team. Either way, it’s not the Ravens. So rest easy, Jacob from Glendale. A quick reminder since we’re here: The Wonk Team has won four Super Bowls and a bewildering 22 of 25 playoff games since 2007. The complete list: 2013 Chargers (1-1); 2012 Ravens (4-0), 2011 Giants (4-0), 2010 Packers (4-0), 2009 Jets (2-1), 2008 Cards (3-1), 2007 Giants (4-0). Again … 22 of 25!!!!! Including some of the biggest underdog playoff upsets this century. Beware of the Wonk Team. Repeat: Beware of the Wonk Team. Q: LONG LIVE JOHNNY CURFEW!
—Alexander, New York, NY BS: “What if I told you that Johnny Football would become Johnny TMZ, Johnny Clipboard, Johnny Curfew and Johnny Waiver Wire in the span of nine months? From ESPN Films, it’s a new 30 for 30 documentary, Johnny Be Bad, directed by Skip Bayless.” Q: Has there ever been a better Least Valuable Player candidate than Johnny Douchebag?  Not just for everything he’s done through week 16, but being able to play a large part in your team not only losing to, but handing your biggest rivals a playoff spot WHILE YOU ARE INJURED?  By throwing a party and costing your team two of their best players?  Just days after giving interviews about being more mature?
—Mike, St. Louis via Cleveland BS: You totally insulted our 2014 co-LVPs, Ray Rice and Adrian Peterson. Come on. Q: Who is your “This QB is hot going into the playoffs and could rattle off 4 straight wins” team and why isn’t it Tony Romo’s Cowboys? Have you seen this stat? Romo has the 5th highest passer rating since 1970. The four ahead of him: Rodgers in 2011 (Won the super bowl), Peyton in 2004 (lost second round), Brady in 2007 (lost Super Bowl), and Peyton in 2013 (lost Super Bowl). The two after him: Steve Young in 1994 (won Super Bowl) and Joe Montana in 1989 (won Super Bowl). 
—Augie, Irvine BS: Allow me to counter those numbers with Mike Sando’s sobering 90s/20s revelation, covered on ESPN.com and this week’s B.S. Report. Basically, Dallas’s recent doppelgängers as a great offense/lousy defense team were the 2010 Saints (lost Round 1 to Seattle), the 2011 Packers (lost Round 2 to the Giants) and 2008 Saints (missed playoffs). So I think that’s a dead heat. Q: In last week’s article you pondered “a potential Ryan Lindley vs. Derek Anderson outdoors playoff matchup in Round 1.” So what’s the worst QB matchup in playoff history?  My vote? Quincy Carter vs. Jake Delhomme in 2003.
—Michael, Saint John, New Brunswick, Canada BS: That’s the winner on paper, but Jake was GOOD that postseason: Three straight wins (two on the road), six TDs, one pick and a QB rating in triple figures. You can’t judge 2003 Delhomme by the Delhommes that came later. Anyway, I didn’t have time to peruse decades and decades of playoff football, but I did pore over the 21st century and found these honorable-mention worst matchups: T.J. Yates vs. Andy Dalton (January 2012), Chris Simms vs. Washed-up Mark Brunell (January 2006), Elvis Grbac vs. Jay Fiedler (January 2002), and Trent Dilfer vs. Gus Frerotte/Jarious Jackson (December 31, 2000). Your winner? Chris Simms vs. Washed-Up Mark Brunell! That Bizarro Shootout yielded 27 combined points (seven from a fumble TD return), 239 total passing yards and just 363 total yards of offense as Washington (2.5-point favs) covered in Tampa Bay. Brunell and Simms started only three more NFL games combined. And yes, I will always have a fond memory of this game because I picked it correctly and even wagered on the Deadskins. Don’t bring atrocious QB matchups into my house! Q: Did you know RYAN TANNEHILL threw for over 4,000 yards this season? I miss football without rules.
—Ted, Reading, PA BS: I actually didn’t believe this and looked it up. It’s true. You know what else is true? Ryan Tannehill now has as many 4,000-yard seasons as John Elway and Joe Montana combined. Let’s just move on before I start sobbing. Q: You know who effects every offensive play? Every QB on every team in the NFL. Well how many player effect every defensive play? Just JJ Watt. Try this, who’s the second best player on the Texans defense? I’m waiting… The corpse of Brian Cushing? The #1 overall pick who played less than one healthy game this year? There is no answer. There’s not one other player on the Texans defense who’s inarguably above average. Rodgers is great, yadda yadda, QBs are more valuable in general (duh) but it’s not the “Best QB On a Playoff Team” award. JJ has dragged a team that went 2-14 last year, went through 4 QBs and got zero help from a draft pick in the first 5 rounds almost to the playoffs. He’s the MVP.
—JD, Houston BS: As for the other side … Q: JJ Watt should not win the MVP for the simple reason that he did not add “value” to his team. How “valuable” can you be if your team still misses the playoffs that season? If he doesn’t play this year they win 4 or so less games, still missing the playoffs but getting a much better draft pick. In a perverse way he’s one of the 2014 LVPs. 
—Taylor, Tallahassee BS: All good points. Then again, the chasm between Watt and Every Other Good Defensive Lineman was significantly larger than the chasm between Rodgers and Every Other Good QB. And Watt owned the 2014 season more than anyone else. But I thought Rodgers needed a signature game to swing the race … and that’s exactly what happened. He swung the race just enough by coming back from injury to beat the Lions. Packers fans believe it’s their version of the Willis Reed game; non-cynical NFL fans believe it was one of the most dramatic moments of the season; and cynical NFL fans have Rodgers’s “miraculous” return ranked somewhere between Paul Pierce’s Wheelchair Game in the 2008 Finals and Keyser Söze’s final scene in The Usual Suspects. But Rodgers needed SOMETHING like that to pass Watt. And it happened. Q: Here’s why Steelers-Ravens owns the Best Rivalry title. Both teams have been successful for the last decade just like Brady-Manning, but true hatred sets them apart. The refs aren’t stopping play for 10 minutes during Brady-Manning games to warn the sidelines and pull those two apart (like Steelers-Ravens in week 9). I hate the Ravens. Each game is a slugfest that toes the line between tough football and a straight out street fight. Search Steelers-Ravens on YouTube and pretty much the only thing that comes up are “Jacked Up” style highlights of Willis McGahee getting destroyed by Ryan Clark or Le’Veon Bell getting knocked into next week. And the best part is we WANT that. We want to play under the rules from 10-20 years ago where everyone is free game and don’t you dare go over the middle. THAT’S why this is the best rivalry in sports.
—Rob, Pittsburgh BS: An undeniably compelling case. It forced me to subtly revamp my Top Six Rivalries list: 1. Ravens-Steelers
2. Brady-Manning
3. Goodell-Truth
4. Cowboys-Eagles
5. Andy Reid–The Clock
6. Aaron Rodgers–Daniel Day-Lewis

181,The Tale of Two Flaccos,"Hey Simmons, I got you a belated Christmas/Happy 2015 gift: it’s the winningest road playoff team in NFL history and Foxboro’s arch nemesis, the Baltimore Ravens! I know you said you weren’t worried but after hammering our most bitter rival, in their stadium, I — OH MY GOD, THAT’S PLAYOFF JOE FLACCO’S MUSIC!!!!!!!!!
—Jared Lee, Phoenix Anytime you type “Flacco” into your iPhone, it autocorrects to “Flaccid.” Does it happen courtesy of a ball-busting Apple programmer from Pittsburgh or Cleveland? Maybe. Or maybe it’s just the perfect way to describe Baltimore’s quarterback. Maybe he’s really two people — Joe Flaccid is Regular-Season Clark Kent, Joe Flacco is Playoff Superman. You barely notice Joe Flaccid during the regular season … unless he’s starting for your fantasy team, in which case something clearly went wrong. That version of Flacco averages 21.1 touchdown passes per season. He has never thrown for 400 yards (in a game) or 4,000 (in a season). He started 112 games and topped 300 yards in only 21 of them. He’s never run for 200 yards in a season. He has one career four-TD game and one career five-TD game. He spent most of 2013 looking like this generation’s Vince Ferragamo: 19 touchdowns and 22 picks (and just a 73.1 passer rating). Until 2014, he never cracked the top 10 for QBR.1 He cracked the top 10 for passer rating only once: in 2010, when he finished seventh. His career passing rating (84.8) trails generational rivals like Jay Cutler (85.2), Andy Dalton (85.2) and Cam Newton (85.4). More on the Super Bowl Barnwell’s Super Bowl Breakdown Belichick: The Great Defender Giving Vince Wilfork His Due Marshawn Lynch and the Media Cousin Sal’s SB Prop Bets Beware the Visor: Kam Chancellor Among the Lurchers at Media Day Pats and Seahawks Weaknesses NFL Defense Championship Belt Matthew Slater: Mr. Special Teams Story of the First Tackle How Belichick Rules the Draft ‘You Mad, Bro?’ Revisited Pierce on the Deflatriots Farce The Pats’ Homegrown Linebackers More on the Super Bowl His best quality? Hold on, you might want to take a seat because it’s so exciting: that’s right, durability. In his first seven regular seasons, Joe Flaccid won 72 of his 112 starts without missing a game. He also throws a splendid deep ball that yields big plays and valuable pass-interference penalties. In fact, Flacco led the NFL in a goofy-but-valuable statistic called “clutch-weighted expected points based on penalties” in five of the last six seasons. It’s a fancy way of saying, “He excels at throwing deep and making SOMETHING happen.” Over everything else, it’s the scariest thing about wagering against Joe Flaccid — an experience that isn’t really that scary. To recap: durability, pretty deep balls AND timely pass-interference penalties! You wouldn’t call it the sexiest quarterback package, and you certainly wouldn’t feel great about paying one of the league’s most lucrative ransoms for it. Did Joe Flaccid’s mega-contract make Bill Barnwell’s list of worst NFL contracts just five months ago?2 Yes. Yes it did. Then again, the Ravens weren’t paying for Joe Flaccid. They were paying for Joe Flacco. You know, the calm dude from the playoffs. The towering, smiling, handsome, lanky, confident, gunslinging, teaser-killing, flag-generating, deep-ball-flinging machine. This version of Flacco suffered growing pains: seven straight road playoff battles; in the first five, he had no 200-yard games, one touchdown and six picks, three wins and two losses, and two season-ending stink bombs against the 2008-09 Steelers (three picks) and 2009-10 Colts (two picks, three points total). He looked better in his third postseason appearance (two more road games, including a blowout win in K.C.), then blossomed the following winter when deep threat Torrey Smith showed up. Flacco’s seven-game playoff stretch from January 2012 through last weekend kinda sorta maybe backs up John Harbaugh’s claim that Flacco is “the best quarterback in football.” What did those five words REALLY mean? I judge quarterbacks by how they play when it matters. My guy wins on the road. My guy has a three-years-and-counting track record of coming up big in January and February. Nobody else can say this. Hence, my guy is the best quarterback in football. I trust my guy more than any other guy. I mean … you definitely can’t call Harbaugh a liar.3 Check out these highlights: • Baltimore won six of seven playoff games. The loss? 2012’s AFC title game … when Lee Evans briefly caught a game-winning touchdown that New England’s Sterling Moore heroically stripped away, then Billy Cundiff missed the game-tying 32-yarder.4 • 2013’s four-victory hot streak that yielded a Super Bowl MVP trophy, road wins over two legends (Brady and Manning), one of the greatest throws in football history (the pseudo–Hail Mary to Jacoby Jones), a game-winning drive IN THE SUPER BOWL, and a ridiculous 11-0 TD/INT ratio. • The following 13 words will almost certainly go on his NFL tombstone: “Either ’89 Montana or ’13 Flacco had the greatest single NFL postseason ever.” • His stealth legacy as the guy who unleashed the best contract run in NFL history (and maybe even sports history). In the winter of 2013, Flacco doubled his value on the open market. It was like Ronnie and Sammi during the final Jersey Shore season, only the exact opposite. (More on this in a second.) • With the possible exception of Montana, has any quarterback ever slapped together a better seven-game playoff stretch? Flacco’s numbers: 1,881 passing yards, 17 TDs, one turnover, a 110.7 passing rating (including five straight 105-plus games), 74.3 QBR, and 28 times when my wife walked into the TV room and asked, “Who’s that? He’s really handsome.” • You want to wager against Joe Flacco? He has covered the last six Baltimore playoff spreads. Not since Eddie DeBartolo’s heyday have Vegas casinos feared the powers of an NFL Italian this much.5 He also became our second-most important/influential/beloved Delaware-related celebrity, narrowly edging juggernauts like Joe Biden, Elisabeth Shue, Ryan Phillippe, Paul Goldschmidt, Aubrey Plaza and the great Valerie Bertinelli. With a second Super Bowl ring, he might even pass Elena Della Donne and become Delaware’s most beloved celebrity, period.6 • In Peter King’s last MMQB column, Flacco submitted a Hall of Fame quote about playing quarterback in pressure games. He was remembering how Elvis Dumervil tried to chat with him during the Steelers game, but Flacco blew him off because he was, as Dumervil put it, “in the zone.” Here’s how Flacco described the zone. “I gotta be able to react to things and think, and not let my emotions get the best of me. My personality fits that. I get the most comfort before a game just sitting in here and saying to myself, ‘Go out there and just play the game. Take what they give you. Keep doing it, keep doing it, keep doing it.’ If you do it well enough, you’re going to win a football game. Having that peace definitely helps. You have to be in the moment and stay in the moment.” He could have been describing Aaron Rodgers (read the Joe Cool section in Chris B. Brown’s recent Grantland story), Phil Mickelson, Madison Bumgarner, Tim Duncan … I mean, pick a name. The Tao of Joe Flacco makes sense. Don’t get high, don’t get low. Stay cool. Stay in the moment. Find that peace. For whatever reason, he can’t remain in that zone from September through December — that’s why Joe Flaccid made Barnwell’s Worst Contracts list as the NFL’s version of Deron Williams. But in the playoffs? Joe Flacco finds that zone. He finds that peace. ??? For most of the history of modern sports — say, 1950 through 2005 — we would have raved that Joe Flacco was “clutch” and left it at that. Ten years later, it’s much riskier to spit out a blanket statement without offering additional evidence … unless you want to be branded with a “HOT TAKE ALERT!” tattoo and get skewered across the Internet. You can’t cut corners in 2015. We’re too sophisticated about sports, mainly because of a relatively recent infatuation with advanced numbers and unconventional metrics. For instance, Kirk Goldsberry’s recent story about James Harden’s futuristic offensive impact was one of Grantland’s smartest pieces ever; Goldsberry’s angle would have been inconceivable in 2005 (both visually and intellectually), back when we would have collectively decided, “James Harden is an MVP candidate, he’s playing great!” without peeling off more layers of the Harden onion. I love numbers. They make me understand what I am watching, day after day, more deeply than ever before. At the same time … We’re stuck in something of a gray area now. It’s wonderful for accuracy, but it’s terrible for entertaining debate. There’s always a “Yeah, but” now. Everything hinges on degrees. You can’t just say, “Joe Flacco is clutch” without including a disclaimer like, “Yeah, but if Rahim Moore plays that one deep ball correctly, suddenly Flacco is 4-4 in the previous four postseasons, doesn’t have a giant contract, doesn’t have a Super Bowl MVP, and isn’t leading your Round 2 column right now.” Yeah, but. Joe Flacco has played a series of games that have made it seem like he’s clutch, but that doesn’t mean he’s clutch. Or something.
B.S. Report: Bill Barnwell and J-Bug Bill Barnwell and J-Bug on the NFL playoffs and Boston's Olympic bid 
And again, I appreciate 99 percent of the New Era of Sports Thinking. We’re unquestionably and undeniably smarter now. But you also read and hear so much more hedging, so much more stammering, so much presenting-both-sides-of-the-picture, so many timid arguments because writers don’t want their opinions thrown back in their face later. It also enables certain radio hosts and television hosts to take comically strong stands, one way or the other, simply because everyone else is setting up shop somewhere in the rational middle. They don’t have to be right; they just have to stand out. It’s much easier to stand out in 2015, that’s for sure. It’s just a weird time. Like so many others with a forum, I find myself calibrating the difference between “Here’s what I actually think” and “Here’s an educated opinion that’s being presented as safely as possible” pretty much all the time. You want to remain as candid as you can, but you don’t want to leave the impression that you were only trying to provoke a reaction, either. A good example: When the recent NBA season started, I didn’t think LeBron looked right. He just didn’t look like LEBRON. Something was different. And it wasn’t just his curious weight loss. He didn’t have the same energy. He wasn’t trying nearly as hard on defense (something that started last season, actually). He played mostly below the rim, not above and through people. So I went on Colin Cowherd’s show and mentioned these points, even wondering aloud if there was a chance — repeat: a chance — that LeBron’s second Cleveland stint could unfold like Albert Pujols’s move to Anaheim did. In other words, was it possible that Cleveland acquired the best player of his generation right as he was about to cease being the best player of his generation? Was he injured and not telling us? Was he overwhelmed by all the off-the-court stuff that accompanies coming back home? I didn’t know WHAT was happening, just that something was happening. I trusted my own eyes. And so I took a few seconds setting up my point (with too many disclaimers), and by the time I blurted out the actual take, it sounded like I was cautiously throwing out a theory over pushing something that I actually believed. Why play it that way? Because I didn’t want anyone to blow whatever I said out of proportion, which is (ironically) what happened, anyway. Looking back, I should have been more blunt and just owned it. Every instinct I had — confirmed from 40-plus years of watching basketball and attending games — told me that something looked unequivocally different about LeBron James. Common sense told me that Apex LeBron had gone to Apex Sports Heaven — not just because of LeBron’s insane amount of minutes/mileage/wear and tear from his first 11 seasons (especially these last four), but because it’s impossible to be ALL CAPS GREAT indefinitely. Nobody has pulled it off for more than a few years. Nobody. You can’t be the league’s best offensive player AND defensive player for eight months a year, every year, for a solid decade. Even the NBA’s G.O.A.T. walked away from professional basketball for 20 months, in his prime, because he was mentally and physically worn down.7 Real greatness has a shelf life. And LeBron was really great for six seasons: the last two in Cleveland, then all four in Miami. He played 451 regular-season games, 112 playoff games and nearly 22,000 grueling minutes. He carried teams offensively, absorbed a ludicrous amount of punishment, then logged a superhuman two-way burden in every postseason. He averaged nearly 43 minutes per game in Miami’s 67 playoff games from 2011 through 2013. During the lockout season, he played 85 games and more than 3,300 minutes in less than six months. Those are miles. Lots of them. And I don’t care who you are … that shit is gonna add up. Apex LeBron’s shelf life ended last summer and that was that. LeBron James will never be quite the same. I watched it happen with Jordan, Bird, Magic, Duncan, Kobe, Julius, Malone, Barkley, Hakeem … you name it, they hit the exact same invisible tipping point that LeBron hit last June. It happens. It’s sports. It’s life. And you know what? Here’s a case where I didn’t even need to research the numbers, even if nearly all of LeBron’s 2014-15 numbers back me up. For six solid years, you could have taken any non-NBA fan to any LeBron game — your mom, your 7-year-old son, a foreigner, an alien, whomever (as long as they were a blank slate with basketball) — watched 15 minutes and asked that person to pick out the best player. And I don’t care who else was out there. Every time, they would have pointed to LeBron. In 2015, that’s not a sure thing anymore. Depending on the night, they might point to Harden, Westbrook, Durant, Davis, Curry … I don’t know. That’s one of the best things about this season. It’s an Alpha Dog In Flux season. Anyway, it makes me happy that the Eye Test still matters, even if it has become an increasingly undervalued way to discuss sports. When the right numbers back up what you’re seeing, even better. That’s the sweet spot. Intuition plus actual evidence. And in Joe Flacco’s case, that admittedly small seven-game sample size backs up everything I actually watched. For whatever reason, the NFL playoffs roll around and Joe Flacco just LOOKS different. Maybe it’s an optical illusion. Maybe. ??? So yeah, I wish Joe Flaccid were showing up in New England on Saturday night, but I am absolutely expecting Joe Flacco. People keep blowing out the whole Ravens/Patriots/nemesis angle, even though the 2009 Pats were the worst Belichick team of the past 12 years (and lost Wes Welker the week before); the 2012 Pats featured a makeshift secondary and a one-armed Gronk (and won anyway); and the 2013 Pats were missing Gronk altogether. This particular Patriots team is really good and features the best Patriots defense in 10 years, fueled by a suddenly reliable secondary and the one and only Darrelle Revis (Belichick’s best free-agent signing ever). You know the recipe for beating the Belichick-Brady Patriots by now. Run the ball, chew up clock and limit possessions. Connect on a couple of deep throws. Pressure Brady up the middle with four guys, make him move from side to side, knock him around, make him uncomfortable. Force a turnover or two. Get a special teams play. Allow the short stuff to the slot guys and tight ends, then pancake them after the catch. And if you end up with a couple extra flags for being too rough, so be it. In other words … Ravens Football. I never thought the 2014-15 Ravens could brew that Patriots/Kryptonite recipe until last weekend in Pittsburgh. Their offensive line was more banged up than Charlie Sheen. Their secondary had more holes than the Mueller report. They looked like a deeply flawed pseudo-contender that hadn’t played a great game for four solid months … until they did. Over everything else, you notice Baltimore’s big-game players in truly big games. You know Ngata, Suggs and Dumervil are showing up. So are the Smiths (Torrey and Steve). So is Justin Tucker. So is Jacoby Jones. So is John Harbaugh. And so is Joe Flacco. That’s enough for four quarters — control the lines, avoid turnovers, make two big plays, make your kicks, shift field position with a big return, and suddenly you’re winning in the fourth quarter as opposing fans flood each other with “WTF???” texts. That’s what the Ravens have been able to do, over and over again, since Harbaugh and Flacco arrived. Of course, the Ravens have one other (frightening) variable going for them. Allow two readers to explain … Cal in Los Angeles: “It is impossible to predict the Wonk Team before the playoffs. But the moment you picked Carolina to be the 2014 Wonk Team and dismissed the Ravens, you (by definition) turned the Ravens into the Wonk Team. And now, the Wonk Team heads to New England. You had ONE JOB, Simmons, and that was to NOT JINX THE PATS. You blew it, and we’re f–ked.” Sampo in Palo Alto: “I’m in pre-emptive mourning for the Pats already, and I blame you. The whole season, I’ve been terrified of the Ravens — the classic team that sweats out making the playoffs, then turns on the jets. I crossed my fingers time and again that they would miss the playoffs, purely so the Pats wouldn’t have to face them in Round 2, but now it’s going to happen. You know why it happened? BECAUSE YOU KEPT REFUSING TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THEY’RE THE WONK TEAM. YOU KEPT TALKING ABOUT HOW YOU WEREN’T SCARED OF THEM … BUT NOW THAT WE’VE SEEN ROUND 1, EVERYONE KNOWS THAT THE RAVENS ARE F***ING TERRIFYING. That defense is going to give the Pats fits, the pass rush is going to get to Brady, and Flacco will deliver at least 2 50-yard bombs. All you had to do was pretend you were scared of the Ravens and then none of this would have happened. Instead, you jinxed it, and wasted another year of Brady’s career. I hate you. I hate you so much.” My defense: You can’t figure out the Wonk Team until after Round 1 or Round 2. For all we know, it still might be Carolina, right? Our recent history of Wonkocity reveals that we never knew until Round 2 with the exception of last year (8-8 San Diego winning in Cincy). 2007-08 Giants (4-0): Round 2, upset 2-seed Dallas as 7-point dogs 2008-09 Cardinals (3-1): Round 2, upset 1-seed Carolina as 10-point dogs 2009-10 Jets (2-1): Round 2, upset 2-seed San Diego as 9-point dogs 2010-11 Jets (2-1): Round 2, upset 1-seed New England as 9.5-point dogs 2011-12 Giants (4-0): Round 2, upset 1-seed Green Bay as 8-point dogs 2012-13 Ravens (4-0): Round 2, upset 1-seed Denver as 9-point dogs 2013-14 Chargers (1-1): Round 2, lost in Denver as 7.5-point dogs (but covered) Heading into this year’s postseason, the Wonk Team was 20-4 since 2007 — a stretch that included FOUR Super Bowl wins, one Super Bowl loss (barely), 13 road victories and a stupefying 22-2 record against the spread.8 That’s a great sign for either Baltimore (7-point dogs) or Carolina (11-point dogs), but after watching a banged-up Cam Newton sailing footballs like a hungover intramural QB last weekend, do you really expect Carolina to waltz into Seattle and move the football against the league’s hairiest defense? Me neither. That leaves Baltimore as this month’s Wonk Team. Yikes. You know what else that means? Recent Wonk Team history gives Baltimore a legitimate chance to complete the Roethlisberger/Brady/Manning road-beating trifecta, then topple Rodgers, Romo or Seattle in the Super Bowl. And if Joe Flacco plays as well in those three games as he played in the last seven? Welcome to the greatest 10-game postseason stretch we’ve ever seen. It’s in play. Here’s the only thing I know for sure: On Saturday night, at some point, Patriots fans all around the country will text a friend just to say, “Flacco scares me.” Their iPhones will change it to “Flaccid,” like always. It will be a mistake. (And yes, I am belatedly worried.)",2015-01-09T09:34:58+00:00,2015 NFL Playoffs,Simmons
182,The Divisional Mailbag,"If you missed my Friday-morning piece about Joe Flacco and the wonky Ravens, CLICK HERE. Let’s rip through some reader emails before we tackle Round 2 picks. As always, these are actual emails from actual readers. Q: Who makes the Ravens by far the most dangerous team to the Patriots and anyone else in their path?  A 5’9?  amalgam of karma, vengance, and  the”nobody believes in us” sentiment personified. I speak of course of Steve Smith. [EDITOR’S NOTE: We cut the next 400 words explaining Smith’s history of taking everything personally, as well as the fact that the 2003-04 Pats stole his Super Bowl ring.] Sleep well Simmons. Steve Smith is waiting.
—John T, Winston-Salem More on the Super Bowl Barnwell’s Super Bowl Breakdown Belichick: The Great Defender Giving Vince Wilfork His Due Marshawn Lynch and the Media Cousin Sal’s SB Prop Bets Beware the Visor: Kam Chancellor Among the Lurchers at Media Day Pats and Seahawks Weaknesses NFL Defense Championship Belt Matthew Slater: Mr. Special Teams Story of the First Tackle How Belichick Rules the Draft ‘You Mad, Bro?’ Revisited Pierce on the Deflatriots Farce The Pats’ Homegrown Linebackers More on the Super Bowl BS: Just when I didn’t think I could be more nervous for Saturday’s game. By the way, it’s really, really, really hard for me to root against Steve Smith. He brought me so much joy over the years as the NFL’s answer to Allen Iverson — a diminutive, overcompetitive ball of energy who punched out multiple teammates, carried himself like a warrior, made us laugh and provided a score of thoughtful sound bites. I love “villains” who would immediately become your favorite player the moment they switched to your team. That’s Steve Smith. He would have made a great Patriot. Years from now, whenever I want to remember Steve Smith, I’ll call up his unbelievable “Mic’d Up” segment for the same Week 1 game in which Jake Delhomme threw four ghastly picks and commenced The Great Jake Delhomme Meltdown of 2009. You can actually see Smith passing through the Seven Stages of Grief as the clip rolls on. It ends with them sitting sadly on the bench, Smith forcing himself to console a shell-shocked Delhomme (but not totally meaning it). If they ever held the Greatest “Mic’d Up” Players Ever tournament, Steve Smith and J.J. Watt would be the no. 1 seeds. Q: After beating Arizona and releasing Jake Delhomme’s spirit from limbo, do you realize that the Panthers are now 1 of 4 games through their 20th anniversary revenge tour? Their first four playoff appearances: 1996, 2003, 2005, 2008. Who beat them?  Arizona, Seattle, New England, Green Bay. The Panthers could exact revenge one game at a time, ending in none other than a Patriots-Panthers Super Bowl rematch from ’03. You taste that? That’s the delusional fantasies of an 8-8-1 divisional playoff team.
—Mike A., Shanghai BS: Is it OK if I don’t add “Beware of Carolina’s 20th-Anniversary Tour” to the Playoff Gambling Manifesto? Q: Who hands Steve Bisciotti the Lombardi trophy when the Ravens inevitably win the Super Bowl in a few weeks? Does Goodell no-show, later claiming he never saw the game?
—Chris, Baltimore BS: Nope — Goodell hands it to Bisciotti. Here’s an advance clip:  Q: Don’t know if you’ve seen this story about J.J. Watt’s poster surviving a house fire, but isn’t it the best closing scene for the MegaWatt movie? End credits roll, the fire, the poster standing unscathed by the flames, everything around it blackened and burning. Damn, makes for great cinema! Pitch it already to any studio!
—Alberto, Houston, TX BS: You forgot about Blake Shelton’s MegaWatt theme song playing as the camera homes in on the unburned poster. Is it weird that the Watt poster/house fire news story single-handedly swung the MVP vote that I don’t have? I’m that easy. Q: Last year I wrote you that Tony Romo is the NFL’s version of Dirk Nowitzki (great stats, underachieving teams, somewhat unfair “choker” status) and that all that was missing was a satisfying postseason run to a championship. The 2011 Mavs and 2014 Cowboys are very similar; everyone dismissed them as legit contenders. A championship turns Romo’s narrative on its ear, just like it did for Dirk. Like a true Cowboys fan (who survived the flotsam at QB forever between Aikman and Romo) I am constantly waiting for the other shoe to drop, but I feel hopeful Simmons. I really do. And we all know that “hope is a good thing, maybe the best thing.”
—Jon G., Lincoln BS: And you left out the piece about how both guys starred for Dallas. Anyway, I hate to be a party pooper … but Dirk was a much better player than Romo. When I published my NBA book in November 2009, Dirk had already carried the Mavs to the Finals, won an MVP and earned a 39th ranking in my Hall of Fame Pyramid. Nineteen months later, he won the Finals MVP and reinvented his legacy. In 2015, you can still find Dirk chugging along as a borderline 50-40-90 guy on a playoff contender. He’s a top-20 Pyramid guy; you can make an excellent case that he’s the fourth-best forward ever (trailing only Bird, Duncan and LeBron in some order). Meanwhile, Romo has never played in a conference title game, he’s never won an MVP, he hasn’t even won 80 games yet (including the playoffs), and he couldn’t match Nowitzki’s longevity or uniqueness (much less his offensive ceiling). You’d never include Romo in any “greatest” conversation, but you’d include Dirk in a variety of them — “greatest shooter,” “greatest offensive 7-footer,” “greatest foreign player,” “greatest signature scoring move” and even “greatest accent that sounds like the perfect cross between urban and German.” Q: Is Cousin Sal now the Peyton Manning of NFL picks? Record-setting regular season, followed by abrupt, unexpected failure in the playoffs? Or is he Andy Dalton?  Success in regular season was smoke and mirrors, but we all knew he was gonna fail in playoffs (once we heard he was backing Lindley)?
—Pete, Atlanta BS: Cousin Sal’s response: “I like to think of myself not as Manning or Dalton — but rather a young Daniel LaRusso. I took Reseda by storm. Fought my way through the All-Valley Tournament only to suffer a fluke, debilitating injury when Ryan Lindley pelted my leg with a bevy of pathetically disgraceful interceptions. But rather than skip the finals, I asked Stan Verrett to use his mystical powers to fix my injured wheel. The ship is righted. Jump onboard as I crane kick the crap out of your bookie this weekend. Banzai!!!” (PS: The Cuz picked Dallas and a Seattle/Denver tease this weekend. Let’s hope we don’t have to get him a body bag.) Q: I don’t know what’s worse. The fact that Indianapolis traded a first round pick for Trent Richardson or that Cleveland parlayed that pick into Johnny Manziel?
—Aaron, Tampa BS: I wanted to make sure that this was a historically awful trade, so here’s how it lays out. Richardson bombed in Indy, played one snap in last weekend’s Round 1 game and recently earned the headline “Trent Richardson Practices on Colts’ Punt Coverage.” The Colts would have been better keeping that first-rounder and drafting a chauffeur for Jim Irsay. As for the Browns, they landed the no. 26 overall pick via Indy, then dealt it along with no. 83 to Philly for no. 22 … and took Manziel, who turned out to be A LIAR AND AN ALCOHOLIC!!!!! (Sorry, I was auditioning for First Take again.) Philly flipped no. 83 to Houston for no. 101 and no. 141. Houston picked Louis Nix, who missed the season with an injury. Philly picked cornerback Jaylen Watkins and defensive end Taylor Hart, described as “nonentities” in this December piece about Philly whiffing on its 2014 draft. (Translation: Everyone lost! That is one baaaaaaaaad trade.) Q: I’m a Bengals fan. I just realized that the Bengals are movie extras — the movie opponent that the hero team beats in the montage on the way to the big game. 
—Tom P, Cincinnati, Ohio BS: I realized this only after picking them to cover 4 in Indy without A.J. Green, a boneheaded move that earned the following comments from readers: “Can we have you tested for drugs?” … “Picking Dalton to win on the road in the playoffs is like putting an elevator in an outhouse; it just doesn’t belong” … “Can we officially change the phrase from ‘One and Done’ to ‘One and Dalton?” … “Did you throw that pick because you didn’t want to be 4-0 heading into Round 2 and have the Pats blow 11-0 for you?” … “I want to be your bookie — seriously I will book your bets” … and “I’ve been reading your column long enough that I used to print it out from Page 2 so that I could read it during poops as an undergrad. ANDY DALTON!? ON THE ROAD!? IN THE PLAYOFFS!?”1 What really happened: I found out Green was scratched 30 minutes before the column and stupidly thought, I can’t switch now, the column is about to go up! When Cincy ran its first pass play for some beefy white guy that I’d never heard of, I knew it was over. Let’s add this to the Playoff Gambling Manifesto: “If your no. 1 rule is ‘Don’t take a shaky QB on the road,’ and you apply that rule for Ryan Lindley but DON’T apply that rule to Andy Dalton without A.J. Green, then you might need to start downing Adderall like Haloti Ngata before you make next week’s picks.” Q: Any truth to the rumor that Roger Goodell announced the league lost all tapes from the Cowboys-Lions game?
—Jim, Philadelphia, PA BS: The Mueller Report couldn’t find any evidence of this. B.S. Report: Bill Barnwell and J-Bug Bill Barnwell and J-Bug on the NFL playoffs and Boston's Olympic bid 
Q: If the Patriots blow this Ravens game is this the lowest point in Boston Sports, collectively, in the past 10 years? The B’s are almost out of the playoffs after winning the Presidents Trophy last year, and Chiarelli isn’t doing a thing about it, The Sox are going into Spring with five Number 3 pitchers, I don’t even wanna get into the Celtics…
—Thomas Sigler, Gainesville BS: So I guess you’re not excited about the 2024 Summer Olympics? Q: Have you ever been to a party where 100 people show up, but the space provided is only really enough for about 20 of them. And only one person that lives there is actually throwing the party, so pretty much all of the people that live there are pissed off that you are there? And the one person throwing the party doesn’t actually have enough money to fund the party, so they had to ask their roommates (who already didn’t want you there) for money, just pissing them off even more? And the party apartment has furniture oddly place around it so its almost impossible to get around as is, let alone with 80% more people in it? Oh, and those roommates that live there and don’t want you there and are already pissed off? They love to drink. Mostly whiskey. So they are definitely going to abrasively let all the outsiders know how they really feel? I give you #Boston2024.
—Matt, Boston BS: Come on, anytime you can put the Summer Olympics in a city that’s way too cramped to host it, has traffic and subway-related overcrowding problems already, doesn’t have nearly enough facilities, has a legacy of being comically provincial AND a legacy of taking far too long to finish massive rebuilding projects, houses a major league baseball team playing downtown at the exact same time, and doesn’t want to host the Olympics anyway … only the bid is being driven by someone in the construction business, which seems incredibly self-serving given all the construction that’s about to take place … I mean, don’t you have to go for it? What could go wrong? Q: Hey Bill, I knew you were a HUGE Gronkowski fan. I just never pegged you as the type of guy to ghost-write erotica about him.
—Ross, Los Angeles BS: Congrats to Ross for being the 3,000th reader to send me some variation of this joke. Is it weird that “A Gronking To Remember” gave me more confidence that the Patriots could make the Super Bowl? Can’t you see Lacey Noonan at media day trying to get a one-on-one with Gronk as three middle-aged reporters in Hawaiian shirts look on awkwardly? Q: Do you realize that the only playoff game that Aaron Rodgers has won outside of the year he won the Super Bowl was against Joe Webb?
—Christian, Minny BS: That can’t be true. (Looking it up.) My God, that’s true! Q: I watched the first episode of “The Challenge: Battle of the Exes 2” last night and it was obvious that Johnny Bananas went to whatever bar Nany works at, had a “secret hook-up” with her, then leaked it to the producers in order to secure himself a good partner for a future Battle of the Exes season. He probably also located Evelyn and Laurel. Is there any other player/coach/gm in the other four professional major sports that thinks so many moves ahead of his competition?  Only Bill Belichick, who I now refer to as Billy Bananas.
—Mike Renwick, Leominster BS: You don’t have to sell me on the power of Bananas. He’s the Michael Jordan of America’s fifth professional sport. Did you know we invited him to Grantland’s third-anniversary party last summer and asked him to prepare a toast if only because nobody gives better toasts than Johnny Bananas? And that there’s video of this? Without further ado, I present to you Johnny Bananas’s Third-Anniversary Toast, which borrows heavily from the Navy SEALs and might sound a lot like the toast he eventually gave on this week’s Challenge episode:  Q: The NFL just picked up the flag on themselves, after announcing they did something wrong. I am SHOCKED that Mueller cleared the NFL of wrongdoing, shocked.
—Josh, Rye Brook, New York BS: Stop trying to rile me up. I know what you’re doing. Q: So the NFL found that the NFL did not see the Ray Rice video. Did any of us ever consider the idea that maybe they truly haven’t seen the video because Roger Goodell doesn’t know how to open up email attachments?  Nothing would surprise me at this point.
—Sam B, Bartlett, IL BS: It can’t be ruled out. Page 55 of the Mueller Report lays out six different times in February when someone working for Goodell knew about evidence that Rice knocked his wife out, including this tidbit: “On February 21, [NFL VP Adolpho] Birch emailed Goodell, stating, ‘Media today is reporting that there is also video of him delivering the blow that knocked her out.’” And yet, Goodell was allegedly blindsided by the contents of the second elevator video? (Oh, man … now I’m getting riled up … ) Q: Allow a former SuperSonics fan to educate you on sports karma (RIP Sonics!). The Ravens beat the Steelers for the same reason we haven’t yet seen karma completely derail the OKC Thunder (a 2000 Blazers-esque choke is looming … ). Colossal karma for horrific actions and deceitful behavior can only be repaid on the grandest and most public scale. It’s why Webber’s timeout happened in the NCAA Final (not the Sweet Sixteen). It’s why Bo Jackson ran over The Boz on Monday Night Football. It’s why Tiger Woods crashes his car while being chased by his wife toting a 7-iron on Thanksgiving night. For the Ravens it will have to be a grand choke in the AFC championship game or Super Bowl, a fumbled snap recovered and ran back for a touchdown … to lose in overtime. PS: My apologies for not thinking of this connection before your Friday column, my karma warning bells don’t go off until NBA playoffs.
—JJ, Washington, D.C. BS: Intriguing theory! Especially during the same week the NFL released the Mueller Report, a league-funded but “independent” investigation that chronicled a heroic four-month inquiry by the NFL to desperately avoid figuring out what happened in that elevator. (IMPORTANT NOTE: SKIP TO THE NEXT BOLDED EMAIL IF YOU DON’T CARE ABOUT THE MUELLER REPORT.) The report spent an inordinate amount of time trying to disprove an Associated Press article from April 9 (and yes, the AP announced that it’s standing by the story) that painted the NFL’s investigation as incompetent and naive (but apparently blameless), and, of course, neglecting to answer questions including: The Ravens came off worse than anyone — instead of volunteering their evidence, basically, they held on to it and hoped Goodell would never ask. (And he didn’t.) It’s impossible to finish the Mueller Report without thinking that either (a) Goodell and his direct reports are spectacularly incompetent, or (b) Goodell did a favor for his buddy Bisciotti by intentionally burying his head in the sand so Rice’s punishment wouldn’t be that onerous. And it’s clear now that the Ravens need to start firing some of the people who bungled this mess from their end. Maybe the players haven’t entered the Colossal Karma Payback zone, but the organization certainly has. Q: Is there “Sports Czar” system for picking a team to pull for once your team has been eliminated/missed the playoffs? I know you should shift away from rival teams but it seems murky beyond that.
—CJ, Des Moines via Willmar BS: Yeah, the system is called “gambling.” Q: Did you know Tom Brady is 6-7 in his last 13 playoff games? Did you know since 2006 he’s just 2-4 in AFC Championship games and Super Bowls? Did you know Tom Brady has directed 4 of the 12 highest scoring teams in NFL history and that those teams are just 5-4 in the postseason and scored an average of 16.25 points per game in their eventual playoff defeats? Did you know Brady’s regular-season passer rating (95.9) is 8.4 points higher than his playoff rating (87.5)? Did you know Brady has lost playoff games to Jake Plummer, Eli Manning (twice), Mark Sanchez, and Joe Flacco (twice)? Did you know Brady has thrown one touchdown or fewer in half of his playoff starts? Did you know that the Patriots have been favored in every Brady era playoff loss with the exception of last January in Denver? Did you know Brady only has two game winning drives in the playoffs in the last 10 years and in one of them he threw a game ending interception that was fortunately fumbled back to his team? But hey, good luck this weekend.
—Garrison, Indianapolis BS: (Searching for a comeback … ) Q: Just posted on Facebook that this loss and the ability to complain about playoff officiating marks the third best moments of my close to thirty years as a Lions fan. 1. Barry Sanders getting to 2000 yards
 2. First win after the 0-16 season
 3. Inexplicable-Flag-Pick-Up Playoff Game We Lost
 So … yeah.
—Mike, Shanghai Q: I want to say I’m possibly devastated by the Phantom Flag … but who are we kidding? It’s the Lions. Here’s the revised list of the top 5 Lions moments: 1-3. Barry Sanders doing Barry Sanders things.
 4. Calvin Johnson doing Calvin Johnson things.
 5. The Lions selling the Axel Foley Beverly Hills Cop jacket (which they no longer do, but whatever. They still did it!).
 1,000,000. Rod Marinelli doing Rod Marinelli things.
—Brandon D., Massapequa, NY BS: I thought it was fascinating that Lions fans from New York to Shanghai went through the same thought process. Hold on … Q: And to top it off, the Lions don’t even sell the damn Beverly Hills Cop jacket anymore! They took the bar! They took the whole fucking bar!!!
—Brandon, Massapequa, NY BS: The bright side for Lions fans is that it’s hard to get credit for being a tortured fan base without a few heartbreaking/ridiculous/possibly criminal losses. Now, when people discuss the sad fate of Lions fans, they’ll mention the Picked-Up Flag game within the first sentence. And when they’re remembering that game, they won’t mention Caldwell incredibly NOT going for it on the ensuing fourth-and-1, or Sam Martin’s 10-yard punt,3 or the defense giving up a fourth-and-6, or Stafford fumbling twice on the same season-saving drive. Plus, you got hosed during the Year of Goodell! What’s better than that? Q: I’m writing this at 8:04 pm on Sunday night. The DAL-DET game ended about 20 minutes ago. I assume this is the 1,000,000th email you have received about the inevitable Dallas vs Baltimore Super Bowl match-up Roger Goodell is setting up as part of his Worst Commissioner ever heat-check.
—Mike, Goodell’s America BS: See? Cheer up, Lions fans! You can always bounce your grandkids on your lap 40 years from now and tell them your team got hosed during the Worst Commissioner Ever Heat Check season! CLEAR OUT FOR GOODELL, HE’S RED HOT RIGHT NOW! Dear Detroit Fans,
What did you expect?  You’re the Detroit Freaking Lions. You have a team of undisciplined thugs, your quarterback is Jay Cutler 2.0 and whatever (alleged) good Jim Caldwell’s Corpse does off the field he takes it all back with interest on game day. It’s in your team’s DNA to be massively disappointing and then ,on the rare hopeful occasions, to creatively kick their fans in the nuts. It’s what they do. You had literally the ENTIRE second half to prepare for the letdown and you’ve all had YEARS of experience and there were MULTIPLE warnings (flag picked up, shanked punt, Witten’s 4th down, two defensive holdings…). I don’t understand all the angst from the game, at this point it should just be like a bruise that never healed.
Sincerely,
The rest of America P.S. On the bright side, you’re not Cleveland.
—Cameron, Austin BS: OK, so that was mean. Q: We need a name for the transition between the old pre-rules era and today — baseball has the dead ball era (“chicks dig the bunt single”) and the steroid era. “Concussion Era” is too damn morbid, as is “The Pre-Goodell era.” Any suggestions?
—Greg Thomas, Pittsburgh BS: I hope we remember it as the Touch Football era … but I have a feeling we’ll be calling it the Concussion Era. There’s just no way around it. I mean, it’s 2015 and we’re still watching football players seemingly get concussed during games (like Ben Roethlisberger and Heath Miller last weekend), then improbably reenter those games well before we ever could have known if they were actually concussed. What a shocker — Roethlisberger wandered out of a playoff game looking Wooderson-level dazed, abruptly returned and immediately threw a dreadful interception into double coverage. Who could have seen that coming?!?!? It’s like the last decade of research never happened! Keep getting dem checks, National Football League. Q: Wouldn’t it be awesome if Round 2 of the NFL playoffs were “challenge-style”? Why not just let the top seed decide for itself which opponent it wants to face? Imagine the entertainment value. The challenged teams get to spend the week telling us how disrespected they feel, and we get to spend it second-guessing the decisions.
—Eric, Boston BS: I’ve always loved this idea — we would be artificially manufacturing our own “Nobody Believes In Us” scenarios. And yes, if the Patriots had picked Baltimore over Indy as their Round 2 opponent, I would have flipped out. Q: The Simmons Barometer for Life Success. I began reading your work in 1998. Back then I was single and just starting out at work…I would print your articles and read them at my desk — always looking busy of course. I looked forward to consuming as much as you could write. I would click refresh like you were an internet stock. 16 years, 3 kids, 3 companies, and a few tax brackets later, I can’t even get 800 words into your rarely published posts before I give up — who has the time?  Me, 16 years ago. I miss those days…and sleeping in…and going out four nights a week…and smoking indoors…and the possibility of a Lions playoff win.
—Eddie H., Detroit, MI BS: Um … I mean … I guess that was a compliment? Q: Probably just happenstance, but was it?  I clicked on your Youtube link in the Cardinals/Panthers prediction, and the commercial that played before the video was UNBELIEVABLE. It was a 2 minute mini-infomercial for Poo Pourri, a real product used to mask the smell of … its namesake. Opening line?  “You would not BELIEVE the motherlode I just dropped!”
—Bill Stacey, Ann Arbor BS: That Poo Pourri ad has been replaced by a never-ending loop of Drew Butler shanking punts to a skittish Brenton Bersin. That reminds me, here’s the Shakey’s Pizza Watch coming out of Round 1: the Lions-Cowboys officiating crew picking up that P.I. flag AFTER it has been announced (never seen that before) … Todd Haley’s crap game plan for Round 1 (and Todd Haley in general) … the inevitable Boom Herron fumble … this owner’s box celebration picture from Sunday’s Lions-Cowboys game … Cam Newton’s body language and accuracy … Peyton Manning in cold weather … Aaron Rodgers with a bad wheel in cold weather … Tom Brady in cold weather … any old or injured QB in cold weather … Logan Thomas (because if he can’t beat out Ryan Lindley, then wow) … Marvin Lewis’s playoff résumé (0-6 in playoffs, never scored 17-plus points, lost to Sanchez and T.J. Yates, outscored 84-13 in second halves, never CLOSE to winning) … Big Ben’s concussion “test” … T.Y. Hilton’s case of the dropsies … Jason Garrett’s psychotic victory smile that’s vaguely reminiscent of Brody losing his mind during Season 1 of Homeland. Q: Was Jerry Jones’ celebration with Gov. Christie the most awkward white guy celebration of all time?
—Fahad Z, Chicago BS: Yes. But not THE most awkward celebration of all time.  Q: Dogs are the ultimate irrational confidence guys. Think about it. My dog is pretty large, a 70-lb lab mix, and every time he sees a horse he flips out and would completely try to take that horse out even though he would probably get stomped to death. On our daily walks, there is inevitably some chihuahua or other yappy breed that tries to take him on despite the fact they’d get killed in an instant if it came to it. Dogs are the Sam Cassells of the animal kingdom.
—Aaron, Denver BS: Yup, these are my readers. Let’s get to the Round 2 picks. (Home teams in CAPS.) Three Playoff Manifesto rules in play here: “Don’t Pick A Road Underdog Unless You Think They Have A Genuine Chance To Win,” “Beware Of Aging QBs In Cold Weather,” and “Beware Of The Wonk Team.” For the record, I hate cold-weather playoff games for home teams. It murders the crowd. Just takes ’em right out. Everyone is freezing their asses off, everyone’s covered in thick jackets and scarves and ski masks and huge hats, everyone’s wearing heavy gloves or mittens so their hands can’t generate any noise, and everyone’s faces are too frozen to cheer loudly. It’s like playing the game in a neutral field. Eleven years ago, a superb Patriots team nearly blew a Round 2 home game to Tennessee because of the freezing conditions … and would have, if it weren’t for the great Adam Vinatieri kicking the football/rock 46 yards for the game-winning field goal. Here’s how my buddy J-Bug (a longtime Pats season-ticket holder) described that game in my ensuing column: Wild Turkey was going down like Bud Light. There was no other way. I wore my leather pants and they were a conversation piece for their functionality, not fashion. The crowd was excited and subdued at the same time, if that is at all possible. My friend Bob was drinking Corona; and the beer was freezing inside the neck of the bottle so that by the time you had two sips left, it could barely make it through the ice formation that began at neck and finished at the lip. For smokers, the list of dangers grew by one, because you had to take your mittens off to grip your butt, anything over three minutes exposed ran the risk of frostbite; and yes, I am serious. You don’t even want to know about the shrinkage factor in the port-o-john — I think it actually inverted into my body. Toward the end, I became delusional and started rambling on about how there are billions of people in the world and only 70K of them were at the game, and how we were superior beings because of this. Spit was flying out of my mouth and freezing in mid air, so it pelted, rather than dribbled, all over my friends — it was like phlegm balls of sleet. When I mentioned that I felt like Robert the Bruce at the end of Braveheart, that’s when my friend Niko took my car keys and assumed responsibility for the evening. That’s a home-field advantage? Even if 2015 Pats-Ravens won’t be as bone-chillingly cold as 2004 Pats-Titans, temperatures will dip into the teens once night falls. That kills the atmosphere at least a little. And if you don’t think I’m worried about my late-thirties QB getting knocked around on a rock-hard field, then you don’t know me well enough. Feels like a 20-17 type of game — one of those games that gets decided by a pass-interference play, a turnover, a special teams return and a long field goal. And what really frightens me is that the Ravens are better built to win a game like that. I want to throw up. In Belichick We Trust. The Pick: Patriots 20, Ravens 17 (Ravens cover) Your classic Gus Ramsey Game, named after my buddy Gus for all the times he’d study a football game between a good-to-great defense playing home against a bad-to-shaky offense and wonder, “Seriously, how many points are they gonna score in this game?” That minus-11 seems high until you remember how banged up Cam Newton looked last weekend, or how bad his body language looked (little-known fact: It was so bad that the Cleveland Cavaliers are now thinking about signing him), or how many of his passes sailed away from his targets. You can’t play that way in Seattle, and you definitely can’t play that way against Seattle’s ball-hawking secondary. Throw in Beast Mode running all over Carolina’s secretly shaky run defense, sprinkle in some CenturyLink Field acoustics, add two backbreaking Russell Wilson plays and a defensive TD, and … well … The Pick: Seattle 30, Carolina 3 So Aaron Rodgers is nursing a partially torn calf muscle in frigid weather against a talented Cowboys team with a top-five QB who’s 8-0 on the road … and the line is higher than four points? I don’t get it. My biggest fear with this pick: I also could have written “So Tony Romo is nursing a bad back in frigid weather against a loaded Packers offense that’s 8-0 at Lambeau … and the line is less than seven points? I don’t get it.” My second-biggest fear with this pick: The Cowboys looked a little too happy to be there after pulling that Lions game out of their asses. Not sure you should be reacting to a backdoor Round 1 victory at home like you just won the Super Bowl. That scared me. But this feels like a tight game if only because Lambeau won’t totally feel like Lambeau with the bundled-up fans shivering their asses off. And no, I’m not ready to officially add this axiom to the Playoff Gambling Manifesto yet: “Anytime you have two relatively close playoff teams battling in booger-freezing weather, and you can grab more than four points, just do it without overthinking it.” But if the Ravens and Cowboys cover this weekend? Then yes. (Thinking.) You know what? Screw it. The Pick: Cowboys 24, Packers 22 You know it, you love it, you’ve won money from it … what’s better than everyone overreacting because a flawed playoff team looked better than it actually is in Round 1? The Colts have a lousy running game. They make way too many mistakes. They were absolutely torched during the season by high-caliber offenses. They were 2014’s Good Bad Team — a.k.a. the team that looks good against everyone except another good team. And if you’re picking them to cover in Denver, you’re banking on two things: an iconic, out-of-his-mind, LeBron-dropping-48-on-the-2007-Pistons-type performance from Andrew Luck (can’t be ruled out) and a creaky Peyton Manning falling apart in not-that-cold weather to the point that you’ll get flashbacks to this …  I don’t think the Colts can run on Denver even a little, and I think Denver CAN run on the Colts. I think Luck makes mistakes when you pressure him … and Denver will be able to pressure him. I think we forget how good Denver is when they have the Thomas Brothers, Emmanuel Sanders and C.J. Anderson humming together. I don’t like laying points in playoff games between two relatively equal teams … but these two teams aren’t relatively equal. Booyah. The Pick: Denver 31, Indy 20 Playoffs: 1-3

183,That Championship Mailbag: 2015 Edition,"If you missed my Friday piece about the Brady-Manning rivalry and the hidden meaning of last Saturday’s dramatic Patriots win, CLICK HERE. Before my Round 3 picks, let’s tackle actual emails from actual readers. Q: How would Peyton Manning’s retirement affect the TV commercial landscape? Every third non-Cialis commercial features Peyton Manning. If Manning retires one of two things will happen: 1) he has MORE time to film commercials (“Hi, I’m Peyton Manning, if you’ve had your ass kicked in the playoffs as much I have, then you’ll appreciate the cool, soothing relief of Preparation H”) or 2) a void is created. So what NFL player will fill that void? Master thespian Aaron Rodgers can’t out-act two-by-fours. Your top 5 candidates?
—Steve Glaros, Riverdale Park, MD BS: Fantastic question. First of all, Manning isn’t going away — if he leaves football, he’s making up that whopping salary with a TV gig (and he’d be the highest-paid TV guy since Madden, not to mention the biggest sure thing since Strahan), as well as even MORE commercials. Given what we’ve seen from Joe Montana, Brett Favre and others, as well as the post-1998 Michael Jordan, sponsors won’t care if Manning retires. His Q rating won’t budge. As long as he’s likable, they’ll be cutting him checks. Chicken parm, you taste so good …  As for active players, Rodgers is like the Ryan Reynolds of NFL pitchmen — he’s just going to keep getting gigs three years after we realize that it’s not working out. I can’t see him losing pole position, though. Wilson and Luck aren’t ready yet. Brady doesn’t want it. J.J. Watt isn’t recognizable enough. There’s one dark horse for the Manning Alpha Dog Ad Spot, though. If the Patriots somehow win two more games, I mean …  Q: Could it be the Year of Gronk? He hasn’t been this healthy since 2011. He’s single handedly transformed the Pats offense into a Super Bowl offense and helped save Brady’s career. Someone wrote a freaking erotic novel written about him. Even the Wonk Team (Baltimore) couldn’t stop the Year of Gronk. And the Super Bowl is in Arizona this year. The same place where one Robert Paxton Gronkowski attended college. TELL ME ITS NOT THE YEAR OF GRONK!!!!!
—Will, New York More on the Super Bowl Barnwell’s Super Bowl Breakdown Belichick: The Great Defender Giving Vince Wilfork His Due Marshawn Lynch and the Media Cousin Sal’s SB Prop Bets Beware the Visor: Kam Chancellor Among the Lurchers at Media Day Pats and Seahawks Weaknesses NFL Defense Championship Belt Matthew Slater: Mr. Special Teams Story of the First Tackle How Belichick Rules the Draft ‘You Mad, Bro?’ Revisited Pierce on the Deflatriots Farce The Pats’ Homegrown Linebackers More on the Super Bowl BS: Combined with my previous mailbag answer, we’re suddenly battling so many different jinxing implications that I might have to cleanse myself in a hot bath, cover myself in rosary beads and give myself a concussion to forget this whole sequence happened. This is NOT the Year of Gronk. (Monotone voice.) On to Indianapolis. On to Indianapolis. On to Indianapolis. Q: After watching the Golden Globes with my wife, I have no doubt that Amal Clooney is on the Mt. Rushmore of women that women love to hate. Can I get a confirmation on this? 
—Kotite, Phoenix BS: No question. It’s her, Gwyneth Paltrow, Anne Hathaway and Jenny McCarthy right now. If that were the new cast for The View, they’d have to change the name of the show to Hate-Watch. Q: The Pistons cut Josh Smith. The Pistons win six1 straight games. The Colts make Trent Richardson a healthy scratch. The Colts manhandle the Broncos. Are you afraid that the Colts benching of T-Rich is going to propel them to a Super Bowl? Also if this happens can we officially coin the Josh Smith theory as a derivative of the Ewing theory?
—Bryan K., Half Moon Bay, CA BS: You just mentioned one of the two non-football reasons that I am frightened of the Colts on Sunday. Q: With each passing year, John Elway and Ric Flair are looking more and more alike. How long until Elway starts showing up to interviews with the Four Horsemen?
—Pat, Portland, ME BS: And here’s the other non-football reason. It scares the crap out of me that the Colts have been ripping off Flair’s iconic 1980s “Rolex-wearing” interview …2  … with safety Sergio Brown as their postgame locker-room victory routine.  You know what Clairvoyant Bill doesn’t like? The thought of Indy shocking the Patriots this weekend, Sergio Brown doing that speech one more time, then Super Bowl week rolling around and Ric Flair showing up with the announcement that, if the Colts win the whole thing, RIC FLAIR will be doing that locker-room routine with Brown. CLAIRVOYANT BILL IS FRIGHTENED OF THIS ENTIRE HYPOTHETICAL SEQUENCE. IT’S THE KIND OF GOOFY SUBPLOT THAT ALWAYS SEEMS TO HAPPEN TO UPSTART TEAMS THAT MAKE AND WIN SUPER BOWLS. MY CAPS LOCK IS NOT BROKEN. DAMMIT. DAMMIT. I HATE THIS RIC FLAIR THING. DAMMIT. DAMMIT!!!!! Q: So during the Bountygate investigation, Goodell did everything short of asking Gregg Williams’ grade school teachers if he was troublesome as a child. BUT during the Rice investigation, while getting a hot dog and beer at the turn before 10, Goodell couldn’t turn to Bisciotti and say, “Hey Steve, do you guys have the elevator tape?”
—Kyle, Bowie, MD BS: Yup. Pretty much. Q: I’ve been waiting years for the Colts-Patriots to play in the AFC Championship again just so Vinatieri can purposely shank a game tying 25-yard field goal in the closing seconds, rip off his jersey revealing a Pats jersey underneath, and run over to kneel in front of a cackling Belichick.
—Adam, Norfolk BS: Adam Vinatieri is in the building! Get ’em, Adam! Go get ’em, baby! Oh, oh, oh … what is he doing??? What the hell is going on here?????  Q: Can we get someone to figure out what Mike Carey’s percentage is when has CBS cut to him for his take on a replay? Is it higher than 25 percent?
—Billy B, Fresh Meadows, NY BS: I’d set the over/under at 32.5 percent, and I’m going under. Hopefully Carey’s struggles are leading to CBS dumping Mike Carey and hiring Jerome Boger, then dressing him up like Tim Meadows from The Ladies Man for every ruling. Q: You had two Mike’s from Shanghai in your last mailbag. I do not believe it. Post this to prove me wrong that you aren’t just making emails up!
—Mike, Shanghai BS: I thought it was a copy-paste mistake, but we searched my reader e-mail account for “Shanghai” since December and THREE different “Mike from Shanghai” email addresses came up. How are there three Mikes from Shanghai who read my column? How is there anyone from Shanghai reading my column? The Shanghai Sports Guy must really be slipping. Q: Ray Lewis comes out and says if not for the Tuck Rule we’d never have heard of Tom Brady??? Even if the Pats lose that game what about 03? and 04?? Someone remind Lewis that Deer Antler spray was legal at the time he used it, then the NFL made it illegal. Does that make his 2012 comeback “made up” or fake? What a chump. I’m not a big guy but I’d say that to his face no matter what occurs afterwards, then I’d laugh at him Fight Club style after getting my face pounded in.
—Chad, Olympia, WA BS: (Afraid to say anything.) Q: Joe Buck compared Aaron Rodgers playing QB with a pulled calf to Willis Reed playing in the NBA Finals with a broken leg and Tiger Woods winning the US Open with a fractured leg and torn knee. Joe Buck sucks ass.
—Mark, Vancouver BS: (Nervously glancing around.) Q: My wife who doesn’t normally watch football games with me came downstairs while I was watching the Seattle and Carolina game. After a couple of big physical plays and a Marshawn Lynch run, she asked, “What are they feeding those guys in Seattle?” I didn’t say anything, there was a long pause, and then she added, “We should really eat more salmon.” I thought to myself, yeah, that’s it. It’s the salmon. Do you think it’s possible that LeBron excluded salmon from his summer diet?
—Daniel B, New Port Richey, FL BS: (Unable to breathe.) Q: Why are you lumping golf celebrations into the Chris Christie/Jerry Jones Power Love-In for Awkward White Guy celebrations? They’re just in a different class.  —Andrew, Toronto BS: Wow, you went with Azinger and left me David Duval’s career-ending double-fist-pump debacle? A curious move by Andrew from Toronto!  Still, Rachel in Edmonton sent me the funniest celebration on YouTube — a gamer battling (and losing) to a champagne bottle after winning one of the world’s biggest e-sports tournaments. This is just remarkable footage. I almost didn’t embed it because I’m worried you won’t be able to concentrate on the rest of the mailbag now. Whatever.  Q: If you’re worried about Boston hosting the Olympics, don’t be! Look, here’s a picture I just took of our commuter line tracks on fire — while it’s snowing! WE GOT THIS!!!!!!!
—Quentin, Boston BS: Boston’s Olympic slogan should definitely be, “Boston 2024: NOBODY BELIEVES IN US!!!” Q: Just wanted to thank you for the Johnny Bananas toast video. We have three girls in our group of friends who are nicknamed Jenny Bananas, Chloe Bananas, and Jill Bananas — all because they’ve hooked up with him at some point during the past eight years. How impressive is it that a guy can hook up with a girl and instantly give that girl the nickname of “first-name Bananas”?
—Austin, Boone, NC BS: It’s certainly better than about 20 other things he could give them. Why Grantland hasn’t launched “Story Time With Johnny Bananas” is one of the great mysteries of life. By the way, I’ve been watching America’s Fifth Pro Sport (The Challenge) and think we should induct Nany into The Bunim/Murray Hall of Fame if only for these two moments: (1) She couldn’t figure out which “ex” MTV was pairing her with because there were too many possibilities, and (2) she said the words, “And me not having any self-respect — why does this bother you?” Nany is the J.J. Watt of The Challenge — every season, she’s a little more superhuman. Let’s hope they never meet. Q: Certain athletes are terrifying because their level of intensity will not allow them to be defeated. In big moments, it transforms into a rage and aggression that is truly special to watch. We’ve seen it with guys such as Rafael Nadal, Russell Westbrook, and J.J. Watt, who can just out-muscle, out-heart, and out-psycho anyone who gets in their way like a lion or rhino or something. As much as it kills me to say it, when Tom Brady gets in his F-bomb dropping, head-butting mode, he has to be included in this list. Even with the Ravens up 14, I knew Brady would go on a rampage eventually. But the Pats won’t win it all, because the way I just described Brady is basically the ENTIRE SEATTLE DEFENSE. For now, just take the points and enjoy this Sunday, because I think they are going to massacre the Colts and get back to the Super Bowl.
—Taylor, Patchogue, NY BS: A rarely seen short-term jinx coupled with a long-term nobody-believes-in-you reverse jinx. Stop toying with my emotions, Taylor in Patchogue. And pass the salmon, Seattle’s defense. Q: I am curious, are you a freemason? The reason I ask is that you have a column about “the triangle” on your website, and you have a “G” for Grantland as your emblem. Both of those are freemason symbols. You also had the “pyramid” of great players in your book. If you are unfamiliar with freemasonry, you can check on the internet to see that both those symbols are associated with freemasonry. Their main symbol in fact is a compass and square with a capital G in the middle. Maybe I am reading too much into the symbols, not sure. Take care.
—Andy, San Mateo BS: I checked it out and … um … NO! I am not a freemason! Or, am I secretly a freemason and never realized it, but it’s been unwittingly seeping out of me? What the hell????? Why did you plant this in my head? How did I become a freemason? What are my next steps? Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh! Q: Have you ever seen a group of players more unsure about when to give up than the Broncos offense at the end of their playoff game? Half the team is trying to run a no huddle, and the wide receivers are dicking around five yards past the line of scrimmage. Then when they finally catch a pass, they try like all hell to stay in bounds so the game will just be over. What the hell was that?
—David, Ann Arbor BS: That was called “The Denver Broncos and coach John Fox have mutually agreed to part ways.” Q: Go back and watch Peyton Manning’s fumble (against Indy) again. Manning makes zero real effort to get the ball back, meaningfully block defensive players away, or otherwise influence who gets possession of the fumble. Watching that play I felt like Peyton — the quintessential competitor — was done with football. Brady meanwhile is full of the piss and gall to scream after every big play, get in the face of larger competitors, and spike TDs like a 22 year old. One looks done, one is going to play with the same spirit until he “sucks.”
—Adam Benson, Butte BS: Agree — that was the defining “I’m old, I’m banged-up, get me out of here” sequence. But the degree of difficulty for Manning’s 2012-14 comeback doesn’t get enough credit. Four neck surgeries???? Expecting three healthy Denver seasons from him, in retrospect, was more than a little unrealistic. It’s a little like Kobe’s 2014-15 season right now — doesn’t it seem foolish that we thought Kobe could return from a torn Achilles tendon and what amounted to being a 20-month layoff, at age 36, with over 55,000 NBA minutes/miles on him, as if nothing ever happened? I always revered a then-crippled Larry Bird for gutting his way through those last two Celtics seasons with the 25-pound back brace; it wasn’t much different from what Manning just did. Seems like we keep forgetting this. Q: As one of the “enemy,” I thought it would be hard to write this, but Manning’s debacle on Sunday actually gave me some peace. It’s over. All the late-season offensive tinkering was to cover that my man was falling apart. He’s not coming back, nor should he. The thing I always loved about Manning is that he shouldn’t have been that good in first place. … What Manning addicts like myself have to realize at some point is that he’s a front-runner (like Tiger Woods). He’s all timing and routes and precision, a beautiful science project. But when things go wrong in the playoffs, as they always do, he will force things and make mistakes. And lose. I don’t think Brady is all that “clutch” either, but he’s a lot closer to it than Peyton. But F— it: I like my heroes flawed.
—Justin, Los Angeles BS: That might have been the longest and most eloquent backhanded compliment in mailbag history. But Manning was better than you’re saying. Every great QB has flaws. Marino and Warner couldn’t move. Rodgers can be beaten up, like Montana back in the day. Elway and Favre were too careless. Eli Manning couldn’t find the giant horseshoe that was crammed up his butt until January and February. You could nitpick every great guy. Q: Tim Tebow averaged one playoff win per season during his tenure as the starting QB for the Broncos. Peyton Manning averages 2/3 of a playoff win per season during his tenure as the starting QB of the Broncos. Just passing along that fact.
—Aaron W., Miami BS: TEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE-BOWWWWWWWWWWWWWW!!!!!!!!!!!!! Q: Seriously though, why is Tebow not in the NFL? Ryan f’ing Lindley just started a playoff game in which 43-year old Kurt Warner was somewhat hoping for a phone call from the Cardinals brass asking him to make a return. It’s time for a GM or coach to pick up the phone, right? What am I missing?
—Aaron W., Miami BS: You’re not missing anything! TEEEEEEEEEEEEEE-BOWWWWWWWWWWWWW!!!!!! For God’s sake, we just lost two more starting QBs (Kyle Orton and probably Manning), and we have more up-in-the-air-QB teams (Cleveland, Tampa, Tennessee, Buffalo, Jacksonville, the Jets, maybe Denver, maybe Washington) than incoming rookie saviors. The QB pool is like the beach in Southern California: It recedes a little more every year. I refuse to believe that Tebow is worse than five Opening Day starters next season. He won a playoff game! Q: How about that strategically placed tidbit, right as the Monday Morning newscycle was starting up, that “sources” said Manning was playing with a torn quadricep? Why is it never Peyton Manning’s fault? 
—Kevin B., Los Angeles BS: Helping your case: Two different reporters disagreed and said Manning did NOT have a tear, just a strain in one or both legs. But if NFL teams are supposed to report every injury, why didn’t the Broncos report Manning’s “torn” quadriceps? What about my three-team tease that Denver blew on Sunday because I didn’t know that Sure Thing Denver had a one-legged quarterback? The NFL fines teams for not reporting injuries, but it didn’t fine Denver for not reporting THE biggest injury? Regardless, let’s stop piling on Peyton. The man had an extraordinary career. Q: “Hi, I’m Rob Lowe and I have directtv.” “And I’m Peyton Manning Face Rob Lowe and I have cable.”
—Ryan B., Crofton MD BS: Seriously, let’s scale it back a notch. Q: You wrote: “If they ever held the Greatest “Mic’d Up” Players Ever tournament, Steve Smith and J.J. Watt would be the no. 1 seeds.” How can you not mention Matthew Stafford in this? He’s always mic’d up in the best games! Like the comeback vs. Cleveland where he broke his shoulder, or the wild-card game this year vs. the Cowboys. He even has his own Reddit thread!
—Mike, Rochester, NY Q: Let’s get the Grantland interns on this right away. We demand the Greatest “Mic’d Up” Players ever tournament. With 64 entries, 4 brackets … c’mon, you know how this works. I already envision an Elite Eight of John Randle vs. Shannon Sharpe, Steve Smith vs. Ray Lewis, Mike Singletary vs. (the original) Hank Stram and Terrell Owens vs. J.J. Watt.
—Bill Anderson, Suwanee BS: I went and found those hyperlinks for you, America. Just because I love you. You’d also have to consider the following guys to crash the Final Eight: Stafford, Ed Reed (this is great), Bum Phillips, Lawrence Taylor, Michael Strahan, Jerry Glanville, Brett Favre, Richard Sherman and Jay Cutler (just for the Brandon Marshall moments) … I mean, he’s right. This really could be the next Grantland Bracket. Q: Like you, I was amazed by Al Michaels’ and Cris Collingsworth’s description of Goodell and the Mueller report. It seemed to be in the line of a North Korean newscaster commenting on Kim Jong Un. It got me thinking: what would the best ludicrous claim the duo could make during the Super Bowl telecast? If they said, “We played 18 holes with Goodell this week — he shot a 31,” would that be more or less believable than what they said during the Pats/Ravens game?
—Perry, Monterey BS: That would be a hilarious SNL sketch — Michaels and Collinsworth saying increasingly crazy praise-worthy things about Goodell as the camera scaled back to reveal NFL and NBC executives pointing guns at them. Don’t worry, I am getting Al Michaels on a B.S. Report soon. We’re getting the real story. Maybe they didn’t have time to read the whole Mueller Report. Maybe they were told to do that … or else. Maybe they just weren’t educated enough about the whole story. But to briskly read through the “highlights” of Goodell’s “exoneration” from the Mueller Report without mentioning all the different ways that same report made him look (fill in a word: incompetent, bumbling, shady, nefarious, deceitful), or mentioning that the report specifically said that Goodell didn’t tell the truth in his September 10 memo to the 32 owners … I mean, come on. Q: The dumbest thing I keep hearing about Russell Wilson is that “he’s not asked to do much.” He does EVERYTHING for the Hawks. Marshawn is a huge weapon but carries the ball less than 20 times a game on average. People aren’t used to seeing a QB doing what Wilson does. He really has no o-line, yet he almost never makes a bad decision and accrues massive amounts of yardage. Wilson gained 4,324 passing/rushing yards this season, as opposed to 4,168 passing/rushing yards from Brady. Does it really matter how they got the yards? He’s not asked to do less things, he’s just asked to do different things.
—Brian, New Jersey BS: That’s a really smart point. And there’s also a chance — like Brady in 2001 and 2003 — that Wilson COULD do more, but he’s a little limited by the available receiver options. He’s a superb quarterback. I’m terrified of him. There’s only one Wilson flaw right now: Every interview makes me wonder if he’s the lost Will Smith–Jada Pinkett kid. He’s so serenely perfect and well mannered that it creeps me out.3 Every great QB also seemed like a fun hang and someone who wasn’t afraid to let loose. Can you imagine, say, driving cross-country with Russell Wilson? You: Sorry, man, I just farted. Russell (smiling): That’s fine. You: Roll down your window if you want. Russell (smiling): It’s OK, don’t worry about it. You: You haven’t farted this whole trip. Have you ever farted? Russell (smiling): Not really. (Dead silence.) You: Hey, you hungry? Should we stop for food? Russell (smiling): Yeah, if you want. You: Are you hungry? Russell (smiling): It doesn’t matter, whatever. (Dead silence.) Q: On a scale of zero to Mercury Morris dying of mercury poisoning,4how ironic is it that the Cowboys lost the game due to the Calvin Johnson Rule? —Bill S., Ludington, MI BS: It’s way, way, way, way up there. My quickie take: That was the correct interpretation of an excruciatingly bad rule. But the Cowboys didn’t play well enough to win, either. You have to BEAT Green Bay in Lambeau. Remember that third-and-1 near the end of the first half, in two-down territory, when they threw an incompletion, got the penalty on the field goal try, then missed the field goal and allowed Green Bay to get three points out of it? That’s when they blew the game. If you can’t get one yard with DeMarco Murray in two tries, then you don’t deserve to win. They got too cute. I thought the right team won. Rodgers owned the second half; even if the Dez catch counts, Rodgers still rolls down and scores. The first half was when Dallas could have put the Packers away — or come close. Q: I hope the DVD cover of The Missing Rings: 2014 Dallas Cowboys is a picture of sad Chris Christie slumped over a plate of half-eaten onion rings.
—Danny A., Springfield, NJ BS: Serious question: Could Chris Christie be intentionally trying to lower everyone’s opinion of him so he can rally back as 2016’s “Nobody Believes In Me” candidate? This is all leading to our Nobody Believed In Him president lighting the torch in our Nobody Believed In Us Olympic city. I can feel it. Q: You know what the Dez Bryant play was like? Driving down the highway in the middle lane when some rich a-hole blows by you in a Maserati going 110 mph. Perturbed, you keep driving up the road and smoky bear has the guy pulled over writing him a huge ticket. These moments don’t happen often and you have to savor them.
—John Herndon, Giants Fan, Westfield, Indiana BS: And you left out the best part: Everyone who wagered on the Cowboys +6 clinched their bet thanks to Green Bay’s failed two-point conversion from earlier. (That was one of my favorite gambling wins in awhile.) I felt bad for Dez in this respect — if he hadn’t made the mistake of dipping the ball against the ground for 0.00004 seconds and Dallas had somehow held off Rodgers for the emotional win, that would’ve become a LEGENDARY catch. An all-timer, even. He did everything right … except for that split second when he reached for the end zone. Q: You remember how you told everyone that you would give them a gift, and that shit gift was the Steelers to win the Super Bowl at 18/1 odds. Are you kidding me? That was the worst gift since I got roach killer as a stocking stuffer from my Percocet popping Grandma.
—Hector BS: Had Todd Haley given up on his running game, spread the field and chucked it every down against that sketchy Ravens secondary like the Patriots did, we’d probably be talking about Steelers-Patriots right now. Blame Todd Haley! He’s the Percocet-popping grandma in this scenario, not me! Q: What if Joe Flacco’s annual New Years resolution is just to be better at football? Then come September, just as with everyone else and their resolutions, he has given up and is back to being a regular Joe?
—Jake Wall, London  BS: Maybe that should be his nickname — New Year’s Joe. That’s the funniest Flacco email I received last weekend except for the guy who spent a paragraph comparing Flacco to Michael Myers, right down to his “dead eyes.” When you can be successfully compared to a fictional serial killer, you know you’re making an impact as a playoff QB. New Year’s Joe Flacco, you still scare the shit out of me. Q: On the final interception, I think every Raven fan’s mouth just dropped open with a constant flow of why’s. Why go for it all and leave Brady time? Why? I think the answer is Joe Flacco went into Horry/Cassell mode and thought “I’m Joe f–king Flacco, and this is what I do.” I’ve watched it 20 times and he’s locked in on that safety as soon as the ball is snapped. He has Marlon Brown across the middle for a first down and never even thought about it. The playoffs had just taught him it would work out, and it didn’t. Saw this interview this morning and it confirms that. Gotta love and hate the guy who can throw a season ending interception and let you know he’s seen the coverage before, knew he was throwing into double coverage, and just thought it would work out.
—Zach, Austin BS: There’s no question. That throw reminded me of Jason Terry’s back-breaking 3 in the 2011 NBA Finals: I AM JASON F-?-?-?ING TERRY AND F-?-?-? IT, I AM JUST SHOOTING THIS!!!!!  Totally in character, just like Flacco going for the kill was totally in character. That Ravens-Pats game couldn’t have ended any other way. And actually, it didn’t end that way — the Patriots screwed up their clock-wasting strategy, forgot to run sweeps and somehow left the Ravens with a punt return and a Hail Mary. (Important note: Every Pats fan has quietly agreed to never discuss those 99 seconds again. It’s like how fans of The Sopranos conveniently forget the Italian American parade episode during every “David Chase is a genius” conversation. Those 99 seconds never happened.) Q: I’m gonna remember that split second with everyone I was watching when we realized Edelman was gonna throw for the rest of my life. Go Pats.
—Mike Schaub, Ball So Hard University Q: I waited five years for McDaniels to finally call that bubble screen lateral and pass for Edelman.
—Kyle, Madrid, Spain Q: You always write about the QB position and how its 75% charisma and character and 25% skill and stuff like that. Let’s give Brandon LaFell a chance to share his feelings about his QB: “It felt like a long day in practice: Everybody is tired, everybody is complaining, and you look at Tom, and he’s just calm. He’s putting us in the right plays, and he’s just going out there spreading the ball around and making plays for us. When you look that calm, and he’s just smooth out there, it calms you down and gives you confidence to make plays.” (And then … ) “I told him after the game [how much I appreciated him]. I told him, ‘I’ve seen guys throw interceptions before the half and they just went in the tank, but you didn’t do that, man. You led us, you kept preaching, you kept leading.’” That’s #12, the guy that plays QB for the team I love.
—James, Boston BS: Patriots fans are a little gooey right now. I apologize. Q: So I’m listening to you and Klosterman talk about Leo and how he’s on his third generation of supermodels because of the Titanic trump card … I’m sure that’s part of it, but at what point do we have to start throwing out Gladwell’s 10,000 hours outlier theory? The man has actively been pursuing and dating super models without interruption for 20 years. At this point, Leonardo Dicaprio probably feels more comfortable talking to a Victoria’s secret model than I would talking to a grocery store clerk. Did you see he convinced no less than 20 supermodels to leave the club with him last month?? point being, there’s a good chance Leo’s spent more hours talking to and picking up supermodels than Dirk Nowitzki has spent shooting jump shots.
—Leo, Portland BS: Here’s what Gladwell had to say … “I think Leo’s situation is not dissimilar to the Jamaican-sprinting question. Jamaica, a country one-tenth the size of Cuba, has now produced the world’s best sprinters for the past generation in numbers that defy all logic. Here, for example, are the results of the high school boys’ 100-meter finals from last year’s Jamaican Boys & Girls Athletics Championships: “For those who are not track fans, I should point out that this final is probably faster than the ADULT national finals in virtually every country in the world except the United States. So why are the Jamaicans so good? There are many reasons, but the simplest is that the effect of peers on high performance is REALLY strong. In Jamaica, EVERYONE sprints. There are 20 heats in the 100-meter regional championships. And because everyone sprints, and the average quality of sprinting is so high, everyone’s expectations are raised accordingly. The psychological ceiling on elite performance if you are a high school sprinter in Kingston is, like, a foot higher than if you are a high school sprinter in America. Leo is the Jamaican sprinter of ladies’ men. The average Don Juan gets to practice his A-game maybe once a month. Leo can’t EVER take a night off. He’s been competing with the very best for 20 years. I don’t know if he remembers what it’s like not to be charming.” (Did that settle it?) Q: Liked your piece on Joe Flacco. But in the latest close playoff game, the Ravens were beaten at the line of scrimmage with subtle diversion or confusion. Hoodie is a master tactician. When Flacco was written off, I always knew he would eventually come through as a top tier QB. Italian-Americans consistently coming through in the clutch in sports history is no fluke. It’s a sociological byproduct of marginalization. Happens all the time in baseball. 
—Henry, Los Angeles, CA BS: My mother is 100 percent Italian — I’d like to thank Henry for being able to replicate, almost to the word, something my Uncle Ricky would have said at Thanksgiving dinner after five glasses of chianti. This was amazing. By the way, we might be in range. Q: I’m in ninth grade, and I’m reading Animal Farm in my english class. We’re about eight chapters in, and I’m starting to realize there are some interesting similarities between the pigs in the book and Roger Goodell. The Pigs have taken over the farm, and are treating the other animals unfairly. The farm has seven commandments, many that go against humans and their ways. The pigs, the leaders on the farm, keep breaking them, then change them to their benefit. The other animals on the farm seem okay with them breaking the rules unless they change the commandment, making it okay. They’re brainwashed, pretty much. With Roger Goodell, he is changing the rules and lying. The pigs are lying to the other animals, while Goodell is lying to us. He (Goodell) then changes the rules to his and the NFL’s advantage. The only difference is, in Animal Farm, the other animals on the farm don’t know the pigs are lying and that they’re changing the rules to their benefit. In the NFL, we know what’s going on, and we know Goodell is lying.
—Hunter H., Twin Cities, MN BS: We’re definitely in range. Q: After your shout-out to Delaware in your Two Flaccos column, it is only fitting that a Delaware High School (Caesar Rodney) graduate, Duron Harmon, picked Flacco off on the game’s deciding play. That fact broke Delaware Twitter. Not much happens here.
—Andrew, Wilmington BS: Getting closer … Q: I loved your take in the Klosterman podcast about Unbroken. My favorite pastime is tricking my wife into watching the movie I want to see by rejecting her first couple of suggestions (that I really wouldn’t mind seeing), feinting interest on movies (that I really don’t want to see), and eventually steering her toward the weird/nerdy or not promoted movie I think we will both like. Recently this worked with Birdman and Interstellar, both of which we both like. Unbroken was the worst movie experience of my life. Who wants to go see somewhat get tortured for two hours with the only payoff a still image “where are they now” ending. My wife was sooooooo pissed we wasted the babysitter time and has blamed me for a week. I am pretty sure she is now depressed, and it has affected my sex life. Thank goodness I smoked a bunch of weed in the parking lot after dropping the wife at the front door and washed it down with two large popcorns. Otherwise it would have been a total loss. As much as I hate myself for typing it; it would have been better if he died at the end.
—John B., Rochester BS: We’re circling. Just sit tight. We’re landing in a second. Q: Is it just me or shouldn’t the actor that played the judge in A Few Good Men had a better career after that movie? He was really good … I am a little drunk …
—Clint W., Indianapolis BS: Yup, these are my readers. Let’s hit the conference-title picks. (Home teams in caps) Your New England red flags: no pass rush, no running game, too much offensive line upheaval, Vontae Davis shutting down Edelman, Luck catching fire, Vinatieri’s Possible Revenge, the unstoppable Sergio Brown/Ric Flair Rolex-Wearing Karma Train, the difficulty of pulling off two Kitchen Sink Games in a row, T.Y. Hilton running around and doing T.Y. Hilton things, and good luck (not Andrew) failing to carry over from last weekend. Remember, Baltimore caused three fumbles in traffic and the Patriots recovered all three (two because of luck, one because Shane Vereen’s knee was down for 0.2222 seconds). That may have been the last great Brady-Belichick win. It’s possible. Then again, the Colts can’t run the ball, either. They don’t have that scary/shifty/sneaky pass-catching back who routinely kills the 2014 Pats. They can’t cover tight ends. (I don’t need to say it.) Their gifted young QB puts the ball up for grabs two to three times per game (this time against an excellent Pats secondary). They’ve been positively pwned by the Pats during the Luck era (including two months ago). They may have just lucked out in the first two rounds — no A.J. Green or Jermaine Gresham in Round 1, then a crippled/aging/useless Manning and an impotent Broncos coaching staff in Round 2. Are we sure they aren’t a little happy to be there? Are we sure Gronk isn’t going to just throw them out of the club? Wouldn’t the Colts be the worst Super Bowl team in years? Here’s the trump card: I watched a lot of Luck these past two years. If you don’t pressure him, he morphs into a freaking assassin. Ask the Chiefs fans what happened last January. Ask the Bengals fans what happened two weeks ago. Unpressured Luck just keeps coming. The Pats won’t generate nearly enough pressure to bother him. That means Luck is gonna hang around and hang around and hang around and hang around and hang around … The Pick: Patriots 31, Colts 27 (Colts cover) First of all, that’s a disrespectful line. Green Bay can run and throw with the best of them. That’s too many points for an elite offense on the road. Vegas might as well fly “NOBODY BELIEVES IN YOU, GREEN BAY!” banners over CenturyLink Field. Second, Seattle’s admittedly splendid defense hasn’t played a good-to-great quarterback SINCE WEEK SIX. Seems relevant. Third, there’s a decent chance that we’re witnessing Rodgers’s “By the time this season is over, you’ll be wondering if I’m the best ever” season. It’s in play. If anyone can beat Seattle in Seattle, it’s him … but I think he falls juuuuuuuuuuuuuuust short. Seattle is due for one postseason scare, right? Besides, the Playoff Gambling Manifesto specifically warns us to “Beware of the Easy Same-Day Two-Team Tease.” Everyone and their degenerate brother is going to be teasing the Pats and Seahawks this weekend. Someone has to screw it up. This feels like a classic in the making. I’m giddy. Enjoy the weekend. The Pick: Seahawks 24, Packers 23 (Packers cover) Last Week: 3-1

184,NBA Bag: 10 Steps to Tanking Perfection," Editor’s note: Every Wednesday from now until the final day of the regular season (April 16), I am cranking out an all-NBA mailbag for the Triangle with a 5,000-word limit. As always, these are actual emails from actual readers. We’re tackling only one this week. Q: What are the odds that the Sixers finish their season on a 36-game losing streak? They’re at 15 already with 21 games to go. They put two actual NBA players on the floor each night, and things are so bad that I just thought about whether or not Byron Mullens is an actual NBA player. Is there a chance for L36? — Jack, Philly SG: The short answer … YES! You know how Lance Armstrong was the greatest cheater ever? How he blended his commendable charity work with state-of-the-art science and relentless lying to pull an ongoing Jedi mind trick on the American public? The 2013-14 Sixers have a chance to go down as the greatest NBA self-sabotagers ever. They haven’t been tanking games as much as obliterating any chance of winning them. And they’re doing it because the NBA gives every team the same loophole … If you want to throw away a season, depress your fans and disgrace the league for a 25 percent chance at the no. 1 pick and a 100 percent chance at a top-four pick … knock yourself out! The Sixers know they’re better off bottoming out in the grisliest way possible, so they’re owning it — they’ve done everything short of signing Kevin Hart and Allen Iverson’s mom to 10-day contracts. And those moves might be coming next week. Would anything shock you? Look at the self-sabotage blueprint that Philly’s new owners and GM Sam Hinkie have followed. Step 1: Trade your best player for future assets if you don’t feel like he can be the best player on a championship team. And that was a GREAT trade: Jrue Holiday for 2013’s no. 6 pick (Nerlens Noel) and New Orleans’s top-five protected first-rounder in 2014. Thanks to New Orleans’s struggles, Philly has an excellent chance of landing two top-10 picks in a deep 2014 draft; more important, they improved their own 2014 lottery chances by turning 82 games of Holiday into zero games of the already-injured Noel. A crucial part of self-sabotage: maiming yourself in the short term. You don’t want to sorta suck or kinda suck in the NBA. You want to suck all kinds of suck. (Important note: I loved that trade last summer and love it even more now that New Orleans is flopping in the West. Philly got somewhere between 130 and 200 cents on the dollar, depending on where that second pick lands, for someone who wasn’t a franchise player. I love Rajon Rondo, but if the Celtics got a Holiday-like offer for him, I’d be packing his bags and his leather Connect Four case for him.) Step 2: Don’t sign anyone who can help you, even if it means dipping under the salary-cap floor and going down as the cheapest NBA team ever. What’s the point of signing veterans like Jarrett Jack, Carl Landry, and Shaun Livingston in July just because you have the extra money? So they can tie up your cap, give you depth, make you a few wins better, take young players under their wing and maybe even teach them good work habits and professional behavior and all that overrated stuff? Screw that! Fill your bench with unproven young guys, failed draft picks and fringe bodies who make you say things like, “Wait, wasn’t that the dude on Jimmer’s BYU team who got suspended for getting laid?” and, “Is that the same Jarvis Varnado who was on Miami, or is this another Jarvis Varnado?” Step 3: Don’t get discouraged if you win early. Philly started out 5-4 for two reasons: Michael Carter-Williams was better than everyone expected, and its three holdovers (Thad Young, Evan Turner and Spencer Hawes) clicked in a surprisingly entertaining way. The Sixers handled it perfectly — never celebrating, never improving their roster and allowing Young-Turner-Hawes to be thrown in every conceivable trade rumor without ever saying, “We kinda like what we have here … change of plans!” By January, Carter-Williams was developing poor habits and learning to lose. Young was asking for a trade. And Hawes was mailing in games and carrying himself like the star of a hostage video. Well played, Philly. Step 4: If you can’t get fair value for your trade assets, trade them anyway. Before the deadline, Philly gave away Turner, Hawes and Lavoy Allen for three second-round picks, two expiring contracts they immediately bought out (Danny Granger and Earl Clark) and the immortal Henry Sims. People get carried away with second-round picks because they’re cost-effective assets if you nail them, but recent history says you have about a 10 percent chance of landing a rotation player from picks 31 to 40. (Since 2009, only Draymond Green, Kyle Singler, Chandler Parsons, Lance Stephenson, DeJuan Blair and MAYBE Nate Wolters came through.) After that, you’d have a better chance of hearing someone say the words, “I think what James Dolan is doing is really smart … ” By stockpiling second-rounders (five in all), Philly gave itself a puncher’s chance of landing someone who, someday, might be 80 percent as good as Spencer Hawes. Congratulations! But that’s a self-sabotage staple — you’re not throwing games, just making it impossible to win. Hawes and Turner needed to go. Step 5: If you can affect the playoff race just to be dicks, even better. Philly gift-wrapped Turner and Allen for Larry Legend for 10 cents on the dollar. Then, the Sixers bought out Granger to save $500K over keeping his sign-and-trade rights and hoping one of the league’s most respected veterans affected Carter-Williams in a positive way. Granger signed with the Clippers, meaning Philly potentially improved two of the league’s five best teams. (Note: I still think Granger has a salad fork sticking out of his back. We will see.) If someone made those two moves in your fantasy league, it would ignite a 125-email chain that included snarky insults, obscenities in all caps and semi-threats like, “Why don’t you drive over to my office right now and say that to my face?” When the Sixers do it? Totally fine. The NBA enables this behavior — there’s no trade committee, no “spirit of the league” rule, nothing. So, why not? Step 6: Trade for Byron Mullens. Thanks to a Latvian reader named Reinis for pointing this out: Byron Mullens is really the Olivia Pope of NBA self-sabotage. First, he has the experience — Mullens was the LVP of that unforgettably wretched 7-59 Bobcats team. When Charlotte dropped 23 straight to end its 2012 saboteurium, Lord Byron was giving them 27.2 horrendous minutes a night. The man knows what he’s doing. Nice guy? Absolutely. Could he be your 12th man? Sure! But if you’re riding him for big minutes, you’re riding a center who doesn’t protect the rim, rebound, defend or draw a double-team. You’re riding a sabermetic eyesore. You’re riding a 3-point specialist who can’t actually make 3-pointers.  Believe me, if you’re throwing away your season, you want Byron Mullens involved. Even with the Clips pushing to dump Mullens to open up a roster spot, Philly still traded a second-round pick to get him. He ended up fetching one fewer second-round pick than Spencer Hawes did! Has there ever been a better self-sabotage move? It was like the 1987 Lakers landing Mychal Thompson, only the exact opposite. Step 7: Come up with a fake injury for any good player and/or milk the recovery time of any existing injury. Here’s an interesting blueprint dilemma for Philly — only Carter-Williams can cost them a couple of losses (by playing too well), but the Sixers want MCW to win Rookie of the Year so that SOMETHING good comes out of this season. You know, because voters are dying to reward the best guy on a team that just lost 36 straight. Let’s send him a trophy and a car! Well done, my friend! The case for not shelving Williams with a bogus injury: He feeds into the self-sabotage as long as he’s forcing too many plays and cheating for steals over actually playing defense. Have you watched him lately? Yikes. That’s what happens when you enable an impressionable kid and allow him to chase the Rookie of the Year award over trying to win games. Anyway, you could make a strong case for keeping MCW out there. Hold this thought, we’re coming back to it in Step 10. Step 8: Give tons of minutes to young players who aren’t ready for them, and come up with as many doomed/goofy/ridiculous lineups as possible. Two sentences are your buddies here: “We think he has potential, and we want to see what we have here,” and, “We want to get a little more creative with our lineups and see if anything works.” Both are unequivocal lies. Whatever. If the Celtics landed Kevin Durant in 2007, do you think Boston fans would care seven years later that we played Allan Ray too much, or that Young Gerald Green had the green light to shoot from any spot on the floor, or that we played two and three point guards together at the same time? Again, we repeatedly played Delonte West, Rajon Rondo and Sebastian Telfair together at the same time. This actually happened. Within a few months, we had KG and Ray Allen and nobody cared. Sixers fans won’t care in six months, either. Assuming there are still Sixers fans. That reminds me … Step 9: Make a big deal about discounting next season’s tickets as a thank-you to your loyal season-ticket holders who paid full price for an 82-game season that you just threw away. Whoops — the Sixers went the opposite way! My bad. Before Allen Iverson’s jersey retirement ceremony last weekend, they enticed fans to buy 2014-15 season tickets with a thrilling offer: Get your tickets now and you can have your picture taken in front of Iverson’s no. 3 banner, then one of his bodyguards or flunkies Iverson will autograph that photo at a later date. They even called it “an exclusive opportunity.” You mean, more exclusive than paying full price for a D-League team with a genuine chance to finish zero for its last 36? Maybe they could have Tony Wroten autograph an “exclusive” picture of a disgustingly clogged toilet to commemorate their 29-point home shellacking to Cleveland last month. (The good news: The Sixers still have time to rectify this mistake. What about giving your loyal peeps a sorry-about-everything discount for 2015, you dumbasses? Or would that make too much sense?) Step 10: Weigh the benefits of self-sabotage against the long-term damage to your most valuable asset. Philly has a solid chance of passing Milwaukee for the Quadruple P (Ping-Pong Pole Position). The Sixers are only one loss behind, with no plans of ever winning again. But they shouldn’t ruin Carter-Williams to do it. In 1997, I watched M.L. Carr irrevocably alter Antoine Walker’s career with that same “Rookie of the Year on a Crap Team” carrot. As the Celtics threw away their last two months for Duncan ping-pong balls, they had Antoine playing out of position at center, hogging the ball, chasing his own numbers and learning horrendous habits. At the time, I was living in Boston and hitting most of those games because my dad steadfastly refused to go. Trust me: Antoine was only 20 years old, and he NEVER recovered from those two months. He learned all the wrong things. All of them. Well, the same thing is happening to Carter-Williams right now. He might be special, he might never get there … who knows? He’s a fantastic athlete with size, and someone who quickly adapted to the speed of the NBA game and belonged from day one. Could he have the career that we always wanted Shaun Livingston to have — just a slew of 22-9-12’s on a series of entertaining teams? Of course. But he’s also a genuinely dreadful outside shooter (see Kirk Goldsberry’s shot chart below), and he’s a little older than you think (at 22, he’s actually five months older than Kyrie Irving). We learned this the hard way with poor Ricky Rubio: Sometimes your outside shot is broken, and that’s just the way it is.  Regardless, here’s an undeniable fact: Carter-Williams played much better in 2013 (8-11 record, 17.8 PPG, 7.5 APG, 5.5 RPG, 3.1 SPG, 41% FG, 31% 3FG) than he has played in 2014 as the team has gone into self-sabotage mode (6-24 record, 16.5 PPG, 5.4 APG, 5.3 RPG, 1.3 SPG, 38% FG, 24% 3FG). That’s a problem. They’re better off punting on Rookie of the Year, coming up with a bogus injury and keeping him away from the team’s festering stink. There are no good lessons from intentionally getting your asses kicked every night. Last night, the Sixers lost by 33 in Oklahoma City as Russell Westbrook finished with a triple-double in 20 minutes. Twenty minutes! Um, how is that helping Carter-Williams? Philly’s easiest remaining games: Utah, @Knicks, Sacramento, Knicks, Detroit, @Atlanta, @Boston, Boston, Game 82 at Miami (against Miami’s second string). You’re damned right 0-36 is in play. Meanwhile, Milwaukee, Utah and Orlando are their self-sabotage partners, although they haven’t been quite as blatant (ironically, the bumbling Bucks actually TRIED to be good). Utah, Sacramento, Boston and the Lakers will start to smell a little gamey soon. The disappointing Pelicans want to keep that top-five-protected pick, which means (a) get ready for the bogus Anthony Davis injury soon, and (b) we might be getting a lot of Austin Rivers down the stretch. Maybe even 40 minutes a night. We might have to stick paramedics near Haralabob Voulgaris at all times. (What a shame that we can’t watch Rivers and Mullens on the same team running pick-and-rolls.) And don’t sleep on Atlanta throwing its season away (already happening) or Denver doing the same (about to happen). Ladies and gentlemen, that’s our biggest Tankapalooza field ever: one-third of the league! Does Adam Silver care? Does he want to repair this? I’ve already suggested fixes in 2007 (the Entertaining As Hell Tournament), 2009 (in an exchange with Gladwell on how to fix the NBA draft) and 2011 (tweak on the same tournament idea). Grantland’s Zach Lowe wrote about Mike Zarren’s concept of a lottery wheel three months ago. I mean, if the NBA has a relocation committee and a media rights committee, wouldn’t it make sense to create a For the Good of the Game committee? We have too many teams (that’s never changing), a season that’s too long (that could easily be fixed) and far too much incentive for non-contenders to intentionally fail (that can DEFINITELY be fixed). We also don’t have any penalties in place — not even something as simple as, “If you lose 90 percent of your games for any 35-game stretch during a season, your season-ticket holders receive a 30 percent discount for the following season.” Would we see as much self-sabotage if the owners’ wallets were involved? Somehow I doubt it. Two weeks ago, I wondered about the best way for an NBA general manager to make sure he stays employed for four to five years. “The answer: Blow everything up, bottom out, build around young players/cap space/lottery picks, make a bunch of first-round picks, and sell the ‘illusion of hope’ to your fans. I’d like to see people in other professions try this.” As a San Francisco reader named Aziz pointed out, I inadvertently “described the private equity business model. Take over a bloated company, load it up with debt, dump assets, cut research & development, and basically guarantee the company can’t do anything innovative for a decade. Once the debt is paid off, you have a company with nice free cash flow (‘cap space’). And guess what? Many NBA teams are now owned by private equity or venture capital investors, including some of our most unapologetic tankers.” One of them? Philly’s Josh Harris. Hmmmmmm. Could there be a correlation? And why would the NBA want any correlation? The league’s creative paralysis from 2008 through 2013 had a built-in excuse: David Stern stayed five years too long. He only allowed innovation that involved the words “digital” or “international.” He stopped taking chances, stopped thinking outside the box, stopped trying to grow the game domestically. He bristled anytime someone questioned him, held on to petty grudges, bullied people behind the scenes and protected the wrong people. Stern executed his own kind of blueprint: the Here’s What Happens When You Stay Too Long blueprint. Even his “retirement” lasted an absurdly long time: nearly 18 months in all, as Stern chased and conquered Pete Rozelle’s meaningless “longest tenure by a commissioner” record. He should have exited last June — after an incredible Finals and a bizarrely entertaining draft in Brooklyn — in what could have been something of a victory lap. Instead, he hung around for eight more awkward months. Everyone assumed that Stern would stay as the league’s unofficial international ambassador, feasting on a cushy gig that allowed him to traipse around the world (India, China, Australia — you name it), while pushing the sport abroad. That job never materialized. The dirty secret of Stern’s last 18 months was that, as much as the 30 owners respected him, they also believed it was time for him to leave. And somehow, the smartest guy in the room was the last guy who realized it. Adam Silver’s first month in charge was distinguished mostly by how hastily Silver distanced himself from his old mentor. Many of Stern’s administrative cronies had already been forced out, and Stern’s surprising absence from All-Star Weekend in New Orleans wasn’t exactly random. A new generation has emerged behind the scenes, with Silver flanked by new assistant commish Mark Tatum (a beloved hire), NBA Entertainment honcho Danny Meiseles, merchandising guru Sal LaRocca, global media head Bill Koenig, and Adam’s right-hand man, Jarad Franzreb, among others. The current group of owners with the most influence — ranging from the old guard (Peter Holt and the Reinsdorfs) to the newer old guard (Stan Kroenke, James Dolan, Wyc Grousbeck, Mark Cuban, Ted Leonsis) to the new guys (Vivek Ranadive, Joe Lacob) — all believe in Silver and have his back, both publicly and privately. They like the guy. That’s not a sentence you heard about David Stern very often. Truth be told, Stern would have stayed in office even longer if some of those owners hadn’t gently nudged him out. With a monster television deal coming, digital content booming and live events becoming the most valuable media rights property — especially with multiple 24-hour sports networks and local cable superstations that need hundreds of hours of airtime to fill — the league itself has never been stronger. It didn’t just win the last collective bargaining agreement; it destroyed the players and checkmated a fractured union. Do you realize that Brian McCann signed for more guaranteed money this winter than LeBron’s last contract? It’s no accident that, other than maybe Milwaukee, ZERO professional basketball teams are for sale. Seattle has two billionaires willing to double the sticker price for a handful of the 30 teams; nobody is biting. Throw in LeBron and Durant — the best rivalry, potentially, since Bird and Magic — and all the other star-studded contenders, and it’s an amazing time to run a basketball league. Silver and his owners believe that there’s a real window here — thanks to the concussion crisis in football and the execrable length of baseball games — for the NBA to seize the reins and become America’s new pastime. There’s a reason the new commish mentioned this publicly more than once. His owners want to hear a little less about “growing the sport abroad” and a little more about “building the sport domestically.” Other than the way he treated people and carried himself, that was their single biggest issue with Stern. And that’s why this tanking bullshit matters. When 36 percent of your league is willfully throwing away the last five weeks of an 82-game season, you’re doing something wrong. Stern stuck his head in the sand. He pretended self-sabotage wasn’t a recurring danger, just like he pretended the broken officiating system was fine … and the always-disappointing All-Star Saturday was fine … and the annoying 2-3-2 Finals format was fine … and the stunning lack of minority league executives at every CBA bargaining table was fine … and the embarrassing Chris Paul trade veto was fine … and The Decision was fine … and the Maloofs destroying basketball in Sacramento to the point that the fans had to revolt was fine … and Clay Bennett extorting Seattle for a new arena and ultimately hijacking the team was fine … and the league owning the New Orleans franchise as it landed the no. 1 overall pick was fine … and starting off Silver’s commissioner transition by hovering over him for an extra eight months was fine. I don’t think Adam Silver wants to stick his head in the sand. I really don’t. But conquering the self-sabotage corner is a good place for him to start. This isn’t tanking. Nobody is throwing games. They’re just shitting on them. And they’re doing it because it’s the smartest thing to do. Don’t pretend this is fine. It’s not.",2014-03-05T14:24:28+00:00,NBA,Simmons
185,Welcome to the Super Bag,"You know what really sucks? This is an especially good Super Bowl matchup. The big-picture stakes: Either the Seahawks will become the first back-to-back champs in 10 years or the Patriots will win their fourth Super Bowl and vault their coach and quarterback to another level historically. The small-picture stakes: No Super Bowl matchup has ever been tighter. We started out with Seattle favored by 2.5 points; now, New England is favored by one. Of course, we spent the last two weeks talking about cheating and footballs and PSI. Physics professors got involved. Multiple media members embarrassed themselves, breathlessly reported bad info or came off like complete hypocrites, although I guess that’s nothing new. There was one 24-hour span last week, right after Belichick seemingly threw Brady under the bus and a rattled Brady rambled in front of reporters for about 15 minutes too long, when it seemed like the Belichick-Brady dynasty was actually imploding. The weekend rolled around, the moment passed, the entire Patriots team shifted into F.U. mode, and that was that. Now it’s the Friday before the Super Bowl … and we don’t really know much more than we knew 12 days ago. We know for sure that Brady likes his footballs inflated to the lowest legal PSI (12.5). We know that Brady’s 12 footballs were “approved” about two hours before the Colts game, that referee Walt Anderson never wrote the PSI levels of those balls down, and that Anderson may have touched each football like he was feeling melons at a farmers market. That one feels good … I like that one … that one’s fine … We know that a “person of interest” (a Patriots employee) took the first batch of approved footballs for a 90-second bathroom trip that was found on video within a week … you know, by the same league that literally went out of its way for nearly seven months NOT to find a casino elevator video of a Ravens star punching his fiancée in the face. We know that it takes about 90 seconds to either take a piss and wash your hands or deflate 11 footballs by just a little. More on the Super Bowl Barnwell’s Super Bowl Breakdown Belichick: The Great Defender Giving Vince Wilfork His Due Marshawn Lynch and the Media Cousin Sal’s SB Prop Bets Beware the Visor: Kam Chancellor Among the Lurchers at Media Day Pats and Seahawks Weaknesses NFL Defense Championship Belt Matthew Slater: Mr. Special Teams Story of the First Tackle How Belichick Rules the Draft ‘You Mad, Bro?’ Revisited Pierce on the Deflatriots Farce The Pats’ Homegrown Linebackers More on the Super Bowl We know they played the Colts game in 50-degree weather, in a driving downpour, and we know that a recent New York Times article highlighted a physics expert proving that a semi-dramatic weather change would absolutely alter PSI from “legal” to “not quite legal.” We know game officials touched the footballs before and after EVERY first-half play. We know they changed to 12 new footballs at halftime, and after they did, the Patriots scored 28 points and sent the Colts packing. And we know that Bill Belichick and Bob Kraft did their own internal investigations, then put their credibility on the line — in separate press conferences — by insisting the Patriots did nothing wrong and essentially daring the NFL to come after them. So unless an incriminating email/text message/phone conversation is unearthed, or unless a cheating Patriots employee sells his story for big bucks, we’ll never know what actually happened. That’s my prediction: eternal ambiguity. We’ll never know. Just like we’ll never know whether JFK was really killed by a lone gunman, we’ll never know if David Stern suspended Michael Jordan for gambling, and we’ll never know how they screwed up Taken 3. And for a few days, Patriots fans didn’t totally know what to do. After all, nobody sets out to root for America’s accepted villain, right? Who wants to root for the real-life Cobra Kai? Who wants to come to grips with the fact that, for an entire generation of football fans under 30, Belichick’s Patriots are the modern version of Al Davis’s “Just Win Baby” Raiders? It takes a few days to adjust … and then it’s fine. You get defensive. You turn into a massive homer. You embrace that us-against-the-world mentality. Over these last 12 days, I heard from more buddies and family members and long-lost friends than for any Patriots Super Bowl since the one in 2002 — people either poking fun at me for supporting “cheaters” or playing the “We’re getting railroaded, WE ARE WINNING AND EVERYONE CAN F OFF” card. Two extremes. No in-between. And I tried not to let that affect this year’s Super Bag. I really did. But I can’t say that I totally succeeded. As always, these are actual emails from actual readers. Q: As someone that has read your column religiously for over 10 years now but hates the Patriots (I am a Raiders fan), I’m dying to hear you answer the following questions: 1. What is your honest take of the Deflategate situation? 2. If the NFL had Adam Silver as commissioner, how would he respond? 3. How do you think Goodell will respond, given his egregious missteps recently?
—Bill, Littleton BS: Let’s answer these questions in reverse order. First, Goodell has screwed up just about every “investigation” he’s done — profoundly, unbelievably, and historically — which means we’d have a better chance with Ballghazi if Scooby and Shaggy were involved. So, if Goodell handles this in typically Goodellian fashion, he’ll drag his feet after the “incident” (already happened), say nothing interesting during his Super Bowl press conference other than generic nonsense (it just happened — and yes, he got skewered by ESPN’s Arizona crew for 30 solid minutes afterward), go into hiding for the next two to three weeks (bank on that, too), then belatedly make a disastrous decision in late February that will get annihilated by the media and football fans. And that will be followed by someone protesting (probably the Colts, who definitely lost by 38 points because the footballs were 7 percent lighter than usual) and then a second investigation to make sure that Goodell made the right decision, followed by an “independent” arbiter redoing that decision and everyone remaining unhappy afterward. That’s how he handles things. Basically, I’m predicting that Roger Goodell pulls a Goodell. If Adam Silver were in charge, he would have said before media day, “It will take me two weeks to figure out what happened, but if we find out that the Patriots cheated, then I’m taking their first-round pick and fining them $1 million. And I might also suspend people. I am taking this VERY seriously. Just, everyone, please be careful — I don’t want our players and coaches accused of cheating without any actual evidence. It’s wrong.” Also, there wouldn’t have been multiple leaks per week to NFL reporters whom the league is trying to butter up again after double-crossing them last summer with Rice scandal info (you know who you are). Silver’s administration doesn’t leak stuff. My honest, I-swear-on-my-new-puppy’s-life-that-I-feel-this-way take: Brady likes throwing footballs that aren’t too tight, so they prepare them as legally-not-too-tight as possible, and maybe they were smart enough to know that inclement weather would make those footballs even a little less tight. This explanation has ALWAYS made the most sense. If any chicanery happened, here’s your best possibility: NFL referees rarely (if ever) measure the balls (instead doing the farmers market–melons routine), so the Patriots inflated them lower than the limit and hoped Anderson wouldn’t notice. If he noticed, then they would have inflated them more, but he never noticed. It’s just not that interesting, and since we live in a Conspiracy-Loving Era — believe me, nobody loves conspiracies more than I do — it’s more entertaining to imagine Sully the Ball Boy sneaking into a bathroom and deflating footballs because Brady and Belichick gave him a suitcase of cash and a free Lexus. Regardless, America wouldn’t have cared about this story nearly as much if any other NFL team were involved. Football teams cheat all the time. (Read this admittedly homerrific breakdown.) Football teams constantly search for edges. (Why does just about every head coach and offensive coordinator STILL cover their faces when calling a play? You think they’re trying to hide a pimple from HD cameras?) The post-Spygate Patriots are like a cheating spouse who got caught, repaired his/her marriage, never got caught again … but anytime anything seems suspicious after that, the other spouse just freaks out and assumes the worst. That’s why this story kept going for two solid weeks. Q: The section of the Super Bowl mailbag where Simmons makes every tired excuse and rationalization for his Pats cheating again will begin in 5…4…3…2…1…
—Derek, Mission, KS BS: That already happened. You just missed it. You were probably in the bathroom for 90 seconds.  Q: Do you realize your Patriots can trump the “Nobody believes in us!” card and be the first “Hey, nobody believes us!” team?
—Brett S., Gilberts, IL BS: I couldn’t be prouder. I always wanted to root for an NFL team that behaves like Ben Affleck during the first 75 minutes of Gone Girl. It’s a dream come true. Q: For unfounded media speculation, Deflategate is on par with the JFK assasination. We already have 50 conspiracy theories and we’re only missing forensic scientists. After a big FU-to-the-world-victory over Seattle, do you think we’ll see Zapruder-like cell phone footage of Belichick and Brady huddling around 12 footballs that we’ll dissect five million times. Back and to the left! Will Oliver Stone’s last movie be “Deflategate?”
—Mike D., North Brunswick, NJ BS: Mike D. just stumbled into my worst fear after a Patriots win (if they win) — waking up next week on West Coast time (6:30 a.m. range, after the East Coast workday already started), checking my cell phone and just seeing a string of emails with “TMZ” in the subject heading. Actually, that’s my worst fear every morning, anyway. (Wait, did I just give my friends a guaranteed way to mess with me in the morning whenever they want? Dammit! DELETE! DELETE!) Q: Face it, the Patriots are cheaters. What makes it so despicable is that it is so unnecessary. I used to work for Costco and one day store security busted a well dressed woman with a Hillsborough address (that’s Northern California Beverly Hills) carrying a large Louis Vuitton purse. She had put a pack of Duracell batteries in it. That’s your Patriots.
—Otis, San Francisco BS: You’re right. Messing around slightly with footballs to crush a mediocre Colts team that you would have crushed anyway, or illegally taping Eric Mangini’s sideline signals when he’s Eric Freaking Mangini … I mean, that IS like a rich lady shoplifting a pack of Duracells. Totally unnecessary. That’s why I think they didn’t do it twice. Once, yes. Twice, no. Q: Face it Simmons, there’s a gigantic turd in the Pats dynasty punch bowl that can never be fished out. 
—Tarzan, Los Angeles BS: (Still hoping it’s a Baby Ruth bar.) Q: How does it feel knowing your Patriots are bigger villains than the Yankees and Lakers?
—Dan, New York BS: That’s great company! Forty-three combined world championships! Let’s ask Bills fans: Would you rather be compared to the Vikings and Browns … or the Patriots, Yankees and Lakers? YEAH, I THOUGHT SO!!!!! It’s us against the world, baby!  Q: As a degenerate gambler, what are the odds the Pats say “FU” to everyone and take the field next Sunday to “Sympathy For The Devil”?
—Bill S., Ludington, MI BS: OK, maybe it’s not always that much fun rooting for the real-life nWo. Q: Hey Simmons — what is Belichick’s favorite Operetta? Give up? Die Fledermaus.
—Paul, Montclair, NJ BS: Congrats to Paul for insulting my team (I’m assuming) and my intelligence (because I have no idea what Die Fledermaus was/is). Couldn’t you have just gone with a Tom Cruise movie? By the way, that’s how many emails I got making fun of the Patriots — people even used operetta putdowns. What an unforgettable 12 days. Q: Before the second Pats-Giants Super Bowl, I emailed you asking what Madonna halftime song would be most appropriate for the Patriots narrative, similar to U2’s “Beautiful Day” in 2001 and Tom Petty’s “Free Falling” in 2007. Your answer, “Like A Prayer,” became a great description of the game-winning Hail Mary that Gronkowski almost caught. (Sadly, that prayer was not answered.) So what Katy Perry halftime song will become New England’s musical parallel this time around?
—Dave B., San Francisco BS: Great question. And sadly, I have a 9-and-a-half-year-old daughter and knew the answer almost immediately. My best-case-scenario Katy song: “Roar.” Check out these lyrics: I used to bite my tongue and hold my breath
Scared to rock the boat and make a mess So I sat quietly, agreed politely
I guess that I forgot I had a choice (THAT WAS THE PATS DURING THE FIRST FIVE DAYS OF DEFLATEGATE.) I let you push me past the breaking point
I stood for nothing, so I fell for everything (YEAH, NFL, WE LET YOU PUSH US PAST THE BREAKING POINT!) You held me down, but I got up (HEY!)
Already brushing off the dust You hear my voice, you hear that sound
Like thunder gonna shake the ground (THAT’S THE SECOND BELICHICK PRESS CONFERENCE.) You held me down, but I got up (HEY!)
Get ready ’cause I’ve had enough
I see it all, I see it now (TRANSLATION: WE’RE UP 13-3 AT HALFTIME!) I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter, dancing through the fire
’Cause I am a champion and you’re gonna hear me roar
Louder, louder than a lion
’Cause I am a champion and you’re gonna hear me roar
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
You’re gonna hear me roar (“ROAR” RHYMES WITH FOUR, AS IN … FOUR SUPER BOWLS!) So what’s the worst-case-scenario Katy song? That would be “Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.),” a song about girls who broke the partying rules on the previous Friday night and … yup … decided to break the rules again. Oh, and it includes this part: Last Friday night
Yeah I think we broke the law
Always say we’re gonna stop
Op-oh-oh
This Friday night
Do it all again
This Friday night
Do it all again (Let’s just move on. Quickly.) Q: You mentioned on a podcast that Manning can’t play whole seasons anymore. Why wouldn’t Manning start pulling a Roger Clemens and take the first 2 regular season months off, then be fresh for the second half?  
—Randy, South Bend, IN BS: I think we need to be a little more careful with the phrase “Pulling a Clemens.”  Q: Please preempt the obligatory Green Bay fans’ stomach punch loss emails with this: “HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! TAKE THAT YOU DICKS. NOW YOU KNOW HOW IT FEELS. Sorry about your loss…but not really! Sincerely, Minnesota Vikings fans.”
—Zimtown, Chanhassen, MN BS: You got it, Vikings fans. It’s the least I could do. Q: The worst part about DEFLATEGATE is that Packers fans were deprived of Mike McCarthy’s well earned public roasting. He is like a guy who rents a Lamborgini in Germany, gets on the Autoban, then refuses to go over 75 because he is afraid there is a “secret speed limit” for Americans. YOU ARE ON THE AUTOBAN. DRIVE 175 FOR THE LOVE OF GOD.
—Nick, Tucson BS: Biggest winners from the past 12 days: the Colts (total stink bomb, awful coaching, couldn’t have played worse, lost by 38, quit as the game went on, only everyone forgot about them within eight hours); McCarthy (coached the NFC title game with both hands wrapped around his own neck); all the Packers who screwed that game up (Morgan Burnett’s slide, Dom Capers going into the prevent on third-and-19 and generally rolling over during those last three TD drives, Brandon Bostick, Green Bay’s special teams coach for being blindsided by a fake field goal attempt when they were up 16 with almost 20 minutes to go); Roger Goodell; Roger Goodell a second time; and everyone who cleared Russell Wilson to come back after Clay Matthews destroyed him (more on this in a second). But McCarthy was THE biggest winner. We should have spent that whole week after the title games wondering if he had just presided over one of the three biggest chokes in NFL history (and how culpable he was). Instead, just Packers fans were doing that. Q: I’m 54 and a Packers fan since birth. Nothing has or ever will top the collapse in Seattle. They scored six points off five turnovers. This was football’s version of The Mountain vs. The Viper in Game of Thrones
—Bob B., La Crosse Q: If either one of LITERALLY two plays work out differently, the Packers go to the Super Bowl and everyone realizes Rodgers is maybe the best QB of all time. I can’t even muster up going crazy; I just feel empty. I’m drinking whatever gets passed to me, and I’m five minutes away from taking a walk to smoke anything that ends up in a 10 foot radius. Please help me out here. Signed, For the Love of God, I’m Too Devastated to Cry.
—Lucas, Rochester Q: Should there be a new “Level of Losing” created for Green Bay’s loss to the Seahawks?
—Matt, Richmond, VA BS: Before we answer that question, I made a crucial fix to Level 1 of that column (“That Game”) after the Vikings blew the NFC title game in January 2010: Game 6 (of the 1986 World Series) might have been the most powerful Level 1 example, but it wasn’t the only example. The Bartman Game, Byner Fumble, Pedro/Grady Game, Gary Anderson Game, No Goal Game, Darrin Nelson Game and Jose Mesa Game all were Guillotine/Stomach Punch combos for effed-up franchises. (That’s another good indicator, by the way — being able to identify the loss with a short but recognizable phrase.) Limiting Level 1 to the Red Sox was purely an only-child, everything-revolves-around-me decision. I mean, Steve Bartman had to leave the country. That wasn’t a Level 1 defeat? I made a mistake. Really, the equation should look like this: (Guillotine + Stomach Punch) x (already tortured history) x (significance of the game itself) x (catchy moniker) = Level 1. So that answers our first question: That Packers loss can’t be Level 1–worthy because there wasn’t a tortured history in play. They’ve won a Super Bowl within the past 20 years and the Super Bowl trophy is called the Lombardi Trophy. And yet, that unbelievable Packers collapse and San Antonio’s unbelievable collapse in Game 6 of the 2013 NBA Finals were waaaaaaay worse than Stomach Punch games — those were guaranteed victories that flipped only because of a bizarre chain of events. Those collapses required multiple mistakes, multiple great plays by the other team, at least one bad break, at least one exceptionally lucky play, and at least one high degree-of-difficulty play. If anything in that chain changes — even one thing — then the original team still wins. Also, you knew during the unbelievable comeback that something HAUNTINGLY INSANE might be happening. That, too. So I vote for a new Level 2: “The Box.” See, the last few minutes of Se7en also featured bad coaching decisions; terrific execution by the seemingly losing team (Spacey); a chain of events that could have fallen apart had one thing gone differently; and, ultimately, a haunting defeat. A quick recap … Pitt and Freeman are delighted that they finally caught serial killer Spacey, only now they’re driving him to that undisclosed location in the middle of nowhere, and they know something is wrong, but they can’t put their finger on it, and they get there, and they’re just waiting there, and it’s more and more nerve-wracking, and maybe they shouldn’t have gone there in the first place, and then some car drives up to deliver a package, and everyone freaks out, only it’s just a package, but then they realize it’s more than a package, and now they can’t shake the terrible feeling that there’s something IN the package, only they’re afraid to open it, only Freeman can’t resist opening it, and then Pitt starts screaming “What’s in the box?” while deep down knowing that there’s something truly disturbing in the box. And everything leads to Pitt screaming …  That’s Level 2. The Box. Q: The invasion of Normandy was essentially the world’s 4th and goal. Without Eisenhower’s leadership, we don’t take that beach. Green Bay needed Eisenhower in Seattle.
—Adam, Syracuse BS: Instead, they had Mike McCarthy. Uh-oh, I feel a run of McCarthy emails coming on. You better hold on to something. Q: I think Mike McCarthy needs a terrible nickname to let everyone clearly know what an unfathomable sissy he is. What about the exact opposite of Riverboat Ron? Since McCarthy would only gamble if a bingo hall give him free bingo on his birthday, he’s Free Birthday Bingo Mike. I’m still in denial that we lost. I cannot even think about it. But I do know there is a special place in hell for my one Bears fan friend who sent me taunting text messages afterwards. If she got cancer of the everything right now, I’d feel it was fair.
—Conor, Austin Q: After 3 days, I finally named that game: SCARED SHITLESS IN SEATTLE! Mike McCarthy is like a 90 year old grandma in the fast lane of the highway going 20 MPH under the speed limit. Hands clenched tight in the 10 and 2 position while people are passing him in the right lane flipping him off and honking their horns. The Packers had four 4th and 1’s. You know how many Coach Scared Shitless went for? Zero. Not a DAMN 1.  Step on the gas Grandma!
—Kevin, Appleton, WI BS: Yep, we had a two-way tie in this month’s “Come Up With the Meanest Nickname Possible For Mike McCarthy Contest.” I say you’re both winners — just call the game “Scared Shitless in Seattle” and nickname your coach Free Birthday Bingo Mike. Everyone wins. Buy each other these Brandon Bostick T-shirts and go celebrate.1 Q: Can we stop pretending that Mike McCarthy isn’t just Andy Reid with a Super Bowl win?
—Jamie, Grand Rapids, MI BS: I stopped pretending a long time ago. Here’s Andy telling a story for Mike that definitely ends with the punch line, “Come on, like I WASN’T going to settle for a field goal there???”  Q: Lions lose in gut wrenching fashion to Cowboys.
Cowboys lose in gut wrenching fashion to Packers.
Packers lose in gut wrenching fashion to Seahawks.
Seahawks lose in gut wrenching fashion to Pats.
—Chris, Austin Q: Has Detroit’s franchise stink been spiritually transferred to the survivor ala Azazel from the movie Fallen? Beware Seattle.
—Ryan, San Diego, CA BS: Somebody just won $200 on 45-to-1 odds that Fallen would be the only Denzel movie referenced in the 2015 Super Bag. It’s like betting on the safety. Q: Diehard Pats fan living in NYC. The northeast is getting slammed with snow right now and I’ve had a little too much much Fireball. But I just watched Bobby Kraft’s surprise press conference for like the 20th time and I am so pumped for this week! He basically just said “prove it”, flopped his balls on Roger Goodell’s desk, and dropped the mic. It was amazing. Besides the 2008 Super Bowl, this has to be the biggest game in Patriots history!?! I’ve hit the boiling point, I don’t care anymore, the Patriots are the heel of this generation. Embrace it, everyone else can go screw themselves! Go Pats!!!!!!!!!
—Sean, Astoria, NY BS: That easily could have been signed, “Every Patriots Fan, Everywhere.” Q: Tonight the Nightly News OPENED with five minutes on the Patriot deflategate news conferences. The news on the Saudi king death and the Yemen government falling came after it. It’s official, hating the Patriots is more important then governments and kings. Go Pats!!!
—Joe C, Waltham, MA Q: It’s 230am and I am still jacked up from Belicheck’s presser. He debunked spygate and deflategate in one press conference and subsequently fired up New England. That “80,000 people” comment on the misbranding of spygate had seven years of spite and venom attached to it. All time great Belicheck moment.. You can’t really think this is the end for Tom and Bill, it can’t be. We’re in FU Mode!
—Smitty, Mass BS: I just wish a controversial movie had come out over Christmas that had two characters repeatedly saying, “Hate us cuz they ain’t us,” that I could embed. Wait, what?  Q: What absurd but incredibly clever new trick Belichick is going to pull off on Sunday? Everyone knows all about his “Ineligible Vereen” formations and Edelman pass plays now. What do you think he will try?
—Jordan, New York BS: First of all, thanks for leaving out “deflating footballs.” I really appreciate it. Second, I’m predicting a goofy four–tight end alignment with Gronk, Tim Wright, Michael Hoomamamoomo (my Dad’s pronunciation for New England’s third-string tight end) and tackle-eligible Nate Solder on a third-and-1 play with no right tackle and two of those four guys ineligible and all hell breaking loose followed by Collinsworth nearly having an on-air orgasm when the play goes for 18 yards. Q: I’ve been a loyal reader since the Fall of ’98 when I was a freshman in high school. I thought I’d never see the day when you lost your fastball. Last mailbag, you left Jennifer Love Hewitt off the Mount Rushmore of Women Other Women Irrationally Hate. Bad form Simmons. That missed opportunity was my “Larry Bird wearing a 25-pound back brace” moment. Appreciative for all the memories, but sad at the realization that it all might be coming to an end… all in the same moment.
—Schimri, Philadelphia BS: Come on! I mistakenly assumed that J-Love wasn’t relevant enough anymore. It’s been 10 years since Jack from Cleveland encouraged me to tell my wife that I thought Jennifer Love Hewitt was attractive and that I enjoyed her acting, and when I did, “she reacted like George Brett in the Pine Tar Game.” It’s been three years since Ken in Brighton asked me who the anti-Hewitt was — a.k.a. the female celebrity whom women will irrationally defend if you disparage her in any way. My answer? Khloe Kardashian! That’s right, once upon a time, there was a likable Kardashian! Oh, and J-Love last headlined a show on the Lifetime Channel. Her decade-long run is over — there’s just no way she inspires the same cattiness anymore. (Thinking.) Just to be sure, lemme show this photo of J-Love to the Sports Gal and tell her that J-Love looks “super-hot for a pregnant lady.” (Hold on.) Yup, didn’t faze her. Slight frown followed by, “What’s she doing now?” By the way, I went to the Producers Guild Awards last weekend and realized that Jennifer Lawrence is the new anti-Hewitt (and probably has been for a while). She gave a speech introducing Lionsgate CEO John Feltheimer, winner of the Milestone Award, and was so funny/adorable/charming/endearing that, by the end of it, everyone in the room would have made out with her except for Sharon Stone (who looked like she was plotting ways to steal J-Law’s hemoglobin and inject it right into her veins). Hey, speaking of things that can cause you to get divorced … Q: Thanks to three more “early” London games next season, you’ll be able to watch four full NFL games in one day starting at 6:30 am, 10 am, 1:30 pm and 5 pm your time. My question: have divorce lawyers started recruiting you, like how agents recruit big time college athletes about to enter the draft?
—Mark F., Sterling Heights BS: Absolutely. They’ve been reaching out. And don’t forget — the NFL might expand to 14 playoff teams, which means six playoff games in 36 hours in Round 1. There’s a good chance that Goodell is trying to cause a national divorce epidemic to throw everyone off his decomposing commissioner’s scent. You can’t blame him. Q: How scared are you that Russell Wilson seemingly claimed Eli’s Lucky Up-The-Ass Horseshoe and became the luckiest QB alive? I mean, you can totally see him somehow escaping a sure sack and throwing a Hail Mary that bounces off three defenders before getting wedged into a receiver’s facemask for the Super Bowl winning score, right?
—Evan, Tucson, AZ BS: This might give Grantland’s Bill Barnwell and Ben Lindbergh dueling heart attacks, and it might even cause both of Jonah Keri’s temples to explode, but I am typing it anyway: I believe that luck, as weird as this sounds, is a skill. Whenever I play golf with my buddy Ness, anytime he hooks or slices a drive, it bounces off a tree and lands in a favorable spot. We joke about it every time — I always say that God feels bad because Ness has three young daughters who will torture him through their teens and then eventually make him pay for three weddings, so He ordered all of Ness’s lousy drives to ricochet toward the fairway. We don’t even make the joke anymore when it happens; we just say, “Three daughters!” But that’s a skill. It’s just part of his golf game. He has to get credit for it. Same thing for Wilson and Eli. They have exhibited the skill, repeatedly, to get super-lucky in big games. It’s no different from Ness’s drives bouncing toward the fairway or my father-in-law winning every time on cheap slot machines. (Also true.) I believe in regression to the mean, and I believe in luck evening out over time, and I believe in repeating myself to make sentences longer. Wilson scares me because of his legs, because he gets a little better when it matters, and because he’s lucky. I don’t like rooting against lucky people. Q: You are a coward if your end of the column footnote doesn’t change to “I finished 58-0 from week 4 to week 7. Also, neither Tom Brady nor Bill Belichick had anything to do with deflating 11 out of 12 footballs in the AFC Championship Game.”
—Joshua, Raleigh BS: You’ll have to wait until the end. Q: I’m a member of the military currently overseas working in my job as a Physician Assistant. Without A DOUBT, Russell Wilson suffered a concussion on the block from Clay Mathews. It’s not even a question in my mind as to whether a concussion occurred, but more of a question of how bad was it. You don’t get hit in the face while looking the other direction, a knee-buckling blow, by a norse god like Mathews and have any other result. That’s why you saw such a shaky Wilson for most the game. Like a fighter dazed by a haymaker, it took him a while to shake off the effects — we barely saw him do anything but hand off, or any read-option with Wilson keeping it till the very end. This also explains his fourth quarter 90+ point burst in QBR once he finally recovered. While I’m not specifically an expert in the field of traumatic brain injury, it’s kind of my job to know a thing or two.
—Jason, “Undisclosed Location” BS: Check out this Vine and tell me Jason is wrong. And check out Seattle’s drives from that point on. First of all, on Wilson’s next drive after that hit, Seattle ran the ball six straight times before the drive eventually ended in Wilson’s awful end zone pick. We didn’t see throwing/scrambling Wilson again for another two quarters — almost two hours after that Matthews hit — and then he started looking a little bit like Wilson again from the 10-minutes-left mark on. Put it this way: There’s just as much circumstantial evidence that the Seahawks hid Wilson’s concussion (or Wilson hid it from them) as there is that Brady and/or Belichick knew those balls were deflated. SO THERE! Q: Answer honestly. You and Bill Belichick are going to sit down and play a game of monopoly. How comfortable are you with Belichick being the banker?
—Keith, Massapequa Park, NY BS: I swear on my new puppy’s life a second time that this happened — as I was trying to “honestly” answer this question, the space bar jammed on my laptop and I had to pry it back up with a steak knife. I don’t know what this means.2 Q: Last year, we dubbed the Super Bowl the ‘Doobie Brothers Bowl’ honoring two teams from two states that legalized weed. We need to come up with a nickname for this year’s game that pits a Front Running-Smack Talking-Formerly Sad Sack Fan Base Turned Loud Mouths-with a Two Faced Quarterback Who Sweettalks the Media but Admits to Bullying VERSUS a Ball Deflating, Practice Filming, Won Everything in the Mid 2000s Fan Base and Hasn’t Shut Up Since, Cat Dressed Tight End (not a euphemism)  with the Ugg Wearing Douchebag Quarterback. Congratulations Roger Goodell. Everyone hates this game. So what do we call it. Also, kill me ….
—Scott, Chicago, IL Q: You and Sal want to know which hated Super Bowl 49 team is the one that the rest of America is cheering for? The answer is obvious: Bane.
—John, Jackson BS: And that’s another fun plot from Sunday’s game that hasn’t gotten enough attention — has there ever been a Super Bowl matchup with more unpopular teams? Just call it the Haterade Bowl. Sunday’s winning coach should have his players just “pour” an empty Gatorade bucket on him and say it was Haterade. Q: I know that its at the expense of your Patriots, but isn’t there a little part of you that’s thrilled that Roger Goodell was given one last investigation to botch this season?
—Nate, Buffalo BS: Absolutely. Even better, he’s desperately hoping — yet again — that he can get through another press conference/how-is-this-guy-in-charge?/debacle/stammerfest without anyone asking questions like: “Are you 100 percent sure that your officials measure the PSI of footballs before every game, or do they just touch them like they’re watermelons at a farmers market and say, ‘That one seems fine’?” “Why in 2015 are teams allowed to keep their own ‘inspected’ footballs for two hours right before a game starts?” “Why do we allow teams to doctor their own footballs however they want? Do you realize no other professional sport would ever in a million years do this?” “Why did everyone blame the Patriots for those barely deflated footballs and nobody blamed your officials who touch the football after every play?” “Can you blink twice, ad-lib a sentence about the Oscars, then blink twice again just to prove to us that you’re not being remote-controlled?” Q: Is there a chance that you handed Roger Goodell the championship belt for Worst Sports Commissioner too soon? Sure, he’s got domestic abuse, dangerous Thursday night games, new rules that made defense laughable, a hypocritical penalty system, PEDs, concussions, Spygate, Bountygate, Deflategate … OH MY GOD, THAT’S HIS MUSIC! THAT’S VINCE MCMAHON’S MUSIC!!!!!!!!! I just watched an entire stadium of fans from one of America’s founding cities (Philly) cheer for a Russian heel and boo The Rock (one of the most likable and recognizable stars ANYWHERE)! As that happened, the fans at home made ‘CanceltheWWENetwork’ the #1 Twitter trend worldwide and it crashed the Network! It’s as if Vince wanted to remind people how bad he has been! Steriods, domestic abuse, and ignoring safety concerns? Vince has all that and a Gobbledy Gooker! Your move, Roger!
—James Rodgers, New York City BS: I tweeted this on Sunday night: “the Philly fans flipped over the Roman Reigns bandwagon and set it on fire.” But here’s the crucial difference: McMahon HAD a remarkable run. This might be a slump and only a slump. Goodell has never, at any point, had any type of a run. He’s your Vegas buddy who keeps leaving the blackjack table to take out more money from the ATM — only for eight solid years. Roger’s “worst commish” title is more than safe.3 Quick Rumble story: The Simmons family threw 30 numbers in a hat, then took turns picking them for our first-ever Royal Rumble pool.4 Everyone threw in 20 bucks, making it my son’s first gambling experience. As we neared the end, my daughter had Roman Reigns and my son had everyone else. My wife was finished, and I didn’t have anyone left, but no. 28 was my last number. So they count down to no. 28 … and it ended up being Cesaro. My son started laughing like a maniac and screamed, “You’re done! Thanks for the 20 bucks!” I’ve never been prouder. Gambling! I think he’s hooked. He’s only 7 — what could go wrong? Q: Read this. Essentially, since 2010, the Patriots have fumbled the ball 1/187 plays; the next best is 1/140, and the other 31 teams range from 1/76 to 1/140.
—Jim, Phoenix BS: And then read this FiveThirtyEight piece. That Sharp Football Analysis article was debunked, redebunked and unbunked on every corner of the Internet. But let’s keep forwarding it around. I’m starting to get ornery. Q: Here’s the problem with Spygate: People outside of New England in the years since don’t actually remember what happened. No amount of My Cousin Vinny references will clear this up, but someone needs to write a real article about Spygate this week. FU, idiots.
—Jay Scott, Northampton, MA BS: Forget the article; you can do it in one paragraph. What actually happened: In 2006, the league sent out a memo that teams were no longer allowed to tape opposing coaches’ signals from the stands; the Patriots ignored the memo when they played the Jets in 2007; they got caught with someone taping from the stands; as a penalty, they lost a 2008 first-round pick and paid $750,000 in fines; and they handed over six other tapes to Goodell, who destroyed them for reasons that remain unclear and handled the investigation in a typically confusing/bumbling/inexplicable way that became his trademark. That was Spygate. We thought about doing a 30 for 30 about it once; there wasn’t even enough for a 30 for 30 Short. “Spygate” = fantastic name, boring scandal. Hence, the embellishments as time has passed. Q: Wouldn’t it be great if President Obama treated a White House press conference like Belichick? A reporter could ask, “Is there a reason that the United States didn’t send a high level official to the march in Paris attended by other heads of state like Netanyahu, Abbas, and Merkel?” and Obama could just respond, “We’re on to immigration.”
—Eric, Los Angeles, CA BS: You just described Goodell’s latest lost opportunity to win America back — if he’d come out for today’s Super Bowl press conference and just done a dead-on Belichick impression for the entire hour. The Internet would have eaten it up. The NFL should reprogram his hard drive and have him do that one of these times. By the way, I agree with a reader named Rob from Australia — if the Patriots win on Sunday, Belichick has to say “On to Disney World.” He just has to. Q: How will you feel if Peyton Manning and Kobe Bryant both retire? Who is there left for you to hate?
—Tyler, Fort Worth BS: To be fair, I don’t HATE anyone. It’s sports. But when I wrote my sports-hate column in 2009, my Big Three was Kobe, Manning and A-Rod. Those were three of the biggest sports-hate icons of the past 20 years, along with Bonds, Favre, Clemens, Tyson and post-dog-fight Mike Vick. Now they’re gone. All of them. I actually envy all the non-Boston fans who sports-hate Belichick and Brady so much — those are the last two sports hate icons. The rest of us are stuck with the likes of Eli Manning, the Sedin Sisters and Corey Perry. Quick tangent: My 2015 sports-hate list is made up of 90 percent hockey players. That’s been one of my favorite things about owning L.A. Kings season tickets — hockey players are so much more detestable in person than on TV. You can really feel the venom in the stands. I mean, I don’t even sports-hate Corey Perry; I actually HATE Corey Perry. Here’s a typical Perry play:  Did you see that? Classic Perry — he does just enough to be an unredeemable dick, but not quite enough to be kicked out or thrown in jail. And he always seems stunned that someone got hurt even as they’re trying to pull his severed stick blade out of their kidneys. I can’t get involved in enough “Per-ry sucks!” chants at Kings games; I’ve even made my daughter start a couple of them. She hates Perry, too. Everyone hates Perry. You suck, Corey Perry. You really do. You suck. You suck, you suck and you suck. Hockey is the best. Remind me to write a “My 25 Least Favorite NHL Players” column soon. Q: If Rita Benson LeBlanc can convince a court that her grandfather is mentally unfit to own and manage the Saints, how long before Washington football fans set up a kickstarter to hire her lawyers?
—Jeremy, Cambridge, MA BS: Congrats to Deadskins fans; you narrowly edged Knicks fans and Lakers fans in the mailbag race to send me the most variations of the “How do we hire Rita’s lawyers if she wins?” jokes. Yet another huge honor for Daniel Snyder, the Corey Perry of NFL owners. Look out, Washington fans, he’s coming again! Q: Do you remember that time when the Patriots cheated the salary cap, gaining an unfair advantage over the rest of the entire league by being able to sign good, key, players so that they can win Super Bowls?  And then outside of a few written news articles, no one really cared?   … Oh shoot, wait, my bad. I’m sorry, that was the suddenly forgetful Jerry Rice’s 1990’s 49ers and John Elway’s back-to-back SB winning Denver Broncos.  —Ryan Doyle, Chicago BS: CHEATERS! Q: Pause this onside kick video at 18 seconds. Hauschka is clearly offside. His left, non-kicking foot is planted ahead of the line of scrimmage at the 35.5 yard-line before his kicking foot has made contact with the football. This clearly gives Hauschka an advantage, as he now has the ball straddled and just has to push it instead of kicking it. How didn’t any of the refs see this?  Three refs are literally staring at it!
—Ryan, Baldwin  BS: CHEATERS! CHEATERS!!!!!!!! Q: I just listened to the BS Report with your dad and J-Bug while wrapping things up at the office. It fully completed my transformation into F-you mode. F*ck Seattle, f*ck John Harbaugh, f*ck the Colts as a Team, organization and as a motherfucking crew, and if you want to be down with them then f*ck you too.
—Representing all Pats Fans, Nate in Upstate NY BS: Where can I preorder the 2015 Super Bowl video, Hit ’Em Up: The 2014 New England Patriots? Do they have to win the game first? Can I preorder it anyway? Hold on, I drank too much water today — I have to go deflate 12 footballs in my bathroom. The readers are taking over. I’ll be right back. Q: I was browsing Twitter and saw that Marcedes Lewis had a kid with an adult film star. What will be more embarrassing for this kid down the road — that his mother did porn for a living, or that his dad played for the Jacksonville Jaguars? 
—JJY III, The Lake, PA Q: Do you think Seattle’s equipment manager could deflate Kam Chancellor by a few PSI before next Sunday? 
—Nick O., New York Q: Is there enough Deer Antler Spray in circulation currently to get Richard Sherman healthy for the Super Bowl, or did Ray Lewis consume all of it to make it thru the 2013 playoffs?
—Mikey, DFW Q: Can someone tell Gronk to throw Richard Sherman out of the f****** club?
—West Hartford Q: As a punishment for Deflate-gate, I think Boston should have to forfeit its Olympic bid. Seriously, can we forfeit our Olympic bid?
—CJ, Needham, MA Q: I love the irony of having Richard Sherman whine about how cozy Robert Kraft and Goodell are when half his teammates have been suspended for “Adderall” over the last three seasons. I say this as a diehard Bills fan who fully believes Belichick is the Antichrist.
—Morgan Hoffman Q: Which would draw better TV ratings in 2015: the Pro Bowl, or Roger Goodell in a dunk tank where you get 3 throws for 10 bucks?
—Brian, Minneapolis BS: I’m back. Thanks to the readers for holding the fort. And for the record, a three-hour telecast of Goodell getting creamed in a dunk tank would be the 109th-greatest dunk-tank moment of all time, behind the 108 different times this happened with a ’70s or ’80s babe on Battle of the Network Stars when they were looking for any excuse to get them wet in a bathing suit. Here, watch. These three minutes single-handedly put me into puberty.  Q: Regardless of what is said during Super Bowl Week, Seattle will always love you. When Sonicsgate happened, you were the only national columnist that stood up and said, “This is a travesty.” You called Stern out on this TO HIS FACE and gave us a spot on your website to vent our pain (you even ran my email.) You were in on Russell Wilson before anybody and knew from Day One he was President Jesus. So despite whatever happens, you’ll always have a special place in the hearts of Seattle fans. Thanks for everything, and f-?-?-? the Patriots.
—Brian, Kenmore BS: Thanks, Brian. I love Seattle as well. It’s my favorite non-Boston city. I would live there if it didn’t rain so much and if the Sonics were still there. Thanks for the email, and f-?-?-? the Seahawks. Q: There are NFL-print Bounty Paper Towels. I repeat, NFL-print paper towels for “big messes”. I’ll let you take it from here.
—Nate, Buffalo BS: The official sponsor of the National Football League … literally and figuratively! Q: The Outfield’s “Your Love.” So fitting — Patriots fans singing in unison to a song about… CHEATING!
—Joe G., Long Island, NY BS: That’s not a song about cheating! Hold on, I’m looking this up. Josie’s on a vacation far away
Come around and talk it over (Uh-oh.) So many things that I want to say
You know I like my girls a little bit older
I just wanna use your love tonight
I don’t wanna lose your love tonight (Oh no! Wait, maybe this is a misunderstanding.) As you leave me, please, would you close the door?
And don’t forget what I told you
Just ’cause you’re right, that don’t mean I’m wrong
Another shoulder to cry upon
I just wanna use your love tonight, yeah
I don’t wanna lose your love tonight (Why? WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY? Only one thing can salvage this karmically — if Katy Perry covers “Your Love” during the halftime show. Name your price, Katy. We’ll start a Kickstarter fund right now.) Q: What would be the most appropriate thing to happen in the Super Bowl to end the Year of Goodell? Bad call? Halftime controversy? Power outage? Deliberate injury leading to one team winning?
—Rob, Abbotsford, BC BS: Another great question. We’ve already had seasons tainted by bounties, domestic violence, blackouts, impostor refs, PEDs … I mean, what’s left? Just gambling and concussions, right? So what about a blown-out version of Wilson’s may-or-may-not-have-had-a-concussion subplot from two weeks ago? Here’s how it would go: Late in the fourth quarter of a classic nail-biter, either Wilson or Brady gets crushed on a hit and is clearly concussed, somehow passes the sideline concussion test, comes back to win the game in dramatic fashion, wins the Super Bowl MVP, then tells the Disney cameras, “I’m going to Dez Bryant’s house!” They rush him to the hospital for “precautionary measures.” Two days later, we find out that, yes, he suffered a severe concussion. That leads to the usual Goodell crisis formula — a rash suspension, a protest, an independent investigator, and then the rash suspension getting eventually overturned in a report released seven minutes before the Final Four starts. Send this man another $44 million. Q: Why do I see Deflate Gate playing out like the Congressional Hearing in The Godfather II? The Senators, in this instance Goodell and the NFL, think they have Micheal Corleone, Bill Belichick, dead to rights. Almost smug in watching them twist in the wind. But then whoops, they mess up the investigation and it falls apart. It will end with Robert Kraft/Robert Duvall yelling for an apology as Peter King, Chris Mortensen, Mike Florio and assorted NFL suits quickly grab their papers and hurry out of the room.
—Alex Esposito, Ottawa BS: With apologies to everyone who compared Belichick to Worm from Rounders (“I’m always gonna look for that edge”) or Belichick to Darth Vader (with Brady as Luke), I’m partial to all references from The Godfather: Part II here if only because Belichick is the Michael Corleone of NFL coaches, Pete Carroll was once Fredo (in New England), and Belichick’s second press conference definitely set up a post-exoneration press conference with his consigliere, Robert Duvall (played by Jonathan Kraft), screaming, “THIS COMMISSIONER OWES MY COACH AN APOLOGY!”  And yet, it’s not the BEST possible movie clip. Here, look. Q: How great would it have been if Belichick went full villain on us for the Deflategate press just recited the Bad Guy speech from Scarface? “Say good night to the bad guy! Come on. The last time you gonna see a bad guy like this again, let me tell you. Come on. Make way for the bad guy. There’s a bad guy comin’ through! Better get outta his way!” It would have been the greatest press conference ever! Right?
—Dan, Chicago BS: Come on, like I wasn’t going to hire an animator to see what a Belichick/Montana speech might look like? Please, if you like the NFL, you like Scarface, and you don’t mind NSFW language, press “play” on this embedded link.  Q: What’s the over/under on Seahawk sack and/or touchdown celebrations that involve inflating/deflating a football?
—Ken N., New York BS: It’s the same as the over/under for Seahawks who will fail a PED test after the game: 0.5. That reminds me, here are my favorite Super Bowl props: Prop: Tom Brady over 25 or more completions (+120)
Prop: Tim Wright over 0.5 receiving yards (+115)
Prop: Michael Hoomanawanui over 6.5 receiving yards (+130) Reason: Lump these three together. Why? The Seahawks come out with their chests puffed in their 4-3, steer clear of any gimmicks, dare you to throw deep and dare you to beat them with 15-play drives. Well, Brady loves long drives. He loves picking teams apart. Watch for various multiple-TE packages that spread Gronk wide, watch for those not-illegal-receiver formations that fooled Baltimore, and watch Seattle’s secretly-not-that-good pass rush giving Brady too much time. This feels like a “Brady throws 40 times to nine different receivers” game to me.5 You heard me right — I am excited that my 37-year-old QB might throw 40-plus times against an excellent defense in the biggest game of the season. No, I’m not drunk. Prop: Luke Willson over 35.5 receiving yards (-130)
Prop: Marshawn Lynch over 21.5 receiving yards (-110) Reason: Both numbers are 15 to 20 yards too low. Also, you know how the Patriots have gotten killed by the wheel route all season? Well, go to the 43-second mark of this clip from the Packers comeback. The Seahawks LOVE running that play with Lynch. I’m starting to get nervous. Prop: Gronk will have over 22.5 more receiving yards than Doug Baldwin (-115)
Prop: Al Michaels will call a Gronk TD “A Gronking to Remember” (+750) Reason: Only because Belichick booked Baldwin a one-bedroom suite on Revis Island and put a “DO NOT DISTURB” sign on his door. I may or may not have made up the second prop. Prop: Brady for Super Bowl MVP (+180)
Prop: Lynch will grab his crotch after a TD (+250) Reason: Same for both. The Pats aren’t beating Seattle unless Brady has a great game, and Lynch isn’t scoring a TD without grabbing his crotch. So if you believe that either event is happening (Pats victory or Lynch TD), why not grab the extra odds? And wouldn’t you want to yell the words, “YES! CROTCH GRAB! I WIN!”? By the way, I did NOT make up the second prop. Q: A friend just sent me this old Marino commercial and the first thing I thought was how you could send in your Super Bowl pick, think twice about it, then yell “F-?-?-? it! Send it in!”
—Chris P., Toronto BS: I’m right there with you. Hold on, one more email. Q: Definitely just made the stupidest/best prob bet for the Big Game … on Katy Perry’s cleavage. The “yes” to “Will she show cleavage?” Is -800. I bet the “No” at +450. This is a win-win for me, because if she doesn’t show her majestic mammaries, America cries while I laugh my way to the bank. If she does, everyone wins, and I am out way less than my average weekend night!
—Scott B., Fort Lauderdale BS: Yep, these are my readers. Let’s get to my big Super Bowl pick … Patriots (-1) over Seahawks
Are we SURE Seattle’s defense is that good? The Seahawks aren’t playing at home. Their fantastic secondary suddenly has Earl Thomas playing with a dislocated shoulder and Richard Sherman playing with a mystery elbow injury. They slowly rebuilt their badass defensive reputation after back-to-back losses to Tony Romo (Week 6) and Austin Davis (Week 7) by beating Cam Newton, Derek Carr and Eli Manning, losing to Alex Smith, then beating Drew Stanton, Colin Kaepernick (twice), Mark Sanchez, Ryan Lindley, Shaun Hill, Newton again, then a one-legged Aaron Rodgers. Their pass rush is pretty good, but not great; it’s certainly not on the level of the 2007/2011 Giants. Even when they were at home, when Manning and Rodgers needed to drive on them for game-tying drives this season, they did it pretty easily. I don’t know if this year’s Patriots could beat last year’s Seahawks … but they can beat this year’s Seahawks. They won’t make dumb mistakes like Carolina did. They won’t wuss out on fourth-and-1 and fourth-and-goal like Green Bay did. They won’t let Wilson’s legs beat them. They’ll win the special teams battle against Seattle’s secretly flimsy special teams. They won’t allow Seattle’s pass rush to knock Brady around. They should be able to rip off long drives, protect the ball and keep Wilson and Lynch off the field … IF Brady plays well. Which brings me to my three biggest concerns: New England’s own shaky pass rush (perfect for Wilson to buy some time and do Wilson things), Lynch activating Beast Mode (just a tough matchup for the Pats in every respect), and Brady not totally being Brady (very possible). See, there’s a not-quite-good-enough Brady performance always lurking; we saw it during the second Giants Super Bowl, and we saw it during that terrific Packers-Pats game in November. It’s what happens when your QB hits his late thirties — when you’re asking him to throw 35-40 times a game to win, you know you’re getting a couple of ground balls, one wobbler, one awful pick and one wide-open deep pass that’s 2 yards too long. That’s what Seattle is banking on. Pressure over time. They don’t care if he’s Tom Brady. They care that he’s 37 years old. And that he doesn’t throw no-hitters, or even four-hitters, anymore. And that’s all fine. But here are the stakes for Sunday: If the Patriots win and Brady plays well, he’s the greatest QB of all time AND he shoves the last two weeks in everyone’s face. Normally, Super Bowls don’t hinge on one player or one question because too many people affect a typical football game. But this game actually does hinge on the question, “How great is Tom Brady at age 37?” My answer: not totally great, but great enough. I could totally see him standing on that platform on Sunday, four months after that disaster in Kansas City, fighting off tears and holding that Super Bowl MVP trophy. I could see Goodell quickly handing that Lombardi to Kraft and fading into the background before the boos get any worse. I could see Belichick answering Bob Costas’s first question by saying, “We’re on to next season” and giving that little shit-eating Belichick smirk. And I could see everything getting undermined the following day by some “new” revelation to Deflategate that gets debunked three days later. That’s my favorite football team, the New England Patriots, the perfect champion for a truly effed-up season. Last Week: 1-1
Playoffs: 5-5

186,Retro Running Diary: Super Bowl XLIX,"Super Bowl XLIX was like the last episode of The Sopranos (and I’m not the only one who thought so). I will always remember watching it, I will always be dumbfounded by the ending and I needed 48 hours to figure out what I thought happened. What was Bill Belichick doing? What was Seattle doing? What was EVERYONE doing? This isn’t a retro diary, it’s a retro retro diary. It’s time to relive, regurgitate, recelebrate and re-heart-attack the final 12 minutes of Super Bowl XLIX. A quick recap: With five minutes left in the third quarter, Seattle took a 10-point lead after Doug Baldwin’s touchdown catch featured the following subplots: the umpire/evil WWE referee picked off Darrelle Revis in the end zone, allowing Baldwin to escape from Revis Island for the only time all night; Seattle covered the “same team will score three times in a row” prop; Baldwin earned a 15-yard penalty for stealing Adam Carolla’s poop-the-football touchdown celebration gimmick (conspicuously omitted from NBC’s live NBC telecast!); Richard Sherman mocked the Patriots by yelling “Twenty-four!” to the sideline cameras twice (seemingly, once for Revis and once for Seattle’s score); and every Pats fan briefly thought I just don’t want to get blown out before rallying and shifting into “COME ON, WE HAVE TOM FAWKIN’ BRADY!” mode. New England’s next drive: three-and-out. (Uh-oh.) And just when it looked like Seattle was pulling away, it left two game-clinching drives on the table. The first one fell apart after Jermaine Kearse dropped a gorgeous lob pass on New England’s 20, followed by Golden Tate screaming somewhere in Michigan, “I don’t care if that was a fairly tough catch, I would have caught that!” The Pats went three-and-out after LeGarrette Blount summoned the Super Bowl ghosts of Laurence Maroney and BenJarvus Green-Ellis by getting stuffed two yards behind the line on third-and-1. The Seahawks responded with an even uglier three-and-out.1 This left the Patriots with 12 minutes to score twice while knowing … • They just went interception-punt-punt on their first three second-half possessions, and now they were trying to become the first team to win the Super Bowl after being down by eight or more in the fourth quarter. • They were 12 minutes away from being tortured by eternally annoying story lines like “No Super Bowl wins since Spygate,” “Can’t win when the QB throws normally inflated footballs,” “Would have gone 1-5 in the Super Bowl if two plays went differently” and even just “CHEATERS!” • If Brady were to rally back from 10 down, he would clinch GOAT status and foil Seattle’s chance for back-to-back titles (a semi-impossibility in the salary-cap era). If he were to fall short, it would mean three straight Super Bowl losses and a winter-spring-summer of “Maybe it’s time to change the offense so we’re not asking a 37-year-old quarterback to string together impeccable 13-play drives for four straight quarters on big stages because we can never run the ball when it matters and we haven’t had a deep threat since Randy Moss left” conversations. Forget about the “On to Cincinnati” joke. We would have been “On to a new offense.” On a personal note, this was the first Belichick-Brady Super Bowl I missed in person. Unexpected family obligations made up 90 percent of the reason why I stayed. The other 10 percent: I didn’t want to go back to Glendale.  No! NO! Actually, I didn’t want to go back. I didn’t want to return to the place that reminds me of my dad’s 60th Birthday Party Weekend That Went To Hell, the Pat O’Brien–Brady handshake, the Helmet Catch, Brady’s third-down Hail Mary that went 80 yards in the air and missed catching Moss in stride by six inches, the 19-0 season going up in smoke and giddy New York fans reacting like they were just rescued from being trapped in a well. My God. That city, and that stadium, will always be the Scene of the Crime. At least for me. I have never witnessed a more devastating Boston loss in person. So I stayed in California. And with 12 minutes to play, I wasn’t exactly regretting it. Time for the retro diary. We’re shifting to present tense for as much as possible. 12:10 (First-and-10, NE 32): After Brady got sacked on first down and threw a four-yard out on second down, the reeling Pats are facing an uber-crucial third-and-14 on New England’s 28. Does the normally superb NBC crew use this specific moment to bring up Deflategate, question Brady’s integrity and show Roger Goodell sitting glumly in his suite? Of course it does! Here’s how it sounds. Cris Collinsworth: “I said, ‘Tom, look me in the eye … ’” (Look me in the eye? What are you, his ninth grade principal? Didn’t you already tell us this story in the pregame show? And why are you bringing this up right before the biggest third down of my season?) Collinsworth: “‘ … and tell me you couldn’t have possibly said anything to a ball boy, an assistant coach, somebody in the organization to lead them to believe that you wanted air let out of the football.’” (Hold on, we’re on the edge of our seats. I don’t even care that my entire football season is on the line with THE CURRENT F’N PLAY. What did Brady say? Did he confess? I really hope he confessed, because I can’t think of another reason you’re bringing this up right now.) Collinsworth: “And he said, ‘Absolutely not.’ He could not have been more emphatic.” (Great. Great news. Also, if this were about Peyton Manning, Collinsworth would have thrown in, “And I wasn’t even a little surprised, because someday, we’re going to use Peyton Manning’s hemoglobin to cure cancer.”) As the word “emphatic” hangs in the air, Brady steps up in the pocket and drills a fastball to Julian Edelman for a 21-yard first down that (a) saves the 2014 season, and (b) may have concussed Edelman. See, Kam Chancellor annihilated him with what seemed to be a helmet-to-helmet hit … except NBC never showed us the right replay even though it had 367 cameras there. The AP later reported that Edelman was checked by doctors “after that series” and “cleared to return.” After that series. The NFL is hilarious. 9:52 (First-and-10, NE 49): A delayed screen to Shane Vereen for nine yards is followed by a senseless late-hit penalty by Earl Thomas for another 15. The Seahawks defense has clearly gone into “Game Settings” and tried to turn the penalties off. 9:36 (First-and-10, Seattle 27): Brady misses on a deep ball to Brandon LaFell (an unabashed “Let’s see how much Tharold Simon sucks”2 pass), followed by a 2-yard Vereen run that sets up another big third down. I say the words, “Just don’t take a sack here.” Worst-case scenario: sack, 48-yard Stephen Gostkowski shank. But Brady steps up in the pocket AGAIN and finds a wide-open Edelman over the middle for 21 yards. Unfortunately, Edelman thinks his name is “Julius” right now, but still … first-and-goal, Patriots! 8:38: With Edelman slow to get up, Al Michaels reminds us that Edelman is being “bothered by a hip.” Or a concussion. It’s one or the other. Just never forget: Michaels was the first announcer to save words on injury descriptions by only saying the body part itself. Had he been announcing the last scene of the “Red Wedding,” he would have said that Catelyn Stark was “out with a throat.” Seven catches and 97 yards for Edelman, by the way. 8:04 (First-and-goal, Seattle 4): Edelman runs the fake-inside-slant-pivot-outside-curl play (or as it’s unofficially known, “The Welker”), beats Simon by two yards … and Brady fires the football 275 mph and nearly decapitates him. Incomplete. There are vague flashbacks to Brady missing a wide-open Welker in Super Bowl XLVI — just because they were two frisky, possibly concussed white guys who were wide-open and got overthrown, but still. “That’s as open as you will ever get down at the goal line,” Collinsworth says. Ugh. 8:00: Fighting off more Welker/Super Bowl XLVI flashbacks. If we settle for a field goal here … Off a halfhearted play-action fake, Brady finds Danny Amendola over the middle … TOUCHDOWN! (Fellow Pats fan Jay Jaroch pointed this out: Amendola caught 10 balls for 129 yards and three touchdowns in the Baltimore and Seattle nail-biters. Together that adds up to J.D. Drew’s $14 million grand slam in 2007, right?) It’s a nine-play season-saver for Brady that is punctuated by Collinsworth yelping, “Woooo! This game is turning into something” and Michaels alluding to the pick ’em point spread. Anyone who parlayed “Brady will throw over 2.5 passing touchdowns to break Joe Montana’s record for career Super Bowl touchdowns” with “Al Michaels will make a gambling reference” is high-fiving. New score: Seattle 24, New England 21, Times I Texted My Dad Just To Make Sure He Wasn’t Keeled Over: Seven. 7:55 (First-and-10, Seattle 20): Wilson throws to a seemingly wide-open Dontelle Lockette off a nice play-action fake, only Lockette falls down and can’t grab it. The replay shows that Malcolm “Future Dave Roberts 2.0” Butler tripped and then slyly tripped up Lockette with his right hand … NO CALL! We’re finally even for end zone official Earl Hebner running that pick play on Revis. (By the way, I’m making up fake first names for these anonymous Seattle receivers all column. Like you’d heard of any of them before Sunday. You didn’t even blink when I typed “Dontelle Lockette,” admit it.) 7:48 (Second-and-10, Seattle 20): Lynch rambles for 5 before getting tackled by 18 Patriots. Confession: Lynch won me over during Super Bowl week when he infuriated the MAWGM (Middle-Aged White Guy Media) by stonewalling them at media day, then double-downing on the F.U. with an unexpectedly gregarious performance as Gronk’s costar in Conan’s epic Mortal Kombat bit. What’s better than an athlete effectively admitting, “I’m actually entertaining and hilarious when I want to be, but I refuse to waste it on sports media assholes”?3 You have my full support, Marshawn. Come to the Pats this spring! The only quote you’ll ever have to say before and after games is “On to (the next opponent).” And we’ll give you and Gronk a reality show. You can’t lose. Name your price.  7:06 (Third-and-5, Seattle 25): Coming off an NBC/Collinsworth “Russell Wilson is so great!” montage that conveniently omits Wilson going 9-for-24 for 94 yards with zero touchdowns and four picks with only three minutes to go in the NFC title game, Wilson misses a wide-open Lynch for what should have been a 20-yard completion. Important tangent: 2014 opponents killed the Patriots with the wheel route to running backs coming out of the backfield. In Friday’s Super Bag, I even picked “Lynch over 21.5 receiving yards” as one of my prop picks knowing Seattle was saving that play. Watching live with multiple Pats fans at my friend Jimmy’s house, we all agreed during the fourth quarter, “They haven’t run the wheel route yet, you know it’s coming.” Well, it came. Lynch came out of the backfield, pretended to run a slant, faked out Jamie Collins, turned it upfield … and for whatever reason, froze before continuing the route (and Wilson missed him). “He didn’t really believe (Wilson) was gonna throw it to him, I guess,” Collinsworth says. BECAUSE RUSSELL WILSON WOULD NEVER MAKE A MISTAKE! AND HE’D NEVER LOOK ME IN THE EYE AND LIE!!!!!4 7:00 (Fourth-and-5, Seattle 25): Punt, fair catch by Edelman on New England’s 36. What a lucky three-and-out: The Pats got away with pass interference and survived their biggest Kryptonite play. They’re 64 yards from taking the lead (glass half-full), 30 yards from field goal range (glass half-empty) and minutes from the worst turnover of Brady’s career (glass totally empty). This is one of my favorite Super Bowl wrinkles: Every two or three years, there’s that one real-time moment where you realize, Wow, this moment is bigger than the game … and this is the biggest game we have. This was one of those times. You could feel it. 6:52 (First-and-10, NE 36): Brady throws over the middle to Vereen … one-handed catch! “It is Shane Vereen time in this game,” Collinsworth says. I’m glad he brings this up. Super Bowl XLII: Laurence Maroney — 14 carries, 36 yards, 1 TD
Super Bowl XLVI: BenJarvus Green-Ellis — 10 carries, 44 yards, 0 TD
Super Bowl XLIX: LeGarrette Blount — 14 carries, 40 yards, 0 TD Just 38 carries for 120 rushing yards total in the last three Super Bowls? But wait … Super Bowl XLII: Kevin Faulk — 7 catches, 52 yards, 0 TD
Super Bowl XLVI: Danny Woodhead — 4 catches, 42 yards, 1 TD
Super Bowl XLIX: Shane Vereen — 11 catches, 64 yards, 0 TD The new-wave Patriots treat swing passes, screens and quick slants for that Faulk/Woodhead/Vereen target as pseudo-runs. They don’t care how their backs get yards, just that they’re getting yards. Check this out: Vereen/Blount: 29 touches, 117 yards, 0 TD, 5 first downs
Lynch/Robert Turbin: 27 touches, 154 yards, 1 TD, 4 first downs (The lesson, as always: This is why Belichick doesn’t spend money on running backs. I am not holding out hope for the Marshawn Lynch era.) 6:13 (Second-and-2, NE 44): Vereen for five more yards. First down. By the way, say good-bye to the Seahawks pass rush — they were already thin before Cliff Avril’s game-ending concussion, which allowed the Pats to neutralize a havoc-wreaking Michael Bennett shortly after he became the favorite in everyone’s “Which Player From Super Bowl XLIX Is Most Likely To Fail A Postgame PED Test?” office pool. 5:32 (First-and-10, NE 49): Edelman turns a short pass into a nine-yard gain by doing that crazy-low-to-the-ground-hop-forward thing. We don’t spend enough time figuring out how Belichick cloned Wes Welker with Edelman. Forget about Deflategate — that’s going to be the scandal that brings down the Belichick Patriots. 4:55 (Second-and-1, Seattle 42): Swing pass to Vereen for another first down … but wait! They call an illegal downfield block on Amendola even though (a) Seattle is setting more picks than Wes Unseld, and (b) again, SEATTLE SCORED BECAUSE THE UMPIRE RAN A PICK PLAY. Whatever. 4:47 (Second-and-11, NE 48): Seattle sends five guys … and an under-pressure Brady burns them with a Gronking To Remember over the middle for 20 huge yards. First down, field goal range. (Brady picked on the kind-of-secretly-overrated Chancellor for much of this drive, by the way.) That’s followed by a Vereen swing pass for no gain that Michaels describes verbatim like this … “Brady will sling it out, Vereen, and there’s Richard Sherman, whose girlfriend is pregnant, she’s due in about two weeks, but she’s here. He’s ready to go to the hospital in uniform if need be.” Hearing that reminds me of one of my favorite Jeff Cesario bits — about former NBC announcer Curt Gowdy’s penchant to throw obscure facts into the biggest moments of his broadcasts — so I make a mental note to find it on YouTube after the game. Of course, I find it because EVERYTHING is on YouTube. Three seconds left in the game, Nordquist back to pass … HE WAS BORN IN A VOLVO … he’s scrambling …   4:05 (Second-and-10, Seattle 32): Gronk spreads out wide and dusts Seattle linebacker K.J. Wright for another first down. It remains unclear why the Pats didn’t just spread Gronk wide on every play this season just hoping that the other team would defend him with a linebacker or strong safety. He would have finished with 476 catches for 5,245 yards and 56 TDs. 3:34 (First-and-10, Seattle 19): Shotgun, stacked line of scrimmage, Seattle’s linebackers on their heels and playing five yards off the line … and Vereen slices through the line for seven yards. For the record — this will be remembered as one of the most important Patriots drives of all time (and a signature moment for Brady’s career), but this was one of their BEST drives ever, too. They worked Seattle’s much-ballyhooed defense like a speed bag for five solid minutes. Vintage Brady. I have been watching football for 40 years — for me, I would have wanted only Brady or Montana in this specific spot. Nobody else. 2:57 (Second-and-3, Seattle 12): Seattle switches to zone, so Brady finds an uncovered LaFell for seven yards. That’s followed by the play clock running down, a seemingly unimportant timeout by Brady (hold this thought), and Blount’s first-down run for two yards. In the moment, I would have bet anything on one of two play calls: • Gronk spread wide, quick slant over the middle, tough catch in traffic while fending off borderline pass interference that never gets called, because Gronk gets officiated like NBA refs used to treat Shaq in the early 2000s. (I’m in full homer mode right now. Sorry.) • Edelman dekes Simon with the same fake-the-slant-and-spin-outside move that already worked for Edelman’s previous almost-TD. (Well, they didn’t spread Gronk out, so … ) 2:06: Touchdown, Edelman!5 Patriots 28, Seahawks 24. Brady’s last two drives: 13-for-15, 124 yards, 2 TDs. Brady on the second drive: 8-for-8. For the second time in his life, he can grab QB GOAT status if his defense can just hold for two minutes in Glendale, Arizona. This isn’t weird at all. Quick tangent on Edelman (nine catches, 109 yards, one TD): Last winter, Edelman passed up more lucrative free-agent offers to stay with New England, and only because he was smart enough to realize, “My quarterback is Tom Freaking Brady.” He could have spent the past season in Jacksonville risking his body and brain to catch a never-ending slew of Blake Bortles wobblers over the middle; we never would have thought about him again. (See: Decker, Eric.) Instead, he’s a Super Bowl hero. A possibly groggy Super Bowl hero, but a Super Bowl hero. I wrote about this story before, but after I ran into him with mutual friends during that shit-or-get-off-the-pot point of his free agency, Edelman raved about Brady for 10 solid minutes like John Travolta talking about David Miscavige. I came away thinking, That dude knows he won the wide receiver lottery. He’s not going anywhere. Well done, Edelman. He’s no longer just a good receiver with a name that makes him sound like the villain in a 1980s James Spader movie. He’s a Super Bowl champ, a perfect example of the whole “grass isn’t always greener” philosophy. And now, he gets to make up that lost money with his own cooking show. GIVE THIS MAN A SHOW! Screw it … I’m offering him a Grantland show! Name your price, Julian.  2:02: New England 28, Seattle 24. My emotions in this exact order … 1. Holy shit!!!!
2. TOM FAWKIN’ BRADY!!!!!!!!!!
3. Wait, I kinda wish we had scored AFTER the two-minute warning.
4. Does this game have to be in Glendale, Arizona?
5. How much time was left when Eli got the ball in Super Bowl XLII?6
6. (Looking around.) Who has cigarettes? 2:02: Collinsworth tells a story about Wilson remembering the time he held up his first Lombardi Trophy, immediately wanted one more and then decided he wanted six (like Michael Jordan). Did you ask him to look you in the eye before he told you that story, Cris? Holy mackerel, we have a lot of healing to do. 2:02: Kickoff … touchback. Now Seattle has three timeouts AND the two-minute warning. No squib kick there? Wait, am I questioning Belichick? My bad. 2:02 (First-and-10, Seattle 20): Seattle smartly spreads Lynch wide (oh God), where he pretends to run a slant (oh no), turns it outside (oh Jesus) and beats Jamie Collins down the sideline for 31 what-the-hell-just-happened yards. Why 2014 opponents didn’t figure out different ways to send their backs deep against New England’s linebackers over and over again will always be the third-biggest mystery of the 2014 Patriots season, narrowly trailing Deflategate and the fact that they spent their first-round pick on a guy with no ACLs. I was never NOT terrified of that situation. Two-minute warning. (The dirty secret of the Belichick era: For whatever reason, his Pats kept giving up backbreaking drives at the end of Super Bowls. The 2002 Rams, the 2003 Panthers, the 2007 and 2011 Giants, now the 2015 Hawks … basically, every team they played except the one with an out-of-shape Donovan McNabb running the first-ever 10-minute drill.) 1:55 (First-and-10, NE 49): Wilson to Kearse deep over the middle … broken up perfectly by Malcolm “I’m About to Be Famous But You Don’t Realize It Yet” Butler. That’s followed by Wilson taking too much time and being forced to burn a timeout. HUGE MISTAKE. Collinsworth kills time by making a good point: Seattle has been practicing two-minute drills all season, only without no-name turned hero receiver Dave Matthews7 involved (four big catches, 109 yards, one TD, working in a Foot Locker earlier this season). Is that a disadvantage here? Maybe. Speaking of disadvantages, every Pats fan is secretly bracing for (a) the wheel route to Lynch, or (b) the try-to-get-a–Brandon Browner–pass-interference play call that Seattle hasn’t uncorked from its pull-big-plays-out-of-our-asses wine bottle yet. Or as it’s more commonly known, The Eli Playbook. One of those plays is coming. 1:50 (Second-and-10, NE 49): And there it is! Broken up by Browner in the end zone! No flags! Wilson had time,8",2015-02-04T13:30:01+00:00,New England Patriots,Simmons
187,The NBA’s Furious 17: Capturing the Noncontenders’ State of Mind,"The NBA’s final regular-season week usually revolves around playoff seed positioning, MVP conversations, awards ballots, this Spurs picture, some unapologetic mega-tanking by the worst seven to eight teams, the annual “Ricky Rubio might be the worst shooter ever” conversation, the annual OKC newspaper article that revises Harden trade history,1 one hellacious contract-year run (hello, DeAndre!), one out-of-nowhere player blossoming (the Stifle Tower, everybody!), and, of course, fans of every potential no. 8 seed watching those epic 2007 Warriors-Mavs videos and thinking, Why not us? (That reminds me: Round 1, Celtics vs. Hawks, Brad Stevens back in his old, familiar Butler-against-the-world underdog situation, 5,000 Boston fans at every Atlanta home game, Paul Millsap’s achy shoulder, no Thabo Sefolosha, some off-the-court Hawks drama, at least one Isaiah Thomas Heat Check looming, Brad Stevens a second time … I mean, WHY NOT US?????????) But you know what else always happens in that final week? Unless you root for a team with a legitimate chance to make postseason noise, you can’t shake the nagging sense that you wasted your life for six months. Maybe injuries submarined your team’s chance to contend. Maybe your boys heroically overachieved … only they’re still headed for 39 wins, and you feel like an ass taking pride in this (but you do). Maybe your only highlight was your team jettisoning Josh Smith’s contract as if carving out a cancerous mole. Maybe the only redeeming part was playing a never-ending game of Intentionally Tanking, Or Just Plain Dreadful At Coaching? with Byron Scott or Derek Fisher. Maybe you live in Seattle, and you don’t have an NBA team anymore, but you get to bathe in the delicious-for-you karma of Everything That Keeps Happening To Clay Bennett’s Current NBA Team. Just know that you didn’t waste your life for the past six months. Every NBA season yields positives for the noncontenders, no matter how hopeless or snakebitten or talent-deprived or poorly run your favorite franchise might have been. Just for kicks, we’re throwing in a meaningful Dom Toretto quote to capture every noncontender’s state of mind. Let’s take this column a quarter-mile at a time. Tao of Dom: “That’s my dad. He was coming up in the pro-stock circuit. Last race of the season, he was coming into the final turn when a driver named Kenny Linder tapped his bumper and put him into the wall at a hundred and twenty miles an hour. I watched my father burn to death. I can still remember him screaming. The people who were there said my father died long before the tanks blew. They said it was me that was screaming.” I mean, what other Dom quote would you use for Knicks fans? Did their favorite team just spend $85 million last spring on a Derek Fisher mannequin and a 70-year-old tweeter who lives 3,000 miles away? (Yessir.) Are those the two people running the team? (Unfortunately, yes.) Have James Dolan’s last 15 seasons yielded just five playoff appearances, one playoff series victory and 11 under-.500 seasons? (Um, yeah.) So why should Knicks fans be feeling good right now? THEY HAVE A TOP-FIVE LOTTERY PICK!!!! It’s incredible, and it’s true: In the 21st century, the Knicks have lost 49 games or more a whopping eight times, only they’ve never picked in the top five of any draft. One problem: They kept dumping lottery picks or future lottery picks for established players like Antonio McDyess, Stephon Marbury, Eddy Curry and Carmelo Anthony. Another problem: They kept landing in the wrong top-10 spot … like no. 9 in 2003 (Mike Sweetney), no. 8 in 2005 (Channing Frye), no. 6 in 2008 (Danilo Gallinari), and, most painful of all, no. 8 in 2009 (Jordan Hill, taken one spot after Steph Curry). That’s right, your answer to the question “Who is every Knicks fan’s favorite draft pick of the 21st century?” is Danilo Gallinari. That all changes in May, when those embattled fans can enjoy their first genuine shot in 30 years at hoping the NBA commissioner fixed the lottery-for-them-again winning the lottery. Once that’s settled, they can enjoy multiple Chad Ford mock drafts, dozens of Okafor-or-Towns conversations, the inevitable “Mudiay could own New York, should we just take him?” groundswell, some trade-up/trade-down scenarios, my inevitable “Why wouldn’t the Knicks trade Melo and completely blow this up?” podcast with Zach Lowe, and then the draft telecast itself. In July, they can pretend desirable free agents like Marc Gasol or LaMarcus Aldridge might consider signing with their f’ed-up franchise. At least things might happen, right? Just remember, Knicks fans — hope is a good thing, and no good thing ever dies. Not even if James Dolan is involved. Tao of Dom: “I’m a boy who appreciates a good body, regardless of the make.” If USC asked me to teach a college course called “How To Be An NBA GM,” I’d split up my 12 weeks of seminars into two-hour, subject-specific classes like “Take Everything Billy King Did, Then Do The Exact Opposite,” “Jerry West’s Brilliant Summer of ’96” and “The Lessons of KAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHN!” Amazingly, “How The Hell Did Flip Saunders Become One Of The NBA’s Five Most Powerful Non-Owners?” wouldn’t be my Flip-related class; I’d much rather break down his amazing Love-for-Wiggins trade — maybe the only time an NBA franchise extracted more than 100 cents on the dollar for a perceived superstar. The key to that trade: Flip waited. Usually, NBA teams want to finish reshaping their rosters in June and July; they fear uncertainty heading into the upcoming season. Flip never wanted Boston’s pupu platter offer (the no. 6 pick in 2014, a Brooklyn pick, expirings and non-All-Stars), even if most teams would have panic-settled for it. He thought Golden State might budge on Klay Thompson and David Lee; they never blinked. So he waited for a miracle … and then, suddenly, LeBron was thinking about a Cleveland return and the rest was history. Flip sold super-high on Love AND landed a superstar-in-waiting. So what if he also spent nearly $100 million on Ricky Rubio, Kevin Martin and Chase Budinger, or that he inexplicably gave up a sweet Miami late-lottery pick for four months of Thad Young, or that he was the last person in Minnesota to realize that the 2014-15 T-Wolves should have been tanking all along? Flip can inhale the fumes of that Wiggins deal for years. Throw in this June’s top-five pick and things are looking up in Minnesota! We’ve almost reached the point when we can stop talking about the T-Wolves drafting two straight point guards directly in front of Stephen Curry. Almost. Tao of Dom: “You can have any brew you want … as long as it’s a Corona.”  They squandered the past three years because of the catastrophic Bynum trade and what Grantland’s Rafe Bartholomew dubbed the NBA’s first Ponzi scheme. So what’s left? Let’s see … Joel Embiid (missed his entire rookie season), Dario Saric (playing in Europe), Nerlens Noel (solid rookie year; looked extremely Theo Ratliffish), Robert Covington (an NBA rotation guy), a top-six lottery pick, Miami’s 2015 pick (top-10 protected), a future Lakers pick (they’d need a miracle to get it next month, otherwise it’s top-three protected in 2016 and 2017 and unprotected in 2018), a heavily protected OKC pick (expires after 2017; can’t be a lottery pick), about 297 second-round picks and all kinds of cap space. Keep in mind: They tossed away three years, and counting, for everything in the previous paragraph. It’s no different from how a private equity firm would gut a struggling company: strip it, lower the operating costs, profit short-term while figuring out what to do long-term, target cost-effective assets, then hope an improving market boosts the company’s value (which is exactly what’s happening with Philly). Every move made sense on paper. If you’re gonna stink in the NBA, you might as well S-T-I-N-K. If you’re gonna lose 60-plus games for two straight years, you might as well cheap out. If Jrue Holiday and Michael Carter-Williams could never be one of the best two guys on a title team, you might as well flip them for three lottery picks and improve your odds to find a franchise guy … right? It’s exceedingly logical. All of it. But if you’re asking me to find positives, it’s tough. The Sixers just became the first NBA team ever to say, unapologetically, “For two straight years and possibly three, we aren’t going to give a damn about the product we’re putting out … but by all means, please keep spending money on your seats.” Check out their season-ticket page: “THIS STARTS NOW” in all caps. What starts now? Giving a shit? You just stole money from your fans for two straight years. Are your season-ticket holders getting future credit for the two years they just threw away? And what customer would put up with a business that operates like this? Imagine your parents purchasing season tickets for the opera if the Met said, “Hey, this opera is gonna absolutely suck for the next three years, but starting in 2018 or 2019, we have a chance to be really good, so, um, can we have your credit card?” I shopped for season tickets on the 76ers website and found that, for the ludicrous price of more than $10,770, I could purchase two seasons in Row 13 of Section 113 (midcourt) for a team that just lost 120-plus games over the past two seasons and is probably headed for another 60 losses next season. No promise that it’s a fixed price for the rest of the decade, no incentive plan, nothing. STEALING YOUR MONEY FOR A THIRD STRAIGHT YEAR — THIS STARTS NOW. Sixers fans need luck with (a) the 2015 and 2016 lotteries, (b) the health of Embiid and Noel, (c) the Lakers pick, and (d) Saric. They need to know whether Embiid and Noel can actually play together. They have to hope that Sam Hinkie knows what he’s doing … and considering that he just punted on MCW after a year and a half, who knows? They have to trust that their owners, at some point, are going to spend money. It’s the illusion of hope, personifed. Just trust us. We know what we’re doing. Well, what if they don’t? What if this really is a Ponzi scheme? However it works out, Philly fans will always remember it. Either your NBA team will be good in two to three years, or this will become one of the five best 30 for 30s ever. There’s no third outcome. This starts now. Shut up and drink your Corona. Tao of Dom: “The thing about street fights … the street always wins.” Only two destinations truly matter to NBA players: the Los Angeles Lakers and the Miami Heat (we’ll get to them). That’s it. The Lakers will be fine. Bonus positive no. 1: Kobe’s Expiring Contract! Bonus positive no. 2: Cap space!!!!! Bonus positive no. 3: Hollywood! Bel-Air! Beverly Hills! Malibu! 75 degrees! Hot women! Bonus positive no. 4: Julius Randle can walk without a limp! At least for now! Bonus positive no. 5: Jordan Clarkson’s emergence as This Year’s Second-Round Sleeper Headed For Good Things means the Lakers would be “phenomenally, almost historically stupid” to overpay a severely declining Rajon Rondo this summer instead of “typically, par-for-the-course-lately stupid.” Bonus positive no. 6: Hypothetical Vegas odds for “Will Jeanie Buss push her brother Jimmy out in the next 12 months?” have shifted to -500 (YES) and +400 (NO). (I repeat: The Lakers will be fine, even if it is nice to see their fans suffer for a couple of years. Welcome to the real NBA world, you guys.) Tao of Dom: “A real driver knows exactly what’s in his car.” Now there’s something you never could have said about Jacque Vaughn. Shit, even an anonymous interim coach was able to light a late-season fire under Orlando’s likable young nucleus, a big reason why this is our best available NBA coaching job unless New Orleans opens up. Here’s what you have: five keepers (Elfrid Payton, Victor Oladipo, Aaron Gordon, Nik Vucevic and Top-Seven Lottery Pick TBD), a buttload of cap space and, of course, the Chance To Follow Jacque Vaughn. My dream scenario: Orlando nails that coaching hire (Billy Donovan?), drafts Duke’s swingman/stud/beast Justise Winslow (my favorite 2015 lottery pick/team fit, hands down) and finds a free-agent rim protector. If those three things happen? The Magic could make a serious run at Milwaukee and Utah for 2016’s Most Entertaining Young Team championship belt. God, I love the thought of Winslow on this team. That reminds me, is there a support group for sports fans who despised Duke for the past 20-plus years with a passion normally reserved for meter maids and traffic jams, only they thoroughly enjoyed watching the Blue Devils’ collection of 2015 players and even found themselves rooting for them a couple of times? Tao of Dom: “I saw Linder about a week later. I had the wrench in my hand. I hit him. I didn’t mean to keep hitting him, but by the time I was done, I couldn’t lift my arm. He’s a janitor at an elementary school. He has to take the bus to work … and they banned me from the tracks for life.” The good news for Linder? He belatedly recovered from his head injuries and became Sacramento’s newest VP of personnel. Just kidding. I don’t mind the nucleus here: Boogie Cousins (a borderline first-team All-NBA center who couldn’t get it because his team stunk), Ben McLemore (blossomed in Year 2), Rudy Gay (shockingly solid this season), great and loyal fans, a top-eight lottery pick coming, Boogie a second time, and Boogie a third time. If you want to keep going, we have a great 30 for 30 coming about how Sacramento saved the Kings from going to Seattle. Oh, and the Maloofs are long gone. So it’s not all bad. Even if the Kings just endured the worst 13-year run of any NBA franchise. The big question: When will the hilariously incompetent Vivek Ranadivé conquer New Owner Syndrome? When will he realize that you can’t keep changing coaches and front-office executives every six months like you’re replacing the oil in your car? When will he finally get the whole “You hire the front-office guy first, then HE hires the coach because they have to work together” sequence correct? Part of me hopes Vivek never figures it out; it’s just funnier this way. He’s gone through four coaches and roughly 42 different front-office guys already. He just turned basketball decision-making powers over to the well-liked Vlade Divac — someone who hadn’t been involved in the NBA, in any capacity, for 10 solid years. Who’s next after Vlade doesn’t work out? C-Webb? Bonzi Wells? The Christies? Lawrence Funderburke? Still, there’s a certain honor in rooting for the strangest, goofiest, most inexplicably incompetent franchise in basketball. When everything turns around, it makes the whole thing feel even sweeter. Trust me, I’m a Patriots fan. We stunk for the first 30-plus years of my life, then, all of a sudden, we didn’t. Keep your head up, Kings fans. And remember: At least you saved your team. Sure, you saved it and put it in the hands of someone who seems about as stable as Cookie from Empire. But at least you saved your team. Tao of Dom: “I said a 10-second car, not a 10-minute car.” There’s a really fun Ty Lawson summer deal coming. Maybe a three-way that sends Lawson and a second-rounder to Utah, Jrue Holiday and Utah’s 2015 lottery pick to Denver, and Rodney Hood and Trey Burke to New Orleans? Maybe Lawson for Darren Collison, Sauce Castillo and the rights to Sacramento’s top-eight pick? Or Lawson back to Charlotte for Kemba Walker, Charlotte’s top-12 pick and one pick swap before 2020? Something’s happening. He’s the best available point guard and the best change-of-scenery guy on the market right now. Someone will overpay for him. The best thing the Nuggets have going for them other than that Lawson trade and 2015’s lottery pick: They have Portland’s 2016 pick (lottery-protected) and a juicy future Memphis pick (protected 1-5 and 15-30 in 2016, top-five protected in 2017 and 2018, unprotected in 2019), and they can swap first-rounders with the 2016 Knicks. Which raises an interesting dilemma. Door A: Deal Kenneth Faried for a pick (he’s a classic buy-low candidate right now for any smart playoff team), deal the Gallinari and Wilson Chandler expirings before next February’s trade deadline, detonate their 10-minute car completely, then rebuild around their picks, buttloads of cap space and the future star of Taken 5, Jusuf Nurkic. So the Nuggets could easily detonate their 10-minute car, but they’d be punting on that Knicks pick swap since they’d be just as bad (or worse). Door B: Turn Lawson into pieces that keep them competitive (the Holiday/Utah pick three-teamer is perfect), keep everyone else, make a run at a no. 7 seed and bank on that 2016 Knicks pick swap paying real dividends. Can you think of a better 21st-century asset than the sentence, “Next year, we get to swap first-round picks with the Knicks”? It’s neck-and-neck with Apple stock. I vote for Door B. Here’s my favorite Nuggets stat, though: Denver from October 2007 through December 31, 2013: 316-190 Denver from January 1, 2014, until now: 22-30 + 29-49 What happened on January 1, 2014? Colorado legalized marijuana. We’ll be back on “Probably Just a Coincidence,” right after this. Tao of Dom: “Ask any racer. Any real racer. It don’t matter if you win by an inch or a mile. Winning’s winning.” The SVG plan: Dump Josh Smith (done); let someone else overpay Greg Monroe (imminent); pay Reggie Jackson (just don’t overpay him, for god’s sake); build around Andre Drummond, Jackson and a Top-10 Lottery Pick X (in motion); spend smartly this summer on a stretch 4 and one more 3-point shooter (doable) … I mean, there hasn’t been a safer time to buy Pistons season tickets since Obama got elected.2 Quick Pistons tangent: I graduated from college in 1992, the same year Chuck Daly left the Pistons. Do you know how many head coaches they’ve had since then? Fourteen! The complete list: Ron Rothstein (one year), Don Chaney (two years), Doug Collins (two and a half years), Alvin Gentry (two years), George Irvine (one-plus years), Rick Carlisle (two years), Dick Puller (one year), Larry Brown (two years), Flip Saunders (three years), Michael Curry (one year), John Kuester (two years), Lawrence Frank (two years), Mo Cheeks (50 games), John Loyer (interim: 32 games), Stan Van Gundy (one year).3 One more Pistons tangent: The Pistons joined the BAA/NBA in Fort Wayne while playing in 1948. They hired someone named Carl Bennett as their first coach … and promptly fired him after going 0-6. Over the next 34 years, they employed 19 other head coaches, including Dave DeBusschere (as a player-coach), Herb Brown and the one and only Dick Vitale (you read that correctly). Daly lasted for an entire decade (1983 through 1992); no other Pistons coach made it to the end of his fourth year. The Pistons have employed THIRTY-FIVE head coaches in all, compared to 27 for the Royals/Kings, 26 for the Knicks, 25 for the Lakers, 25 for the Warriors, 23 for the Bullets/Wizards and 17 for the Celtics. Just having a competent head coach is a huge, huge, huge victory for Pistons fans right now. (See, I told you this column would be positive!) Tao of Dom: “You’re gonna need more than that crotch rocket.” We might have to rename that 35-40 wins/borderline no. 8-spot/late-lottery area “Charlotteland.” The poor Horbobnetcats never intended to land there again, but that’s what happens after you whiff on Lance Stephenson and watch helplessly as Al Jefferson transforms into a 45-year-old man. Now they have three solid youngsters (Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, Kemba Walker and Cody Zeller), a top-12 pick and little else. That would be fine except they’ve had a whopping 15 first-rounders since 2004. FIFTEEN! Do you realize they picked second in ’04; then fifth and 13th; third; eighth and 22nd; ninth and 20th; 12th; ninth and 19th; second; fourth; and ninth and 24th? Some sweet picks, right? Not if you took Brandan Wright, D.J. Augustin and Noah Vonleh one spot before Joakim Noah, Brook Lopez, and Elfrid Payton. Not if you were one spot away from Dwight Howard, LaMarcus Aldridge and Anthony Davis … and ended up with Emeka Okafor, Adam Morrison and Kidd-Gilchrist instead. The Horbobnetcats haven’t drafted a single All-Star since Baron Davis … in 1999. Since the first incarnation of the franchise launched in 1988, Charlotte missed the playoffs 16 of 25 times, won just four playoff series and never advanced past Round 2. So what’s positive about any of this? If you look at the NBA’s 2014-15 attendance numbers, Charlotte ranked 19th at 17,227 fans per game — just behind the Hawks and Grizzlies and ahead of the Pelicans and Suns. They even raised ticket prices by 5 percent for next season! So that’s my positive for Charlotte: It’s a franchise blessed with loyal NBA fans who aren’t ashamed to admit that they love mediocre basketball and poor decision-making. Tao of Dom: “Ride or die — remember?” Assets: Dwyane Wade, Goran Dragic (probably), Chris Bosh, Hassan Whiteside on a minimum contract next season, South Beach, Riley and Spo, Stugotz and Mike Ryan, no Florida state income tax, South Beach a second time, Micky Arison’s yacht, the summer of 2016 (hold this thought). Negatives/Concerns: No first-rounders in 2015, 2017 (top-seven protected for two years, unprotected by 2019) or 2021; Bosh’s health; Wade’s age (34 next season); the possibility of Dragic double-crossing them and signing somewhere else (doubtful); the Le Batards; Hassan Whiteside unraveling (always in play); Hassan Whiteside turning into a pumpkin; Hassan Whiteside remembering that he’s Hassan Whiteside. You know how Knicks fans think their team will be fine because everyone always wants to play for a big market? Actually, Miami is the Eastern Conference team with a 20-year track record of landing marquee players — Alonzo Mourning and Tim Hardaway (mid-1990s), then Juwan Howard (1996 for about 10 seconds before the NBA voided that deal), then Eddie Jones and Brian Grant (2000), then Shaquille O’Neal (2004), then LeBron and Bosh (2010), then Dragic (2015). Again, it’s the franchise that convinced LeBron to leave Ohio in his prime. Dudes will always want to play in Miami. For that and many other reasons, here’s your stealth Durant/2016 destination. Not Washington, not New York, not Los Angeles. Here. South Beach. They’ve done it before; they’ll do it again. Miami will ALWAYS be fine. That’s why Riley doesn’t care about giving up those future first-rounders. Ride or die — remember? Tao of Dom: “You don’t turn your back on family, even when they do.” That quote made me think of the Pacers because they built such a potent family atmosphere there. What other franchise could lose Paul George (one of the NBA’s best two-way players) and Lance (their second-best creator/defender); rebuild on the fly around Roy Hibbert’s ghastly low-post game, Rodney Stuckey’s scoring and a bunch of C.J. Miles types; tell Luis Scola, “We’re gonna need you to ramp it up,” and then somehow stay lurking for a no. 8 seed with one week to go? NOBODY would have blamed them for throwing away the season. They refused. They believe their fans are family … and you don’t turn your back on family, right? I thought the whole thing was awesome. Great job by the Pacers. That’s what sports are all about. So what’s left? Let’s see … Larry Legend, Frank Vogel, a finally healthy Paul George, a lottery pick, the NBA’s best building, the basketball capital of America, lots and lots of cap space and a proven track record of plucking bargain free agents. They’re fine. By the way, I’d like to officially elevate Indianapolis to the no. 3 spot behind New Orleans and Miami on the “Best Host For Any Big American Sporting Event” rankings, just ahead of Las Vegas and San Diego and 300 spots ahead of Jacksonville. Tao of Dom: “It starts with the eyes. She’s gotta have those kind of eyes that can look right through the bullshit, to the good in someone. Twenty percent angel, 80 percent devil. Down to earth. Ain’t afraid to get a little engine grease under her fingernails.” One of my favorite Dom quotes goes to my favorite NBA renaissance: In less than 12 months, the Jazz found a real coach (Quin Snyder), stumbled into a 22-year-old shot-blocker/rebounder (the Stifle Tower), watched Gordon Hayward and Derrick Favors blossom into legit pieces, created a genuine wrestling heel for their fans (Enes Kanter, Utah’s no. 1 enemy for the next 10 years)4 and struck oil with the best 18-year-old in the history of the NBA draft (Dante Exum). Fine, I made up the Exum part. But everything else happened. This summer, the Jazz need to either (a) sign an impact point guard, or (b) turn their top-12 pick, Burke, Hood and/or one of their future first-rounders from G-State and OKC into an impact point guard like Lawson (as described above). Whatever it takes. And yes, these guys would have stolen 2015’s hypothetical Entertaining As Hell Tournament and grabbed one of the no. 8 seeds. Tao of Dom: “I’ve cared about the Nets my whole life, ever since we lived in Brooklyn in the mid-’80s. My father used to take me to Nets games. One year, I was a ball boy for them. Buck Williams asked me to park his car for him once. It was a Ferrari. I was 12 years old. I got behind the wheel and something was pulling me away from that parking lot. I got on the highway and just started driving. It was the first time I ever felt free. I drove all the way to New Mexico and back in three hours. They didn’t even know I was gone. Buck Williams never knew how important he was to me. We need to save the Nets. We need to take down Billy King. This is about family.” Fine, Dom didn’t say any of that. But after all the lottery picks Billy King has already given up, it’s amazing that we’re entering the heyday of lottery picks that Billy King is about to give up: a pick swap with Atlanta in 2015 (ouch) and Boston in 2017 (double ouch), as well as Boston getting Brooklyn’s unprotected picks in 2016 and 2018. That’s four years of giveaways! That’s an entire presidential term of genuine front-office incompetence! And we didn’t even mention King winning last summer’s power struggle with Jason Kidd … who improbably turned into a good NBA coach in Milwaukee. The whole thing is amazing. So, how can this be positive? Easy. The Nets are zigging when every other mediocre-to-lousy team is zagging. They can’t tank because there’s no light at the end of the tanking tunnel. Not until 2019. Hence, they’re exploiting the Overpriced Competent Veteran Market with trades like “Expirings for Jarrett Jack” and “The Artist Formerly Known as KG’s Expiring Contract for Thaddeus Young.” This year, King willed a 30-win team to 39 or 40 wins. Next year, he’ll make two more Jack/Thad-type trades and maybe he’ll get to 45 wins. Remember, there’s nobody else exploiting the Overpriced Competent Veteran Market. It’s just Billy. This might work. And with the rejuvenated Brook Lopez (assuming he stays) and two big expirings to trade (Joe Johnson in 2016, Deron Williams in 2017), there might actually be light at the end of Brooklyn’s tunnel. In Billy King we trust. (Important: I don’t believe anything in the previous paragraph … I was just being nice.) Tao of Dom: “I live my life a quarter-mile at a time. Nothing else matters: not the mortgage, not the store, not my team and all their bullshit. For those 10 seconds or less, I’m free.” Dom’s greatest quote goes to the greatest on-the-fly rebuilding job in recent NBA history: In less than 24 months, the Celtics turned two Hall of Famers, an All-Star point guard, the league’s most expensive coach, Jeff Green and Jason Terry into Brooklyn’s unprotected 2016, 2017 and 2018 first-round picks; a 2015 Clippers first-rounder; a 2016 Dallas first-rounder (top-seven protected); a future protected Memphis first-rounder that becomes unprotected in 2021; Isaiah Thomas; Jae Crowder; Tyler Zeller; James Young; Gerald Wallace’s 2016 expiring; Philly’s second-rounders in 2015 and 2016; Minnesota’s second-rounders in 2016 and 2017; four other second-round picks; and last but not least, 2016 President-Elect Brad Stevens, a coach who’s so ridiculously good that the Celtics might grab a no. 7 seed during the same season in which they dealt their two best players and suited up 22 different players. I’ve never felt better/prouder/happier/giddier about a team that’s six games below .500. What a season. So, what happens going forward? Get a taste of the playoffs, show the rest of the NBA (and every free agent, as well as the agents of those free agents) that you happen to employ a coach who’s a freaking Jedi, keep mastering that pace-and-space/balls-to-the-wall style, and eventually, the Celts can land one or two difference-makers (either with their picks or with a package that comes for those picks). They are exceedingly well positioned — they have the coach, the front office, the role players and the right style. They just need (gulp) the franchise player. It’s like watching someone serve an absolutely perfect four-course dinner that doesn’t have an actual entrée yet. Well, that entrée is coming. One quarter-mile at a time, baby. Tao of Dom: “You know what they say where we’re from? Show me how you drive, I’ll show you who you are.” Here’s what the Bucks are showing us: We’re young, we’re long, we’re loaded with upside, we’re a bitch to play, we can defend anyone, and we’re headed for bigger and better things. I love everything about what’s happening here, and when Jabari Parker comes back, even better. They could absolutely topple Toronto in Round 1. Don’t be shocked. Allow me a quick Giannis Antetokounmpo tangent: He’s been celebrated on the Internet for months if only because few things are more fun in 2015 than a freak NBA athlete with (a) a great nickname, (b) a ton of promise, and (c) a style that translates easily to Twitter, Vine and YouTube. Nobody knows where this is going. He’s only 20. But I’ve seen enough “Milwaukee clears out for Giannis because he’s feeling it” quarters to justify making the following comparison without feeling like a maniac: I attended a slew of Celtics games in the late 1990s because my father (who paid for our tickets) hated watching Rick Pitino and Antoine Walker and never wanted to go. I watched Young T-Mac on Toronto in person probably six or seven times. As a rookie, he looked totally lost. During Year 2 and the first half of Year 3, he looked like a safe bet to be the Robin to Vince’s Batman — the second banana, the defensive stopper, the guy who could carry your offense when Batman was out, Vince’s own personal Pippen. Then, I remember seeing the Raptors after the 2000 All-Star break and T-Mac just looking different. You might remember this game because Vince drained a buzzer-beating 3 to win it:  But I remember leaving it thinking, Holy crap, T-Mac is gonna be ridiculously good. Suddenly he could handle the ball, shoot 3s, bounce off people in traffic, quick-jump over people for rebounds, defend anyone he wanted … I mean, you could just SEE it. You know what’s really crazy? Because the Internet lost its mind about two years ago, somehow there’s an edited YouTube clip of every good thing T-Mac did in this totally random game:  Here’s the point: T-Mac averaged only 15.4 points with 45-28-71 percent splits that season. His points-per-game for his next three years in Orlando: 26.8, 25.6, 32.1. Everyone knew we were headed for good things with T-Mac in Boston that night, but nobody knew we were headed for THAT. During Durant’s rookie year in Seattle, the same freakish pieces were in place, only it seemed a little more conceivable that a mega-blossoming was coming because of his pedigree. With Giannis, it’s a little more under-the-radar — like it was with T-Mac in Year 2. He’s like a Durant/T-Mac scoring fetus. I can see it. How he bounces off people in traffic, how he gets his shot off from crazy angles, how he explodes to the rim, how he gets good shots off even when his opponent is playing perfect defense. I’m telling you, real stuff is happening here — glimpses, pieces, flashes, but real stuff. In his second year, Giannis isn’t even scoring 13 points a game. I bet that doubles within three years. I know they don’t sell Bucks stock, but buy it anyway. Tao of Dom: “Running ain’t freedom. You should know that.” They turned last season’s delightfully entertaining, unexpectedly promising and precociously young run-and-gun Suns team into this season’s sullen, disjointed mess of a whatever-the-hell-happened-here. They turned Eric Bledsoe into a borderline max guy. They antagonized Goran Dragic by bringing in a third point guard, played him out of position for three months, took it personally when he bitched to the press, then panic-downgraded from Dragic (I voted him second-team All-NBA last season) to Brandon “You’re Gonna Have To Overpay Me So This Doesn’t Look Like a Total Disaster” Knight. They essentially flipped Dragic, Isaiah Thomas, Tyler Ennis, Miles Plumlee and that famously tasty Lakers pick (top-five protected in 2015, top-three protected in 2016 or 2017) for Knight and three non-lottery picks (Cleveland’s 2016 first-rounder and Miami’s 2017 and 2021 first-rounders). Buried under everything: Jeff Hornacek’s mysterious free fall from “2014 Coach of the Year Candidate” to “Possessed by the Spirit of Vinny Del Negro.” No 2014-15 team blew more winnable games in dumber/unluckier/more inexplicable ways than the Suns. They were a 50-win team that somehow went .500. Then again, they STILL would have been a top-six seed in the East. Nail the lottery pick in June, sign Knight for a fair price and maybe they’re back in business. Stay positive, Suns fans. And definitely don’t read this footnote.5 Tao of Dom: “You’ve got the best crew in the world standing right in front of you. Give them a reason to stay.” They made the Finals in 2012. They lost in Round 2 in 2013. They lost in Round 3 in 2014. They probably aren’t making the playoffs in 2015. Harden plays for Houston. Durant’s contract expires in 2016. Westbrook’s contract expires in 2017. (Um … ) (Wow, this is awkward.) Wanna watch the scene from Furious 6 where Dom saves Letty?  (So, um … ) (Let’s just wrap the column up … ) (Thanks for reading … )   This column has been updated to correct an error: It was Herb Brown, not Hubie Brown, that coached the Pistons.",2015-04-10T15:21:33+00:00,NBA,Simmons
188,The Saturday Decision,"During Eddie Murphy’s first SNL season, Joe Piscopo started appearing on “Weekend Update” as a goofy sports anchor who shouted the big stories in exclamation points. Saturday would have been perfect for him. NHL playoffs! Kentucky Derby! Game 7! The big fight!!! SATURDAY!!!!!! It’s looking like an all-time, tell-your-grandkids-about-it-40-years-from-now sports day. May 2, 2015. In my first playoffs mailbag column two weeks ago, you might remember me seeing the NBA’s schedule for Round 1 and fretting about one of the all-time sports fan conundrums. If the Clips-Spurs battle miraculously produced a Game 7, that would undoubtedly happen on Saturday night. I already had my ticket for that hypothetical game. But I also had a chance to attend Floyd-Manny, which meant witnessing a once-in-a-generation fight in Vegas with my L.A. buddies. Can’t lose either way, right? You never want to make a tough decision until you HAVE to make a tough decision … and now we’re here. Game 7, Spurs at Clippers: 5 p.m. PT, Los Angeles. Or … Mayweather-Pacquiao, 8:30 p.m. PT (approximately), Las Vegas. Pick one. (Yikes.) Here are the for-and-against cases for Game 7 and The Fight. The Case For Game 7: Even before it officially became “One of Best Round 1 Series Ever,” we knew it had a chance to broach “Feels Like The Finals If They Happened In Round 1” (which is exactly what happened) … I attended Games 1, 2 and 5 in L.A., and they were more like life experiences than basketball games … thanks to those quietly dramatic Hack-a-DJ moments, these contests balloon to nearly three hours and feel a little like those Yankees–Red Sox nail-biter marathons from 2003 and 2004 (without 86 years of baggage and eight decades of hammer-versus-nail story lines, but still) … potentially, the final basketball game ever for one of my favorite non-Celtics ever, The Great Tim Duncan (I think that’s officially his name now) … if the Clips were to lose a Game 7 at home, we’d inch even closer to a career scenario with CP3 and Blake that becomes a Hottest of Hot Takes cross between “The Poor Man’s Stockton and Malone” and “The Sedin Brothers of Basketball” … seeing Kawhi the Sharktopus in person in Game 7 mode (hold this thought) … Pop Sarcastically Working The Refs vs. Doc Sarcastically Working the Refs in the Game 7 of Sarcastic Reactions … the biggest game of CP3’s life, hands down … the biggest game of Blake’s life, hands down … it’s a Legacy Game in every respect. Wait, there’s more! You KNOW Joey Crawford will be there (if you’re a Spurs fan: gulp) … Game 7s are ludicrously tense anyway, but imagine a Game 7 with the home crowd sweating out that ghastly Clips bench twice per half (it’s like 20,000 Little League parents watching their uncoordinated son settling under a fly ball in right field, but for 10 solid minutes) … Austin Rivers in a Game 7!!!! … oh, and it might be the end of The Second Duncan-Pop era (or yet another triumph) … can the Clips remember what they learned in Game 6 (keep your heads down, just play, don’t let the refs bother you, keep your poise) and apply it to Game 7? … can Clippers fans affect the game without coming off like a bunch of whining maniacs who inadvertently work their boys into a whining froth (and vice versa?) … I could keep going and going, but one thing I’ve learned in life is that there’s really never a good excuse to miss a Game 7 … in fact, you can use that for your high school yearbook quote if you’re under 18. “One thing I’ve learned in life: There’s really never a good excuse to miss a Game 7.”
—Bill Simmons The Case For The Fight: We’ve been waiting for Floyd-versus-Manny for six to seven solid years … it’s the biggest of Big Fights … it’s in Vegas … that means you get to gamble on the fight AND play blackjack afterward, an appealing scenario for anyone with a gambling problem (not me) or anyone who loves to gamble while repeatedly claiming that they don’t have a gambling problem (hey, that’s me!) … I’ve been to a couple of Big Fights in my life, and, from a buzz/electricity/eye candy/celebrity/fashion/comedy standpoint, there’s simply nothing like them … just enough people made a solid “No no no, Manny has a real chance if he can throw punches from every angle for 12 rounds!” case that I’m slightly wavering on my belief that Floyd will whup him handily … you can still get reasonable odds on either guy (-200 for Floyd, +170 for Manny) … it’s a Legacy Fight, obviously … and seeing Floyd in person, for any reason, is unlike just about anything else … it can never be forgotten that Messi and Floyd are better at what they do than anyone else is at anything. Unfortunately, Floyd also spent the past eight years transforming himself into the real-life Clubber Lang (a villain from central casting, basically), only if Clubber had also been convicted twice of striking women and had other alleged domestic violence incidents on his résumé. Yeah, Floyd was always a difficult person to like or understand. But a relentless (and deserved) assault by the media and on social media, too, has rendered him so completely unlikable that the unthinkable happened. Within the past two weeks, a groundswell of media members have been imploring everyone to boycott the fight … and they didn’t seem crazy. I will not be boycotting the fight for two reasons. First, I have been a boxing fan since I fell in love with Ali during the mid-1970s, back when Ali’s Wide World of Sports appearances resonated in ways that you couldn’t possibly understand 40 years later. We had only like six channels back then. Ali passing through ABC’s orbit on a Saturday afternoon trumped anything else that could ever possibly happen on a Saturday afternoon. So I got hooked on boxing at a young age by someone who, truly, was “The Greatest.” And I never regretted it, even after I grew up and realized that boxing employed more criminals, thugs and despicable characters than every other professional sport combined. It’s the only sport where an announcer can say, “He’s a young 35,” and that’s an understood code for “He spent a few years in jail.” Of the top 200 moments in my life when I said to myself, purely as a sports fan, “I don’t know if I feel good about this,” I think boxing was involved in 185 of them. We’re not making the world a better place through boxing; that ship sailed long ago. Remember, the goal of boxing is to repeatedly punch your opponent, either to accumulate points or to knock him unconscious; it’s one of the most primitive sports we have, and if you’re thinking about attaching humanity and morality to it, you’re fooling yourself. Watching Saturday’s fight doesn’t mean that you condone Floyd’s vile behavior. It’s apples and oranges. This isn’t a sport where you can just pick and choose your viewing based on some arbitrary (but well-intentioned) moral compass. It doesn’t exist. Not in boxing. Any serious sports fan has battled that choice for three decades and counting, right around the time Ali’s abrupt deterioration made tangible a cause-and-effect to what we had watched (and condoned, too). When I was growing up, boxing always mattered. Now it matters in once-a-year spurts. And every time it matters, that spawns a new round of people grappling with the morality of it — a conversation that feels louder in 2015 because everything is louder in 2015. In the Twitter/Hot Take/Shame Police era, it’s all about extremes. And that’s the thing about boxing — it was always the nuances that made it so interesting. Some of the finest sportswriting ever tackled those very nuances: like Gay Talese’s famous Floyd Patterson feature for Esquire or Mark Kram’s unforgettable Sports Illustrated piece on the final (and particularly brutal) Frazier-Ali fight. This isn’t an either/or thing. It’s complicated. And we’re not solving it this weekend. Second and more important, what’s going to be more entertaining than rooting against Floyd Mayweather? He’s the greatest boxing villain we’ve had since George Foreman 40 years ago! How can anyone not dislike this guy? We get to root for someone to punch Floyd in the face for 12 rounds? I’m supposed to BOYCOTT this? Stop it. Since Floyd is getting his $175 million (or whatever it ends up being) either way, why not find a way to watch the fight and root for Manny? This is 1980 USA vs. USSR crossed with Douglas vs. Tyson in Japan crossed with Balboa vs. Drago in Russia. I wagered on Floyd two months ago (parlaying him and the Cavs to win the East), got swayed by all the anti-Floyd pieces (and they keep coming and coming), and eventually made a second wager on Manny to divest all financial interests. I’m rooting for Manny Douglas Balboa Eruzione to ruin Mayweather’s undefeated record, upend his legacy and represent the Karma Police against an unusually vile opponent. Boycott? Please. The Case Against Game 7: I mean, shit. It’s Game 7. Even Johnnie Cochran in his prime couldn’t make a good case against a Game 7. And it might be Duncan’s final game, too? And a fork-in-the-road moment for Blake and CP? The only “case” I can make against it: Add up Hack-a-DJ plus commercials plus prime-time TV timeouts and this baby could swell past 8 p.m. PT; throw in an unexpected overtime and suddenly you’re looking at 8:30 (yeeeesh), and that’s without factoring in the Staples Center exit (never easy) and traffic (always there). So, yeah, attend Game 7 and there’s a real chance of missing a chunk of the fight (which, based on the history of these fights, probably won’t start until 8:45 p.m. PT). If you’re watching on TV? Perfect. Game 7 will bleed right into the fight. If you’re going to the game? Different story. Whatever time this game ends, I’ll be the guy weaving through the postgame crowd like Barry Sanders and driving home like Dom Toretto. Ride or die. The Case Against The Fight: We’re getting it five solid years too late; it’s like Bird and Magic finally meeting in the NBA Finals, only if it had happened in 1991 with a slightly past-his-prime Magic taking on a broken-down Bird and his 30-pound back brace. My biggest problem with the timing of this bout: In December 2012, a cartoonishly enhanced Juan Manuel Marquez — who had never come close to knocking out Manny in their previous three fights, by the way — was suddenly throwing frightening haymakers and repeatedly rocking the unrockable Manny. Everything crested with one perfect punch, as Marquez briefly unplugged Manny’s brain for nearly two minutes as everyone frantically Googled “Marquez” and “HGH.” He didn’t just knock Manny out; we thought Manny was dead. Now, there are two schools of thought after something like that happens. Either … 1. That knockout (and all the ensuing adversity and doubt) actually made Manny stronger. And it wasn’t just the knockout; it was the devastating feeling of knowing that you had let your entire country down. I mean, Manny IS the Philippines. When he gets knocked out, that whole country gets knocked out. So he’s been forced to overcome so much more than the invincible-to-this-point Floyd ever did. He hit rock bottom, questioned himself, answered those questions and rallied back stronger than ever. No different from the Spurs after blowing the 2013 Finals, when they could have imploded and instead used that heartbreak as renewed motivation and determination for the following season. That’s the case for Manny bouncing back. The flip side … 2. You’re never the same after you get knocked the F out like that. You’re never the same. You’re NEVER the same. Here’s where I would love to be wrong: I believe in the second school of thought (not the first, which feels a little too media-created for me). I don’t see how having your brain get demolished to the point that it says “I’m shutting down for two solid minutes to regroup” is ever a good thing. And all the justifiable hatred/poison/disgust/contempt that’s being thrown Floyd’s way, as bizarre as this sounds, might have made Floyd stronger. He’s spent an entire career feeding off haters and rebelling against everything we ever wanted from a champion. He earned so much money that he actually nicknamed himself “Money.” He drinks Haterade like it’s bottled water. He thrives on booing and collective venom, and he loves the sound of a crowd that’s slowly giving up because he made them give up. By the time that first bell rings, Floyd will have worked himself into a defiant, me-against-the-world frenzy. Only it won’t be a frenzy, because that’s not how Floyd works. He uses outside forces to drive himself to a deeper performance level — improved concentration, deeper resolve, almost like he took Bradley Cooper’s special pill in Limitless. He goes to another level beyond the level beyond the level. He reaches the final stage of whatever fucked-up video game this is. He sees blows before they’re coming, bends in ways that shouldn’t be humanly possible, throws punches to set up punches that are coming eight punches later. He’s one of the best ever at hitting people while rarely, if ever, getting hit. And when he’s locked in, when he’s truly locked in, he cannot be beaten. It’s just about impossible. The best thing about being there on Saturday night? The chance that Manny might topple THAT. The worst thing about being there? Watching Floyd clinically dismantle Manny and slowly usurp all hope, round after round, as the crowd slowly settles into a disappointed realization that, you know, it’s watching the greatest fighter of his generation doing his thing, yet again, with all of his unlikable demons and indefensible baggage lingering over everything. If I had to bet my life on any Floyd-Manny scenario, it would be that one. Will the fight end up being as special as everyone hopes? Probably not. I hope I’m wrong. I hope Manny pulls off a semi-miracle. Yes, I will watch. No, I’m not going. I made my choice. Game 7. And by the way? I didn’t have a choice. My daughter turns 10 tomorrow. She’s already a master guilt-tripper and consistently ropes me into doing whatever she wants. It’s a dad-daughter thing and it’s impossible to explain; they just kind of own you from Day 1. I’m spending the entire day with her, then going to Game 7 … and only because she allowed me to do so. Yes, I’m daughter-whipped. I bring this up for a crucial reason: Every May, my daughter’s birthday party falls on an unbelievable sports day. The Derby, multiple playoff games, at least one Game 7, a big fight … I mean, year after year, the first Saturday in May becomes one of the three best sports days of the year. And I could have avoided this, year after year, had my wife and I done the math pre-pregnancy and aimed (no pun intended) for a better birthday. You know, like first week in March. Or late July. Maybe even the week before Super Bowl Week. Here’s the point: If you’re pulling the goalie and you’re a psycho about sports (and there are more of us out there than you’d think), don’t be afraid to get a little Gladwell/Outliers/Canadian Hockey Parent Weird and aim for a certain birthday range. You can get a little sports-fan selfish about it. It might work, it might not. But it doesn’t have to be a totally random event. Also, we never had this conversation. But that’s how I came to pick Game 7 (and my daughter, kind of) over The Big Fight. Time to rip through some NBA emails. As always, these are actual emails from actual readers. Q: You’ve repeatedly referred to Kawhi Leonard as either a shark or having octopus arms. Can we just call him Sharktopus and be done with it? He could definitely star in a bad SyFY movie where he scours the world’s basketball courts praying on unsuspecting dribblers.
—Jackson D., Trumbull, CT BS: We needed a way to describe those three-minute stretches when Kawhi shifts into All-Madden mode, grows six extra arms, then starts prowling midcourt like a great white looking for shaky ball handlers who mistakenly swam away from their pack. He does everything but throw a shark fin on his back — no different from Pippen and MJ abusing terrified ball handlers on the ’96 Bulls. (That’s the greatest YouTube montage that nobody’s made yet.) But I’d rather name the event itself something like “Sharktopus Mode” over pushing it as someone’s nickname. Do you really need a nickname if you already have a unique first name? Kobe, Kyrie, LeBron, Kawhi, Dirk, Steph, Shaq, Kanye, Oprah, Rembert … what’s the point? Cari Van Der Yacht Q: I think I’ve finally landed on who/what I’m reminded of when I watch Steph Curry … the blossoming of young Gretzky! Improbable physical stature (or lack thereof), savant-like awareness and vision, making the whole greater than the sum of the parts, and the big moment production. What say you?
—Greg, Renton, WA BS: Like the thinking and love that you went cross-sport AND cross-racial for a Curry-Gretzky comparison. Very well done. But man … Gretzky??? Q: During G-State/New Orleans, my son said to me, “You know who Curry is? Gretzky.” And we realized that Warriors/Oilers parallels worked all the way down the roster. Draymond Green? Mark Messier. Klay Thompson? Jari Kurri. Andrew Bogut? Grant Fuhr. You can even make a case for Andre Iguodala and Craig MacTavish.  I just can’t think of anyone Curry reminds me of more than the Great One. Skinny. Not a great athlete. And a genius.
—Eric S., Provo BS: Now you have me thinking. (And … I’m done.) Can’t we just go with Maravich crossed with Nash? Do we have to bring the best hockey forward ever into this? By the time Gretzky turned 27 (Curry’s age now), he’d already won three Cups and eight straight Hart Trophies (EIGHT!!!) and broken every conceivable NHL scoring record. Gretzky was so good that, when someone nicknamed him “The Great One,” it actually stuck as his nickname. Do you realize how great you have to be at playing sports to earn and keep a nickname like “Magic” or “The Great One”? If Curry wins the title, does Maravich/Nash things, topples LeBron and finishes something like 16-3 or 16-4 in the 2015 playoffs, even THEN I’m not ready to have this discussion. Let’s just say “He’s a little Gretzky-ish at times” and be done with it. Q: Perfect nickname for Steph Curry: Stephen F. Curry, or simply S.F.C. Inspiration came from Stephen F. Austin (SFA), although the ‘F’ in the two stand for very different things. I know nicknames are supposed to be shorter, but it’s STEPHEN FUCKING CURRY!!!!!!!!
—Casey Anderson, Marshall, MN BS: I love this for so many reasons, but mainly because it doesn’t presume all-time greatness like “The Great One,” “The Greatest” or “Magic.” It’s just pure excitement — an expletive and exclamation points. And it has a great acronym. S.F.C.! I don’t think Steph needs a nickname, but that’s pretty good. Q: Regarding your mailbag question on the most appropriate name for the Ben Simmons tanking process over here, a great guy is known to be a ‘top bloke.” Why not call the Ben Simmons tanking process “Choke for the Top Bloke?”
—Jono Adelaide, Australia BS: Not bad. Last Friday, I asked the readers to see if they could top “Lossie for the Aussie” or “Skimmin’ for Simmons.” My favorite runner-up suggestions: Blunder for Down Under, Poo for a Kangaroo, Bend Down for Ben, DeRailin’ for the Australian and Pulled Asunder for Down Under. Here was the meanest suggestion: Q: Couldn’t you just call it: Pulling a Simmons for Simmons?  I mean, I pretty sure the 76ers won more games than you wrote columns during the 14/15 season…
—Blair S., S.F. BS: Words hurt. The truth hurts even more. But here’s our winner: Q: Wouldn’t the obvious candidate be “B.S. for B.S.?”
—Alex, Manhattan, KS BS: “B.S. for B.S.!” That’s right … B.S. for “B.S. for B.S.”! Anyway, I’m putting Blunder for Down Under and B.S. for B.S. in the Ben Simmons 2016 Tankapalooza Catchphrase Finals. I need more time to marinate on this. After all, we are talking about a franchise forward with the exact same name as my only son and who just so happens to be entering the same draft lottery in which my favorite team has its own pick, Brooklyn’s pick (UNPROTECTED!) and Dallas’s pick (top-seven protected — and yeah, that team is Year 18 Dirk, Knee Surgery Parsons and Just About Nobody Else right now). This is too important. I need more time. Also in last week’s mailbag, I gave everyone one week to top “James Dolan, disaster expert” in a new game called “Find someone who has the exact same name as a celebrity, but also has a ridiculous job that somehow ties into how ridiculous the celebrity is.” Of course, nobody could top it because how the hell was anyone ever topping “James Dolan, disaster expert”? But I did enjoy these beauties. Dr. Alex Rodriguez, pharmacy technician … Josh Smith, bricklayer … Justin M. Bieber, ESQ … Jon Goodman, personal trainer … Dr. Randy Wittman, gynecologist … David Stern, foreclosure king … and David Kahn, fraud specialist lawyer1 Now, some might say I cheated by not including the other Bill Simmons — a.k.a. “El Wingador,” the renowned chicken wing eating champion who went to jail for cocaine trafficking. But I’ve been in the same room with cocaine only once in my life — during Game 7, 2004 ALCS, the bathroom of an undisclosed Boston bar, when I had gone in there to pee and inadvertently walked in on two guys snorting lines off the bathroom sink. (In their defense, the Red Sox were trying to come back from 3-0 and there were no laws in Boston that night.) It’s true: Lenny Bias blew three to four Celtics titles, but he also ruined any chance of me ever trying cocaine. That raises a separate mailbag question (I’ll save you the energy): Would I rather have those three to four titles and maybe four to five extra Bird-McHale years (since Bias would have extended their careers) even if it meant there would have been a good chance I’d have at least tried cocaine in college (and then who knows?) … or would I rather keep things the way they were? And the answer, obviously, is OF COURSE I WOULD HAVE WANTED THE EXTRA TITLES AND THE EXTRA BIRD-MCHALE YEARS!!! ARE YOU CRAZY??????? Oh screw it, I’m going to hell anyway.  Q: Have you noticed that every time CP gets called for a personal, he looks like a toddler who just lost his favorite toy? It’s unbelievable.
—Tyler, Fremont, Nebraska BS: Not in Game 6! It was the new and improved, referee-friendly, non-stomping, non-eyeballing, taking-care-of-business CP! We’ll see if it was an aberration. The Clippers can’t beat San Antonio when they’re worried about the refs for three straight hours. Just play basketball, for God’s sake. As a Los Angeles reader named Ryan points out, it’s not a coincidence that they ended up with someone nicknamed “Big Baby” on this team. They blew Game 5 because they lost their poise, rode the refs relentlessly and inspired their formerly-beaten-down-but-endearing fans to do more play-to-play bitching than any crowd I’ve ever seen. It was like a basketball whirlpool of excuse-making, sarcastic grinning, disgusted hand-throwing, eyeballing, stomping and yelping. And it really hurt them. You can’t do that crap against the Spurs. I want to see the mentally tough Game 6 Clips in Game 7. If the mentally weak Game 5 Clips show up, they’re done. Q: Kia commercial idea: Doc Rivers forces Blake Griffin to drive his new Kia 220,000 miles. Car predictably breaks down on the highway, leading Doc to complain loudly about the quality of the California roads.
—Alex H, Baltimore BS: Come on, come on. They’re trying. Game 6 was a big step forward. Q: In your podcast, Haralabob’s Scrabble analogy with the Clippers was amazing. CP3 is a Q (starts it off), Blake is a Z (excellent finisher) and they just can’t seem to figure out how to find a U and an I (DeAndre certainly isn’t either). We’re all waiting for them to keep dropping a triple word “Quiz” in a big game and it it’s not happening. What’s worse? With those two letters (Paul and Blake) it’s so obvious they’re just going for that one word; over and over and over again. Meanwhile the Spurs are getting creative with all kinds of words and letters; they’ve got some 4 point Fs, some 3 point Cs, a few five point Ks, and that desperate U the Clips need to solve the “Quiz” dilemma.
—Sam, Los Angeles BS: That’s your best-case scenario for Saturday night, right? The Clips leading by three in the final five minutes, then ripping the Spurs to shreds with CP3-Blake screen-and-rolls to finish it off for their first 66-point Scrabble score. For the record, I was crazy jealous of Bob’s fantastic Scrabble analogy. So good. It’s the eternal dilemma of every NBA contender that has two elite players but can’t figure out how to build around them. Even better, it’s fun to think of different NBA GMs looking at their Scrabble tiles right now. Billy King: “I have all 1-point letters, all the big-score letters are gone, all the blanks are gone, I’m down 100 points, and I gave away my next three turns to the Celtics … but we can do this!!!!!” Phil Jackson: “Wait … how many tiles do you get each turn again? And how do the points work? Hold on, where am I?” Vlade Divac: “Vivek, what word do you want me to spell?” Sam Presti: “Everything is fine! Everything is fine! I don’t even want to know how many tiles are left, and I don’t want to think about the triple-word score that I missed 10 turns ago because I got too cute and tried to set up a use-all-my-tiles 50-pointer and inadvertently screwed it up. I’ve gotten the Q, the Z, 4 S tiles and both blanks and I still might lose! It’s OK! I can rally! Everything is fine!” Q: Can we start referring to Steve Ballmer as “Mark Cueball”? 
—Tyler, El Segundo BS: No. Q: Like ‘Playoff Rondo’ (RIP), can we make ‘Playoff Wittman’ a thing?
—Roberto, San Juan, PR BS: Of course! Playoff Wittman: the guy who belatedly embraced things like “3s over long 2s,” “Otto Porter’s young legs” and “Paul Pierce as a stretch 4 opening up the paint for Wall and Beal.” As my buddy House (a D.C. diehard) says, Regular-Season Wittman plays checkers and Playoff Wittman plays chess. Was Playoff Wittman playing possum for the past six months? Was he hibernating? Did the Internet break him down and coach him up? I just know that a Wiz-Cavs Eastern finals is looking ludicrously realistic. Needless to say, the Wiz own my 2015 playoff heart because of Paul Pierce; it’s like lending one of your favorite uncles to someone else’s holiday dinner table. You’re gonna love him, he’s hilarious! He makes every dinner better! Q: You always talk about Rondo being a 90-10 guy, is he now a 10-90 guy?
—Elie, Los Angeles BS: It’s not that bad. He’s a 50/50 guy now — you love 50 percent of the stuff he does and you hate the other 50 percent. How ’bout the Mavs stiffing Rondo on his 2015 playoff share? Is there a better way to show your contempt for a teammate than stiffing him on his playoff share? I love sports sometimes. I wish ESPN voted on playoff shares every year. I would totall— AHHHHHHHHHHHHH! I’M GETTING ELECTROSHOCKED!!! AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!! —Joe House, Washington, D.C. BS: Yup, these are my friends. Q: I believe that Tim Duncan can go on playing at this level for a few more years. But instead of retiring, why not follow the trail that The Undertaker is currently blazing? What if he stayed in shape, but only played a few regular season games per year to stay sharp, then saved himself for 20-25 playoff games (i.e. WrestleMania). Couldn’t he extend his career by another five years by doing this? This is a win/win situation for all!
—Chris F, Port Colborne, ON, Canada BS: I love everything about this. First, the Undertaker has defied the aging process and extended his prime for reasons that have never really been explained … kind of like Tim Duncan. Second, the Undertaker’s 21-0 WrestleMania streak was wrestling’s equivalent to Duncan being the best big man on Finals winners 15 years apart and/or making All-NBA teams 18 years apart2 and/or averaging 21 and 12 for his first 17 years of playoff games and 16 and 11 in Year 18 of the playoffs. Third, neither of them say much and spend a ton of time looking around with a weird look on their faces. Fourth, Undertaker was the behind-the-scenes leader of WWE’s locker room for years and years and was loved by everyone who worked with him (like Duncan with the Spurs). And fifth, if anyone could successfully pull off the NBA’s version of “Just show up for WrestleMania and we’re good,” wouldn’t it be the Spurs? OK, so what if Duncan were to retire this summer … and the Spurs use their available cap space to sign, say, LaMarcus Aldridge … and then Duncan “miraculously” un-retires on April 1 and comes back Undertaker-style for three months? And he just keeps doing this until he turns 45? There’s probably some dumb salary-cap rule that rooster-blocks this idea, but screw it — let’s fix the cap. I WANT 25 YEARS OF UNDERTAKER DUNCAN!!!!!  Q: Does no one care that Lamarcus Aldridge shot 33% against Memphis in Round One? I know Z-Bo and Big Spain are tough, but that’s not exactly the performance you want going into free agency.
—Kevin Linger, Arlington, VA BS: Yes and no and yes and no. Yes because it’s never good for someone to bomb in the playoffs right before he hunts for a max deal; he was like a Bizarro Jerome James. No because Aldridge wasn’t leaving Portland unless Round 1 went badly. Yes because that series proved something we already knew: Aldridge is a star, but he’s not a superstar. (You’re not a title contender just because he showed up. But in a 2008 Celtics-type scenario, where he’s one of three All-Stars, that’s different. So you’re one-third of the way there with him.) And no because part of me always wonders if, when someone knows they’re probably leaving a franchise, the ensuing guilt inadvertently affects their performance on the way out the door. Think LeBron in 2010. Just a theory. I can only tell you that the Aldridge in that Memphis series didn’t totally look like the Aldridge we’ve been watching these past two seasons. And it had to go a little deeper than “Z-Bo knows all his moves.” Q: Is Dame Lillard now the favorite for the 2015/16 ‘Shamed By the Internet to Become a Decent Defender Award’? (current holder: Harden)
—Alfie, London BS: No question whatsoever. I call these players “Internet Victims” — when a steady torrent of abuse inadvertently makes them better and shames them into improving their deficiencies. Your 2014 Internet Victim MVP: Rudy Gay. 2015: James Harden. And 2016: Dame Lillard. Lock it down. Right now, he’s a basketball DH. Q: Save this email, because I’m calling it right now: Myles Turner is going to be an NBA superstar. In three years, when he’s first-team All-NBA and carrying the Cs with Smart and Thomas to the Finals, you can run this email and say “Man, that guy nailed it.”
—Tito Crafts, Northampton, MA BS: I’ll do you one better: I will run that email and say, “Man, Tito Crafts nailed it.” I’ll throw in italics and everything. Q: In your 2007 MVP Column you wrote this about Tim Duncan: “After 850 regular-season and playoff games, three 100-game seasons and more than 32,000 minutes logged on his odometer, he’s not the player he was five years ago. But you know what? In a weird way, he’s just as effective. He’s a smarter defender and a much better leader, he knows how to pick his spots, he’s insanely competitive and one of the most unexpectedly entertaining players to see in person for anyone who gives a crap about basketball. Nobody communicates with his teammates as well, nobody commands more respect, and there’s never a second when you forget he’s out there. There’s not another player in the league quite like him.” That was eight years ago! How is this happening?!?
—Doug W., Cedar Falls, IA BS: I mean …  Q: You wrote in your most recent mailbag regarding the playoff LVP: “Cleveland’s crowd (did you ever think Miami would have given LeBron a better playoff atmosphere than Cleveland????)” Well… can you blame us? I’ve been through three decades as a Cleveland sports fan, having one lesson drilled into me- hope is just a setup to make the kick to the groin that much worse.  We use shorthand code for all of the sports tragedies we’ve endured- “Red Right 88”, “The Drive”, “The Fumble”.  The best coach in the NFL couldn’t win here.  The NFL team couldn’t win the Super Bowl until they left town. At this point, I as a Cleveland fan is nothing but raw bruises, flinching at every moment.  I fully expect Kyrie to get injured, Love to leave town,  and LeBron to take the team to Baltimore. As much as I want to embrace this team- and it’s a fun team- I keep waiting for disaster to strike.
—Mike, Cleveland BS: Did I get that email about 24 hours before Father Kelly Olynyk ripped Love’s shoulder out of its socket? Yes. Yes I did. By the way, I’ve been watching Father Kelly for two years; he’s a clumsy, uncoordinated, way-too-nice, laid-back Canadian who sucks at boxing out and had just heard his coach scream at his entire team about not giving up offensive rebounds. I believe it was a fluke. Then again, I’m the same guy who still believes Bernard Karmell Pollard should serve prison time, so I’m probably not an unbiased observer here. Q: Did the Celtics just lose whatever (admittedly small) chance they had of signing Kevin Love this summer when Olynyk dislocated Love’s shoulder? 
—Josh, Boston BS: Are you kidding? If Love holds any real bitterness, we’ll waive Father Kelly tomorrow! We’ll strip his clothes, force him to walk from Charlestown to the South End wearing an “I’m sorry, Kevin” sign. We’ll get him to cut his haircut just like Kevin Love and become the Damien Mizdow to Love’s The Miz. We’ll turn Father Kelly into Love’s personal chef, chauffeur and pot wrangler. Whatever he wants. Father Kelly ain’t standing between Boston and Kevin Love. The reason he didn’t intentionally hurt Love doubles as the reason he’s expendable: Again, he’s a clumsy, uncoordinated, way-too-nice, laid-back Canadian who sucks at boxing out (and can’t protect the rim). Could he become a stretch big off the bench for a contender? Sure! But you don’t throw away a chance at Kevin Love for it. (You know why I know Love would be good in Brad Stevens’s system as a stretch 4 who bangs the boards? Because Jared Sullinger, Gigi Datome and Father Kelly all had their moments in that system … and he’s way way way better than any of them. FORGIVE US, KEVIN LOVE! NO HARD FEELINGS!) Q: After Wade blatantly destroyed Rondo’s elbow in the 2011 playoffs and the Miami Lebrons ended Boston’s season, isn’t it fitting that Father Kelly may have finished off the Cleveland LeBrons four years later? It might be my Celtics bias, but I believe Father Kelly received a vision from the basketball gods.
—Daniel, Champaign, IL BS: And on a Sunday, no less. Q: I didn’t think there could be a more perfect nemesis for Cleveland than Joakim Noah … what with his bad words about our beloved lame city and his ugly yelling face. But Olynyk has the opportunity among Cleveland to supplant Noah as “Opponent That Makes Us Most Eager To Defecate On Their Face.”
—Adam K., Lakewood BS: That would be the best ESPYS category ever. Q: It’s not like we need any more proof that God hates Cleveland, but doesn’t Olynyk bear a striking resemblance to Jesus? God isn’t even trying to hide it at this point.
—Mike, Chicago BS: I’m starting to feel bad. Can I cheer the Cleveland fans up for a second? Your team turned Love into a glorified role player. It’s LeBron’s team and Kyrie’s team — everyone else either spreads the floor, plays defense, crashes the boards or shoots open 3s. You can lose your THIRD-best player and still win the title. Losing Love means less lineup flexibility, less margin for error, more predictability and more of LeBron at the 4 (playing power guard). It also means more Mike Miller, James Jones and Shawn Marion; along with Kendrick Perkins, they could star in a Costacos Brothers poster called “The Cleveland Cadaverliers.” But I still like their crunch-time five — LeBron, Kyrie, Shumpert, J.R. Smith and either Thompson or Mozgov (depending on matchups). It’s not over. Right? Q: Reporter: “Kelly, why did you take Kevin out?” Olynyk: “Because God hates Cleveland, and I am His instrument. LeBron would have been too obvious.”
—PG, Naperville, IL BS: I give up. Q: Hey Bill, I’ve been to many Cavs games as my parents had season tickets pre-Decision. I hate to admit it — you may be right about the dull crowd! I offer two explanations. First, season tickets sold out in 2.5 seconds (my parents dropped their tix year two after the jilt and couldn’t get them back this summer) meaning the crowd is mostly bandwagon jumpers who don’t know how to cheer. The old crowd grew with LBJ and were thrilled to be relevant. That’s one theory. The second is difficult to explain. Say you went through a terrible breakup with the girl you thought you would marry. Being a loser, you took her back a few years later with open arms. Your friends already moved on, got married and had kids all while you moped around in your underwear for four years. Now, you have all those other Ds she encountered in the back of your mind knowing full well that all you encountered was your lady five fingers. So, when you’re out on your date at the game she and your friends always ask “you OK?” and of course your response is “Huh? Oh yeah, all good.” You know — it’s great to be back getting that action! But there’s no way you can clear your mind of those shitty four years! So Cavs fans have the breakup reunion hangover where you can’t quite put 100% of your emotion into it yet because your brain won’t let you! After all, you still keep the lotion and tissues in your bedside drawer just in case.

189,The Tim Duncan Question,"When my father retired as a school superintendent in 2009, only a few months before his 62nd birthday, I remember friends and family members being surprised that he didn’t stay longer. “You always want to get out a year early, not one or two years too late,” my dad always explained. At the time, I thought this was exceptionally astute. Now I realize it was code for Instead of dealing with the 24/7 fear of hormonal teenagers acting inappropriately during the age of cell phone videos, Twitter, Internet anonymity and whatever else is coming, I’d much rather just go to matinee movies, watch sports and fall asleep on the sofa every night. But at the time? I thought my father was a modern-day Confucius. You always want to get out a year early, not one or two years too late. It’s totally true. And if that’s true … what do we do about Tim Duncan? The NBA’s real-life Undertaker just got bounced from the playoffs in an unusually excruciating way, falling two points shy in one of the best Game 7s ever. Maybe Saturday’s Clippers defeat wasn’t as gut-wrenching as San Antonio’s improbable 2013 Finals collapse, but Duncan’s murky future gave Game 7 a different kind of desperation. He scored 27 points, grabbed 11 rebounds, drained two game-tying, über-clutch free throws with eight seconds to play … and missed blocking Chris Paul’s last-second, double-clutch, series-winning banker by the length of maybe two knuckles. Ten years ago, he absolutely would have blocked that shot. Five years ago, he probably would have blocked it. In May of 2015, at age 39, playing on one leg — with 18 seasons, 1,572 games and nearly 55,000 minutes on his NBA odometer — Tim Duncan couldn’t quite get there. Was that the last play of his career? Duncan isn’t saying yet. Of the 14 greatest NBA players ever — Jordan, then Russell, then Kareem, then Bird and Magic and Duncan and LeBron, then Wilt and Kobe, then West and Oscar, then Hakeem and Shaq and Moses — 10 of the 14 retired at least one or two years too late.1 As soon as Kobe retires, he’ll become the 11th. LeBron doesn’t count yet. So only the great Bill Russell definitely got out early — he dropped the mic after winning back-to-back titles and beating Wilt, West AND Elgin. And then he hugged his teammates, sprayed some champagne, gave one of my favorite postgame interviews ever …  … and just like that, Bill Russell walked away. So those are the stakes for Tim Duncan. Leave right now. Leave everyone wanting more. Leave people saying, “Keep playing! You’re still good at this!” Leave with your legs still working. (Fine, one of your legs.) Leave knowing that, by any calculation, you were one of the best two-way players ever and one of the most beloved teammates ever. Leave with five titles, two MVPs and an astonishing 15 All-NBA team nods.2 Leave as someone who averaged 21 and 12 with 50 percent shooting and a 24.6 PER in 234 playoff games from 1998 through 2014 … and then 18 and 11 with 59 percent shooting and a 24.0 PER in your final playoff series.3 Leave behind an astoundingly efficient Year 1 through Year 18 stretch that only Kareem and Karl Malone can match. Leave after barely losing a historically great series. Leave after your normally gruff coach said this about you … More 2015 NBA Playoffs Check out all of our postseason coverage! “I continue to be amazed by Tim Duncan. He was our most consistent player in the playoffs, at 39. He needed a little more help and I feel badly he didn’t get it. It wasn’t for lack of trying. Even our players shake their heads at his performance at both ends of the floor. He wants it badly and does it the right way. It’s not about bells and whistles and grunting and dancing and doing commercials and all of that stuff. He just does it quietly and that’s why we feel badly when we don’t get it done for him.” That’s why we feel badly when we don’t get it done for him. Eighteen years and they’re still saying this about Timmaaay??? What if he’s leaving two years early? What if he has one more vintage beauty in him? Before he decides, I really hope he watches the last 12 minutes and 10 seconds of Game 7 again. Maybe it will get his juices flowing. Here’s a retro diary to help fill in the blanks. 0:10 remaining, third quarter (Clips 76, Spurs 76) With Chris Paul resting on the bench, the Clips just “blew” a four-point lead (three missed 3s, one turnover) and have a foul to give … Manu Ginobili knows it … only Austin Rivers doesn’t realize that Manu knows it … leading to the rarely seen “fouled in the act of shooting a 3 from 65 feet away” call … leading to the incredible sight of Rivers and his son executing matching disbelief/sprint/stomp skids.4 Double Rivers! It’s like a Double Rainbow for demonstrative NBA frown fests. Have we peaked with bitching at referees? I think we’ve peaked. Of course, they were right — bogus call. But that became my favorite Austin Rivers/Game 7 moment other than one ugly second-quarter miss prompting a grizzled Clips fan in my row to snarl in disgust, “Jesus, I’d rather have Chris on one leg out there than Doc’s son.” You know who else felt that way? Doc Rivers! Anyway, Manu makes two of three. And just when you thought San Antonio had the momentum … 0:00 remaining, third quarter (Clips 79, Spurs 78) Paul comes back, dribbles over midcourt, takes three steps (no travel call — a pseudo-makeup), banks in a 37-footer and immediately stares down referee Monty McCutchen for the NBA’s first-ever one-legged, double-clutch, 37-foot F.U. banker. Double Rivers, Double Momentum Swing! For once, an appallingly bad call didn’t derail the Clippers, it rerailed them. 11:30 remaining, fourth quarter (Spurs up 81-79) Patty Mills drains a 3 as 18,000 Clips fans inside Staples Center mutter, I really hope Pop doesn’t realize that he should play Mills over Parker in crunch time. Yet another reason why Duncan should retire: Tony Parker might not be Tony Parker anymore. Check out these playoff numbers … 2013: 36.4 mpg, 20.6 ppg, 7.0 apg, 45.8% FG, 5.3 FTA, 21.5 PER 2014: 31.3 mpg, 17.4 ppg, 4.8 apg, 48.6% FG, 3.0 FTA, 15.8 PER 2015: 30.0 mpg, 10.9 ppg, 3.6 apg, 36.3% FG, 2.4 FTA, 6.3 PER Yeeesh. It’s hard to run a slash-and-kick offense when your point guard can’t slash or kick.5 Even if an Achilles strain hampered Parker, isn’t that the problem with aging point guards? It’s always something, right? With 1,008 regular-season games and 203 playoff games behind him, how is this situation getting better? Or could you blame San Antonio’s grueling 2012-14 run — Western finals, Finals, Finals — for Parker’s body wearing down? Right now, Duncan is doing laps in some Caribbean pool and asking himself these very questions. (Thinking.) You’re right, he’s definitely not thinking about this. 11:04 (Clips 82-81) Three-pointer, Chris Paul. Quick tangent … In 1976, I was there when a thoroughly banged-up John Havlicek made his famous off-one-leg running banker in the triple-OT game against Phoenix. I watched Kevin McHale play on a broken foot for four straight rounds in ’87. I watched Larry Legend submit multiple Hardwood Classics moments in ’91 and ’92 while wearing a disturbingly bulky back brace. I watched a gimpy Wade throw on his Batman costume and help out Superman LeBron in those last two 2013 Finals games. But watching Chris Paul’s trial-and-error routine with that faulty hamstring, once he returned to Game 7 Saturday, ranks right up there. He just wouldn’t let that thing derail him. One time in the fourth quarter, Paul pushed it too far, instinctively pulled up and grabbed the back of his leg, fought it off and kept hopping around. You could see him shifting into De Niro/Midnight Run mode … No way … no way … I’ve come too far … I’ve come too fucking far …  These guys happen to be otherworldly athletes; that’s why we watch. They make our dreams come true. But sometimes, adversity pulls something magical from them — maybe their body breaks down, maybe they feel the game slipping away, maybe the teams are uneven, whatever. And they just ascend to a different place. You can actually see it. It’s incredible to watch. I have been going to Clippers games for four years; that was easily the best game I’ve ever seen Chris Paul play. It was like watching someone win a NASCAR race with three tires. He had no margin for error. None. And here was the best thing about it: Everyone has to shut the heck up now. Shelve the “never made the conference finals” argument. Shelve the “never came up huge when it mattered” hot take. Chris Paul just played an all-time game in an all-time series. And won. And it happened on the heels of him submitting the best seven-year stretch in point guard history — nobody has ever remained this efficient on both ends for this long. It’s simply never happened. He’s the best point guard of his generation. Game 7 ended up being his submission to the “Best Point Guards Ever” club — his version of Isiah’s slightly-more-incredible Game 6 of the 1988 Finals. A game that I absolutely revere even though a Bad Boy Piston was involved. Last point: After seeing how badly CP3 wanted Saturday’s game, it was fascinating to watch how badly Floyd and Manny didn’t want their fight. They made an exceptionally lucrative arrangement to stage a friendly 12-round boxing exhibition, our first-ever Happy To Be There fight of the century. This was the good-natured, hate-free, low-stakes battle that Drago and Creed were supposed to have had.6 When Manny fell behind heading into the last four rounds, you never felt his urgency — because he didn’t have any. That dude had both arms raised from the moment they told him how much money he was making. Game 7 wasn’t the best undercard for Floyd and Manny, that’s for sure. They made the Williams sisters look like fierce rivals. Anyway … 10:06 (Clips 84-84) Missed Kawhi 3, Diaw rebound, Manu 3 (good!), Griffin turnover, Spurs fast break … and Kawhi blows a twisting reverse layup that leads to a Matt Barnes dunk. I didn’t love Kawhi’s last two games — no-showed Game 6, never went full Sharktopus in Game 7. Does he trust his own talent yet? Couldn’t he have beaten any Clipper off the dribble whenever he wanted? Why did it seem like he wasn’t ready to be The Guy? That series stuck him one notch below the league’s best — LeBron, Curry, Harden, Westbrook, Durant, Griffin and Paul — because none of those seven guys would have just one signature A-game in a truly special seven-game series. On the bright side, of everyone I just mentioned, only LeBron and Kawhi have Finals MVPs. I don’t have a feel for this one yet. To be continued.7 8:27 (Clips 88-87) More back-and-forth action crests with CP3 hitting a jumper, Duncan abusing DeAndre on the low post (he’s officially in Game 6 2013 Finals Jedi mode), then Blake pulling off a reverse layup for a three-point play (“hrrrrrrr-HAHHHHHHHH”). When it’s the right Game 7, something of a survival instinct kicks in — step up your game or else. That happened in the best two Game 7s I ever caught in person: 1981 Boston-Philly and 1987 Boston-Detroit. Everyone just kept climbing the ladder as the fans glanced around in disbelief. This was the exact point in Saturday’s game when it started happening — right here. (You’re gonna miss those moments, Timmay.) 6:43 (Spurs 92-91) Kawhi short-arms a jumper but grabs the rebound, leading to another Manu 3. (If this was Manu’s final game, let the record show that his last two baskets were made 3s.) Then Jamal Crawford throws the ball away and fouls Parker. Let the record show that Crawford scored nine crucial points during the game’s darkest stretch for Clips fans, which can be described in collective quotes like this … “That’s weird, why is Chris coming out so soon? Two minutes left in the first quarter? He just made a 3! We don’t have a bench!!!! It’s Game 7!!!!!!” “Um … why did Chris just limp off to the locker room?” “I’m ignoring the next 10 minutes as I text everyone I know and frantically refresh Twitter over and over again.” “Nice shot, Jamal! WHY ISN’T ANYONE TEXTING ME BACK????” “Ballmer paid $2 billion and he couldn’t give us decent Wi-Fi? WHERE IS CHRIS PAUL???” “OUR SEASON IS GONNA COME DOWN TO DOC’S FUCKING SON!!!! OF COURSE! OF COURSE IT IS! THIS IS THE MOST CLIPPERS-Y MOMENT EVER!!!!!!!!!” “AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!” “Hamstring Hamstring Hamstring Hamstring Hamstring Hamstring Hamstring Hamstring … ” “Hamstring Hamstring Hamstring Hamstring Hamstring Hamstring Hamstring Hamstring … ” “Hey — there’s Chris! He’s back! “Is he … (holding breath … )” “HERE COMES WILLIS!!!!! ER — CHRIS!!!!!!!! And we’re only down one!!!!!!” So yeah, Jamal might have stunk in Round 1 — 11.7 points, 38 percent shooting, 20 percent from 3 and a ghastly 8.86 PER. But those nine no-CP3 points were nine of the biggest points of his career. The Clips don’t win Game 7 without them. 6:09 (Spurs 95-91) After misses from Kawhi and Crawford, Danny Green makes a driving layup for a three-point play. Timeout, Clippers. From the 1:51 mark of the third quarter until right now, neither team led by more than TWO points. That’s nearly eight minutes of game time in all. Oh, and the final average score of this series was Spurs 103.4, Clippers 103.0. (Translation: Had this been a 49-game series, it would have come down to the last minute of Game 49.) 5:58 (Spurs 95-92) Good God, it’s Hack-A-DJ!!!!!! He makes only one of two. Can you really give DeAndre Jordan a $120 million, five-year extension when he’s become such a free throw liability that he’s headed for a Game 7 crunch-time benching? We’ll have to ask this guy …  (You’re right, DJ is probably getting that $120 million.) 5:26 (Spurs 97-94) Duncan scores and CP3 bricks an 18-footer, leading to the game’s second Coulda Woulda Shoulda momentum swing play8 — Parker grabbed the rebound, only he forgot that Chris Paul loves sneak-picking pockets after missed Clippers shots. Whoops. Pop flipped out after this one. Not protecting a big defensive rebound against Chris Paul — that’s like not moving the leftover pork chops far enough away from the counter if you have a dog. Huge mistake. Parker quickly fouls Griffin, who makes both free throws. Coulda woulda shoulda. 5:26 (Spurs 97-94) Barnes comes in for DeAndre. Hold this thought. 4:58 (Clips 97, Spurs 97) Kawhi barely misses another runner in traffic (partly because of splendid defense by Griffin), followed by J.J. Redick finally arriving for Game 7 by nailing a monster 3. (Welcome to the game, J.J.!) We went from “up five with the ball” to “tie game” in like 10 nanoseconds. Timeout, Spurs. 4:00 (Spurs 101-100) Diaw to Duncan inside for a layup, Redick’s second straight 3 (off a nice pick from Blake), Parker with an off-balance banker. Boom, boom, boom. Dizzying. Such a high level of hoops. And the subtweet conversation of this epic run … no DeAndre! Doc willingly sacrificed rim protection and defensive rebounding to spread the floor and avoid the Seventh Circle of Hell (a.k.a. Game 7 Crunch-Time Hack-A-DJ). Say what you want about Doc, but this decision took a set of watermelon-size balls. I loved it. 3:34 (Clips 102-101) Danny Green fouls a driving/careering/fearless Blake and Griffin drains both. He’d finish with a 24-13-10, including 10 of 11 from the charity stripe, in what can only be described as “A Full Realization Of Everything I Ever Wanted From Blake Griffin.” He played brilliantly all series, but in the final two games, he put together the mental parts, too. Specifically, don’t overreact to hard fouls, don’t react to every call like someone is towing your car, keep your head down, keep pounding the basket and play your heart out. How many times was Blake gasping for air on the bench like he’d just finished a triathlon? Nobody played harder. He finally figured it out. Great power forwards aren’t that complicated — once they hit their playoff peaks, they start going for 24 and 12 every night and that’s just how it goes. Look up Malone, Barkley, Pettit, Duncan, C-Webb, Garnett, Elgin … it doesn’t matter. Those guys were getting 24 and 12 at their peaks. Blake took it up a notch: For the series, he sent in his 42 Club application by averaging 24, 13 and 7, with a 26.0 PER, which has never been done for an entire NBA postseason. By anyone. Only four players ever averaged 24, 12 and 5 with a 24 PER in the playoffs: Duncan (twice), Garnett (three times), Oscar (once) and Blake so far. And throwing out the stats, Blake just wanted it in that Game 7. Lost in the celebration of Paul’s game-winning shot was a frightening image: Griffin watching the play unfold, taking off from the foul line and launching toward the basket for what would have unquestionably been the greatest and most memorable follow-up dunk of all time … only the shot went in and Griffin’s lower half collided with Manu Ginobili …  … which nearly broke his neck, but whatever. Blake didn’t care what happened to him — he was dunking that putback even if it killed him. I loved it. Maybe it IS time for Duncan to get out. Like winter in Game of Thrones, Blake Griffin is coming.9 (And Anthony Davis, too.) 2:50 (Spurs 103-102) Diaw misses a 5-footer, Barnes blocks two Green putbacks (TWO!), then Duncan makes a layup AND gets fouled by Griffin, followed by the textbook Duncan/Undertaker dead-eyed shuffle/stomp-away/eye-bulge routine toward the sideline as his bench erupts. Just a stupefyingly competitive sequence that doubles as DeAndre’s best case for a $120 million extension, even before Duncan misses the free throw, Diaw grabs the rebound (PAY DEANDRE!!!!!), and eventually, Parker gets a wide-open 3 and misses it. And just when Spurs fans feel themselves starting to grumble, “Put in Patty Mills!!!!” … 2:47 (Spurs 105-102) Rebound, Kawhi. Putback, Kawhi. Possible Leap brewing?10 2:25 (Spurs 105-102) Our third Coulda Woulda Shoulda play starts with CP3 missing a jump shot short, then Parker bolting on a fast break with only Redick back. Parker pulls up for a split second … but it’s a ploy! Stutter step! Now he’s challenging Redick (and why not???) with the patented Parker 5-foot floater … only it doesn’t fall! How did that not go in? How the hell did that not go in??? (And as I’m thinking that, we’re already going back the other way, and Barnes is open for 3 … ) 2:12 (Spurs 105, Clips 105) In the words of Mike Breen, “Bang!!!!!!!!!!” Not since Robert Horry’s heyday has such a statistically shaky, up-and-down, pseudo-journeyman doubled as such a valuable you-can-go-to-war-with-him playoff guy. He made six or seven huge fourth-quarter plays and vindicated Doc’s decision to bench DeAndre. Of anyone who’s ever been married to a real-life reality show character, Barnes is the one you’d want in a do-or-die basketball game — narrowly edging Mauricio from Real Housewives of Beverly Hills.11 1:23 (Spurs 107-105) Wait, you ordered another breathtakingly crazy sequence? How ’bout Diaw barely missing a runner, Danny Green stuffing Blake’s tomahawk jam (whaaaaaaaat???), Parker missing a twisting layup (Spurs fans might not want to watch this tape for a while), Diaw snaring the rebound and finding a wide-open Green, Green MISSING the semi-dagger 3, then Parker easily putting back Green’s miss and getting shoved 5 feet back by Barnes — no call! Timeout, Clippers. “I do not want this series to end,” TNT’s Kevin Harlan yelps on the broadcast. Here’s why this was Coulda Woulda Shoulda Sequence No. 4: The Spurs ended up with two points, not three. Green played well in Game 7 on both ends, but that wide-open 3 hurt them; so did the no-call. By the way … Green, 2014 playoffs: 49.1% FG, 48% 3FG, 4.4 3FGA, 16.5 PER Green, 2015 playoffs: 34.4% FG, 30% 3FG, 5.7 3FGA, 10.4 PER12 (The only Spurs who played as well in the 2015 playoffs as they did in the 2014 playoffs: Duncan and Mills. Who woulda thunk? Maybe that’s one more reason for Duncan to come back — new blood! Free agents! I wish I could wager on things like “The Spurs will use a first-rounder to deal Splitter’s contract, talk Duncan into coming back, sign LaMarcus Aldridge and extend Kawhi. Fake Vegas odds: 5-to-1. I’m in for fake $100.) 1:09 (Spurs 107, Clips 107) Crawford beats Parker with a beautiful running one-hander off a Griffin handoff. Monster shot. Strange but true: Of the 148 players who qualified for the playoff PER leaders after Round 1, five of the top eight Clippers couldn’t crack the top 100: Barnes (10.8), Rivers (9.46), Redick (9.44), Crawford (8.86) and Big Baby Davis (7.51, putting him 130 out of 148). I don’t know whether to high-five Coach Doc or throw a drink in GM Doc’s face. 0:55 (Spurs 107, Clips 107) Kawhi makes a sweet hesitation move, finds the right shot (an open 12-footer) and totally short-arms it. Rebound, Griffin. (No DeAndre — still!) In the last three second halves of this series, Kawhi shot 3-for-23 and made only one shot that wasn’t a layup. That’s why, in Monday’s end-of-season press conference, Pop broke down Kawhi’s development as a future franchise guy by saying, “It’s a matter of understanding that it will be expected night after night after night.” And it’s probably coming. But the Spurs desperately needed Kawhi to kick ass in Game 82, Game 88 and/or Game 89; he wasn’t one of the three best players in this series. Even if that next-level leap will eventually come, much like it just came for Blake (three years older), Duncan can’t wait around forever. I blame myself for throwing the Apex Scottie comparisons around. Put it this way: 1993 Scottie would have gone after a hobbled CP3 like a cheetah going after a stray gazelle that wanders from the pack. Kawhi isn’t all the way there yet. By the time he gets there, Duncan will be gone. Alas. 0:30 (Spurs 107, Clips 107) The Clips take too long to run their patented Blake/Chris high screen and end up with Blake’s panic 18-footer, which quickly turns into Coulda Woulda Shoulda No. 5. Look at this picture …  Not only does it seem impossible for the Clips to snare that rebound, I’m getting Nam-like flashbacks to LeBron’s first brick in Game 6 that nearly decapitated Kawhi before bouncing off 15 guys and somehow landing back to LeBron for a made 3. And yet, Blake’s brick flew hard to the right, away from every Spur and directly at the only Clipper with a chance (Barnes). Timeout, Clippers. (This was also the moment when I remember looking around and thinking to myself, It feels like God doesn’t want San Antonio to win this game … or Steve Ballmer bought off God.) 0:13 (Clips 109-107) Monty McCutcheon belatedly calls Duncan for a body foul about 1.3 seconds after CP3 releases his missed jumper. Ludicrous whistle. When they no-called Barnes’s body block on Parker at 1:23, for me, that was our under-the-radar sign that the players would decide this game. Nope. Pop waves in disgust and turns back to his bench, like he was watching a meter maid writing him a ticket, said “Screw it,” and left the ticket on his car to get coffee. Go figure — Team Whine & Cheese got the shakiest big call of Round 1. Had the roles been reversed, they would have had to airlift a purple Doc out of Staples Center. (Yes, this was Coulda Woulda Shoulda Play No. 6. And yes, Chris made both free throws — giving him an astonishing 26 straight for the postseason. Timeout, Spurs.) 0:08 (Clips 109, Spurs 109) The Spurs run a beauty of a play, getting Duncan rolling to the basket off a switch and forcing Redick to foul him. That means Duncan, hovering at 50 percent for the series, now has to save San Antonio’s season from the free throw line. In the moment, I found myself rooting for him like he was a Boston guy. You can’t go out this way. You have to make these. The crowd was standing and hollering and whooping. It was REALLY loud. Only Duncan regrouped his 39-year-old one-legged body and freaking drained both of them. The Undertaker lives.  Additional Point No. 1: You look into someone’s basketball soul in those moments; we already knew what was inside Duncan, but man, those were like a 9.5 out of 10 on the Free Throw Pressure Scale. I actually think DeAndre Jordan would have grazed the shot clock with one of them. Duncan might be a mediocre free throw shooter, but for whatever reason, I trusted him in that moment. Usually, great players figure out how to get shit done. There’s no real stat for it, either — I’m pretty sure nobody gave a “Great Players Figure Out How To Get Shit Done” talk at the 2015 Sloan Conference. Sometimes it’s not about numbers. Additional Point No. 2: I don’t see how the same guy who made THOSE free throws can retire. He’s been the same guy for seven solid years. Freak. Alien. I see no sign of slippage other than the fact that he’s got one leg. (Thinking.) You’re right, that’s a problem. But I went to four of those seven games and didn’t see any laboring. NBA big men and wrestlers age the same way — they get stiff and lose their balance. Happens to everyone. When I went to WrestleMania 31 and watched the actual Undertaker wrestling, guess what? Shaky balance, moved like a half-mummy. It happens to all of these guys. Our two best Duncan doppelgängers from a body/physique/footwork/talent standpoint: probably Hakeem and Garnett. Happened to them, too. You could see the signs. I never felt that way watching Duncan — not once. 0:01 (Clips 111, Spurs 109) No biggie, just Chris Paul hitting the greatest shot of his life, one of the greatest game winners ever, the greatest shot in Clippers history and the latest series-winning shot ever taken in a Game 7. They played 341 minutes in this series; the Clippers took the lead for good at the 340:59 mark. The Spurs knew what play was coming, and so did the fans, only it didn’t matter. What’s amazing is that Paul always seemed to think it was going in. Everyone went bonkers, obviously. I have been in the building for some ear-splitting, everyone-loses-their-shit NBA reactions, ranging from Havlicek’s aforementioned banker (the triple-OT game) to Bird Steals the Ball to Ray Allen’s 3 to a slew of others. Really, there’s no “loudest” sound. Once you reach Everyone Loses Their Shit level, that’s it. You can’t get higher. To call this the most spectacular game in Clippers history would be like calling The Sixth Sense the most important movie of M. Night Shyamalan’s career. There are no other candidates. I don’t even know if the Clippers had an Unbreakable.13 It was also Coulda Woulda Shoulda No. 7 … because how the freaking hell did that shot go in??? I can’t even come up with another smaller player, in NBA history, who could have made that double-clutch angle with those two guys hounding him. Kyrie??? Maybe. Kevin Johnson? Maybe. CP3 played brilliantly all series, injured himself at the worst possible time, rallied back and ended up making history. And that seven-game series/battle/war/life experience brought that whole team closer together. Don’t sleep on the Clippers. 0:01 (Clips 111-109) I hated the shady whoops-the-buzzer-went-off clock fiasco for 120 different reasons, but mainly these four: It was shady as hell; it tipped off Barnes that the play was coming; it led to both Pop and owner Peter Holt serenading the scorekeeper with F-bombs (actually, I loved that);14 and it obscured the fact that Pop called a lousy, low-chance play. As far as shady end-of-the-series moments go, it wasn’t even half as ludicrous as Lakers fans storming the court before the ’88 Pistons tried their game-tying 3. Whatever. Our final score: Clippers 111, Spurs 109. A.k.a. the Chris Paul game. Like always, the Spurs put over another up-and-coming contender like a longtime wrestling champion would. As a reader named Vince in Lambertville writes, “Every so often, the Spurs get to hold the title and remind everyone, ‘We’re really freaking good.’ But they don’t need to defend the title for everyone to intuitively understand they’re the champs. Their greatest value is actually putting other teams over.” It’s so true — they did it for Dirk’s Mavericks, Nash’s Suns, Z-Bo’s Grizzlies, Durant’s Thunder, LeBron’s Heat, and now, CP3’s Clippers. Adds Vince, “That series was like a 35-minute WWE classic. All that was left was Duncan standing in the middle of the ring, raising CP3’s hand and pointing at him. I’m going to miss these guys when they’re not around anymore.” Me too. And I don’t care if it was Round 1. That’s one of the 12 best seven-game series since 1976’s ABA-NBA merger if you’re ranking for star power, general story lines, legacy-related story lines, closeness of the games, atmosphere, and iconic games/plays/moments … Honorable Mention: 1978 Bullets-Sonics, 1980 Sonics-Bucks, 1981 Sixers-Bucks, 1988 Mavs-Lakers, 1990 Blazers-Spurs, 1992 Bulls-Knicks, 1993 Suns-Sonics, 1994 Suns-Rockets, 1995 Magic-Pacers, 2000 Knicks-Heat, 2000 Lakers-Blazers, 2004 Kings-Wolves, 2009 Celts-Bulls (lost its “Best Round 1 Series Ever” belt), 2010 Celts-Lakers, 2012 Celts-Heat. The Top 12: 1979 Bullets-Spurs (Ice blows a 3-1 lead), 1981 Sixers-Celtics (the championship belt holder), 1984 Celts-Lakers (four iconic games!), 1987 Bucks-Celtics (best second-rounder ever),15 1987 Celts-Pistons (insane), 1988 Lakers-Pistons (doubly insane), 1995 Pacers-Knicks (Reggie vs. Ewing), 1998 Pacers-Bulls (MJ taken to the brink), 2002 Lakers-Kings (the NBA goes WWE), 2006 Mavs-Spurs (the lost great 21st-century series), 2013 Heat-Spurs (a life experience) and 2015 Spurs-Clips. That’s an unassailable list. And thanks to the NBA’s primitive playoff setup and San Antonio’s uncharacteristic Game 82 stumble in New Orleans, two of the NBA’s four best teams ended up clashing in Round 1. Total fluke. The Spurs blew Game 6 at home, couldn’t put Game 7 away and lost when a great player made an even greater shot. Either that was the best possible way for Duncan to go out (with a bang, still playing well) or the worst possible way (because it was, to borrow a poker term, something of an unlucky beat). Only he knows. The night ended with the Spurs partying in Los Angeles, because why not? They’re the unofficial champs even when they’re not the champs. In a classic twist, Aron Baynes was overserved and none other than Tim Duncan carried poor Baynes to the team’s bus. Of course, TMZ’s cameras were following them. They looked like the real-life version of Kevin Costner carrying John C. Reilly to his room at the end of For Love of the Game. Tim Duncan, the ultimate teammate. Always. ??? So … should Duncan retire? If it feels like a sports movie moment, that’s because it’s basically the plot in For Love of the Game, everyone’s favorite baseball movie that’s locked in the basement of a reprehensible romance drama. Like everyone else, I devour the baseball scenes and hate-watch the Kelly Preston scenes. I love watching Billy Chapel (Costner) go for the perfect game while muttering to himself like a lunatic. I love the “I love you, Mickey Hart!” scene. I love Vin Scully. I love Costner’s buddy on the other team who sold out and joined the Yankees. I love watching John C. Reilly pretending to be a catcher. I love the moment when Costner realizes he has a perfect game going. I love Vern Schillinger Whiplash Simmons as Costner’s manager. I love “Clear the mechanism.” And I really love one particular moment, right near the end, when Chapel realizes that everything hurts too much. That he doesn’t want to pitch for anyone else. That he’s too expensive to keep but too stubborn to switch teams. Everything just falls into place for him during that game. He doesn’t want to pitch anymore. He wants to leave on a high. And in the best scene of the movie, he fights off the tears in the dugout, scribbles something on a baseball and sends it up to the team’s president with the game still unfolding. “Tell them I’m through — For love of the game, Billy Chapel.” Always gets me. Well, couldn’t you see Duncan leaving that way next month? No press conference, no fanfare, no farewell tour, no exit interviews. Just tell ’em I’m done. How does someone even reach that point? Nineteen out of 20 times in basketball, a legend’s body makes the choice for him: Bird, Magic, Jordan, Shaq, Hakeem, Barkley, Malone, Elgin … you can keep going and going. But that 20th time, that’s when it gets complicated. Now it’s a mental thing. When you know it’s time to go, it’s not about the games, the locker rooms, the camaraderie, the charter planes and the salaries anymore. All of that stuff makes you want to keep playing, actually. But preparing to play — that’s the culprit. It’s the mental burden that saps you. You start missing your freedom. You have to eat a certain way, sleep a certain way, prepare a certain way. You learn to dread those mornings after back-to-backs. You hate those early wakeup calls, hate being at the gym for hours by yourself, hate working on things that you already learned a million years ago. You already peaked, and you know it, so it’s all about killing yourself so you can be 70 percent as good as you once were. You have young dudes coming at you left and right, always looking to prove themselves, doing anything possible to put themselves on the map against you. Shit, you could see it with Blake Griffin in Round 1. He didn’t just want to win, he wanted to take it to Duncan. Again and again and again. So it’s not about one more year. It’s about 18 of them, and how they add up and start subtracting from the current product. Could the Spurs have beaten the Clips with a healthier Parker? Will free agency help? Will Kawhi make The Leap? Could Duncan have blocked that CP3 shot? Did he get there in time? Was he a split second late? Did his brain see it coming, completely and totally, only his body couldn’t quite get there? I bet Duncan is asking himself all of these things. He will disappear this summer, like he always does, and he will remain in shape by swimming and eating plants and doing whatever else aliens do. Some time before July 1, he will share his plan with the Spurs. Only Duncan knows if it will be one year too early. I just know that he’s one of the best basketball players I have ever seen. I hope he comes back. And I hope he doesn’t come back.",2015-05-05T12:10:43+00:00,2015 NBA Playoffs,Simmons
190,The Mailbag Reunion Tour Continues,"Before we tackle a few mailbag questions, I need to jack up some shots to get loose. Let’s rip through a few quick Round 1 awards. Stand under the basket and rebound for me, please. Seriously. Go down there. And throw me nice, crisp passes right at my chest. Thanks. Here we go. Game 1 of Clips-Spurs featured two all-time Blake dunks; the best-ever CP3-and-Blake-peaking-in-the-same-game performance; Aron Baynes being defiled in so many different ways that everyone in Staples Center kept waiting for the Gimp from Pulp Fiction to climb out of a trunk; a Jamal Crawford heat check; an uncharacteristically tremendous crowd (about 99 percent pro-Clips, which is atypical); and everyone realizing at the same time, “Holy shit, the Clips might be able to make the Finals with seven guys!” In 10 years of owning Clips season tickets, that’s the fourth-best Clips game I’ve ever attended, trailing only Game 7 of Warriors-Clips in 2014, LeBron vs. Peak Dumbleavy in 2009 and the unforgettable 2007 contest when Tim Thomas played 30 minutes without ever crossing either 3-point line. In Game 3 against Golden State, the Pelicans blew a 55-point fourth-quarter lead in less than four minutes (all numbers approximate) in such an unsurprising meltdown that (a) I had to catch a 6:11 a.m. Acela train this morning from Boston to New York, (b) I was lying in my hotel bed at midnight thinking to myself, I could go to sleep right now and I’d get five solid hours, and (c) I stayed awake only because the Warriors AND Monty Williams were involved. Any member of the 400-Hour Club (those who have watched more than 400 hours of League Pass this season) learned by December never to give up on a seemingly insurmountable Pelicans lead or Warriors deficit. This was the perfect storm. The Warriors are playing Draymond Green at center and moving into Totally Frantic mode? Steph is hoisting 3s from the parking lot? Monty looks confused? Giddyup! Additional note for the history nerds out there: For the 2015 Warriors to go down as an all-time team, they need to win the title AND finish 16-4 in the playoffs AND sweep at least two series AND submit a few memorable lay-the-smack-down games along the way AND create three or four iconic moments (like Curry’s game-saving Shoulda-Been-A-Four-Pointer). Game 3 was everything I wanted from them. Great teams come through on the road when they don’t have it. We’ll remember that one. Obviously this goes to the polarizing former All-Star from the Mavs-Rockets series who graduated from Oak Hill and changed teams during the season … so, congratulations to Jo— wait, it’s not Josh Smith? The violent, grisly, emotionally scarring and unexpectedly abrupt death of Playoff Rondo ranks right up there with the end of Furious 7 for me. I loved Playoff Rondo almost as much as I loved National TV Rondo. Those two guys represented everything I love and hate about sports all wrapped into the same perplexing package — the audacity of someone telling us during most regular-season games, Even though you paid to see me, and even though I make eight figures a year, you’re not getting my best tonight, coupled with the brilliance of someone who could say, There are real stakes tonight, so you’re getting my A-game, and by the way, I’m gonna be awesome. I would love to know how my wife handled it if we were to go out for dinner once a week for four weeks, and every time, I wouldn’t say that much and would act weird but make just enough jokes to make the dinner passable … only every time we went out with another couple, I’d be hilarious and gregarious and charismatic and keep telling everyone, “You’re with Double-Date Simmons tonight!!!!!” You know what would happen? She’d dump Double Date Simmons and Regular Season Simmons. Only in sports can you pull off the idea of Playoff Rondo. And now it’s dead. R.I.P. Dallas gambled (AND ruined their bench AND wasted a first-round pick) by flagrantly violating the “You can get away with one head case, just don’t give him someone to hang out with” rule by teaming up Monta Ellis and Rondo. And even worse, they never considered things like, “Should we be worried that Rick Carlisle is a control freak who wants constant ball movement and Rondo loves to dominate the ball and control everything?” and “Should we be worried that Rondo can’t get to the line, can’t make free throws and can’t shoot 3s even though we’re in the pace-and-space/3s-and-free-throws era?” What a quietly devastating trade for them. Now they’re getting swept and have a future built around a winding-it-down Dirk, Chandler Parsons, cap space, Carlisle and Cubes. Yikes. And even worse, this whole thing led to Sad Dirk! I hate Sad Dirk! Me. For everything in the previous paragraph. See, I absolutely LOVED the Rondo trade for Dallas and thought he was a semi-shell of himself in Boston only because he was playing possum. I haven’t misfired like that since … oh, wait, I’m wrong all the time. On the bright side, we finally got to watch an NBA star carry himself in playoff games with the exact same enthusiasm as a divorced dad ringing the doorbell of his ex-wife’s house.1 And even better, I just won a Roger Goodell Award! Rondo lost between $30 million and $40 million this summer with that Mavericks fiasco. On the bright side, drunk Lakers fans and drunk Knicks fans everywhere are texting their friends, “Dp you think we csn get Ronddo at a bigf disconyt?” Randy Wittman winning two straight in Toronto while battling the usual stuff that comes with coaching a team that just spent the season underachieving, sucking the life out of its fans and taking the Clogged Toilet offense to new heights. Two days after Wittman submitted one of the funniest Vines ever (saving it for later) and just hours after Grantland’s Andrew Sharp explained the seven ways that Wizards fans should cope with the never-ending Wittman era, the Ex-Bullets owned Game 2 and played their finest two hours under Wittman. Now you have D.C. fans like my buddy House saying, “We could absolutely beat the Hawks in Round 2 even if we get outcoached, as long as we don’t get TOTALLY outcoached.” So you’re tellin’ me there’s a chance.  YEAH!!!!!!! WITTMAN!!!!!!! Spurs-Clips is wildly overqualified for Round 1, which is the biggest reason it’s so damned fun — the NBA equivalent of throwing Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson into eight True Detective episodes. Game 1? Unbelievable. Game 2? That one had the intensity, weightiness, electricity and sophistication of an actual Finals game; got derailed by Hack-A-DeAndre and some uncharacteristically horrific Pop/Doc coaching; featured multiple bricks and multiple turnovers and multiple stars coming up short … and yet I absolutely loved being there for it. Sometimes you’re watching a game and you just know that it might become a horrendous, kicking-yourself-for-years defeat for EITHER team. It ended up being the Clippers. We’ll see if it lingers. (Quick aside: I’ve been sharing Clips tickets with my friend Tollin since 2008, when I was about to give them up and he said, “Wait, you can’t give them up. What if they become good?” And then we both laughed for about 20 seconds before I said, “Screw it, one more year.” Anyway, we were walking out after Game 2 and Tollin said, “Spurs-Clippers … it’s just never gonna change with these guys, is it?” In other words, the Spurs continue to be the hammer and the Clippers continue to be the nail.) Deron Williams’s wide-open 16-footer that would have tied Game 2 in Atlanta (and didn’t). I never thought that thing was going in. Not for one second. “CP3 or Deron?” is starting to feel more dated than “Jay Z or Nas?” So Nic Batum has hated Spain for years because of the well-documented Spain-France international basketball rivalry, he jokingly posted a “WE DON’T LOSE TO SPANISH PLAYERS” sign in their locker room … and that became a Shame Police story for two days? I don’t know one person — seriously, not one — who would be offended by that sign. Do I just have the wrong people in my life? Are my friends and family doing a terrible job of protecting society? Should I start taking an outrage booster? Do they sell outrage boosters? Is there a class that can teach me how to make morally superior, out-of-context shame police tweets? I made a New York City work trip much harder by squeezing a 7 a.m. Thursday flight to Boston into the mix just to watch my underdog Celtics (hopefully) topple LeBron and the Cavs. Didn’t happen. Turns out that it’s a problem when the other team has the three best players in a playoff series, including one of the eight best players of all time. But you know what? How many of these LeBronian playoff eviscerations are left? You know, the ones when he shows up in someone else’s house and breaks windows and plates and tables for two hours as 15,000 to 20,000 exuberant people slowly lose the will to live? Maybe … 15? Does he have 20? I mean, he’s closing in on 44,000 minutes by the end of this postseason. You never know. Getting to see him in Queen of the Chessboard mode — the ultimate power guard, the ultimate mismatch, the ultimate athlete, the ultimate thinker, and of course, the ultimate crybaby who somehow hasn’t committed a foul since he returned to the Cavs (sorry, I had to) — was worth the cross-country flight and the two early alarm blares. Now that they’ve figured out the right people to throw around him (as well as the right style), and now that he’s in the right shape, he’s still the most dangerous basketball player alive. LeBron was, I don’t know, maybe EIGHT PERCENT better two years ago during his Miami apex? Just an amazing experience to watch that dude do his thing as my Boston brethren booed him and yelled insults at him. I loved it. I’m glad I went back. Hey, everybody, it’s the reeling Raptors! Would Indy trade George Hill and the no. 11 pick for DeMar DeRozan?3 Would Sacramento pony up Darren Collison, Sauce Castillo and the no. 6 pick for Kyle Lowry? Would Denver take the 20th pick and Terrence Ross for Danilo Gallinari? Would the Lakers flip Julius Randle for DeRozan so they could clear the 4-spot for Kevin Love? What kind of Godfather offer for Andrew Wiggins would Flip Saunders have the pleasure of rejecting? What if the Raptors landed no. 6 and no. 11 in Lowry/DeRozan trades, then offered those picks to Flip — along with Toronto’s juicy pick in the 2016 Nuggets-Knicks-Raptors pick swap (Denver gets first choice, Toronto gets second choice, Knicks get nothing and like it) — for the rights to acquire Maple Jordan? What if Flip countered by saying, “You have to throw in Jonas too”? Derrick Rose suddenly looking kinda maybe sorta like Derrick Rose again. (Note: I’m obeying all jinxing rules.) Even if they don’t make it past Round 2, he’s reclaimed enough of his trade value that, at the very least, Knicks fans are now petrified that Phil Jackson might flip their top-three pick for Rose in two months. Baby steps. Good time to morph into a mini-mailbag. As always, these are actual questions from actual readers. Q: Derrick Rose carrying the Bulls to the 2015 championship would be the best playoff story in NBA history, right?
—Dominic G., Champaign, IL BS: So much for obeying all jinxing rules. Here’s your current top five: 1. MJ, Utah, 1998. Greatest player ever caps off the greatest three-year run ever with his greatest feat (beating the Jazz basically by himself in Utah in Game 6) and the greatest thing I’ve ever seen a basketball player do (the iconic layup-steal-jumper sequence). How are we topping that? 2. A running-on-fumes Celtics dynasty winning its last title (11 out of 13!) even though (a) player-coach Bill Russell and crunch-time god Sam Jones were retiring after the season, (b) they didn’t have home court in any playoff series, (c) they were heavy Finals dogs against a Lakers team that had Wilt, Elgin AND West, (d) three of their four Finals games were won in the final minute, (e) they won Game 7 on the road partly because a pissed-off Russell had stumbled upon the Lakers’ elaborate postgame plan for a balloon celebration. The greatest winner in sports history going out in the greatest way possible? Come on. 3. The 2014 Spurs redeem the worst Finals loss ever while simultaneously murdering the LeBron era in Miami. 4. Magic, 1980, Game 6. 5. Willis, Game 7, 1970. Here’s what I love about Rose’s story (if it plays out in the best possible way): It’s like a sports movie, right? Local kid wins MVP, signs two huge contracts with the Bulls and Adidas, blows out his knee, comes back, keeps getting hurt, never gives up … and suddenly he’s holding a Finals MVP, crying on the podium and hugging his mom (played by Octavia Spencer) and his brother (played by Anthony Anderson). “Based on a true story: Michael B. Jordan plays Derrick Rose in The Rebound.” That’s definitely a top-four all-time NBA playoff story if it happens. You could also talk me into Matt Damon gaining 25 pounds to play an embattled but dedicated NBA coach who keeps getting railroaded and undercut by his front office, then shoves it in their faces by winning a title in the heartwarming Disney movie Thibs. Q: On various podcasts, you’ve mentioned how home court advantage may no longer exist due to various reasons (StubHub, increasing cost, HDTV is so good). Flash forward to Wednesday night — had the Clips not given away Game 2, home teams would have been 14-2 in the first round. Have fun with that, road teams! Enjoy that SIMMONS STINK! SIMMONS!
—Ross, Santa Barbara, CA BS: My defense, only because I hate being wrong: Couldn’t you say that more people than ever are selling their regular-season tickets, then holding on to their playoff seats? Let’s see how Games 3 and 4 play out. Q: The year Tim Duncan made his NBA debut, Seinfeld was still on the air, Bill Clinton was still having “sexual relations” with Monica Lewinsky, The English Patient won the Oscar, Spice Girls had the top-selling album, Google didn’t exist and I didn’t know how to masturbate yet (side note: I’m 30 now). Damn.
—Alex V BS: And I was a single bartender writing this column for $300 per week for a website that could only be accessed by people with AOL accounts. On the bright side, I DID know how to masturbate. Wait a second, how the hell did you pull me into Weirdoville? Get me out of here! Q: What would you say the LVP rankings of the playoffs are so far? Rondo is obviously first, then I would say D-Will at two. 
—Brad, Huntington, WV BS: Yeah, that’s your Bird and Magic of the 2015 LVP so far. It’s a two-man race. Honorable mention: Dame Lillard (even earned a rare TV upbraid from Barkley), Kyle Lowry (is he hurt???), Dirk Nowitzki (for defensive reasons only), Omer Asik (a plus-minus calamity), Masai Ujiri (for freezing at the trade deadline), Kelly Olynyk (could someone tell him the playoffs started?), Lionel Hollins (for not having the balls to just bench Deron), Cleveland’s crowd (did you ever think Miami would have given LeBron a better playoff atmosphere than Cleveland????)4 and Rondo a second time. Q: In the DFW area, it seems the common view now is that not resigning Josh Hamilton to a huge deal was a GREAT decision. Watching the Angels try to find ANY way to shed his albatross of a contract, we feel good about the decision. Is that how Boston fans feel about Rondo? Are Boston fans glad they “sold high,” or are they waiting to re-sign him after the season?
—Wes, Dallas BS: The only four things that would excite Boston fans less than a Rondo return: another 109 inches of snow next winter; the Globe announcing that it had re-signed Dan Shaughnessy for another 15 years; Boston winning the 2024 Summer Olympics bid; and the Red Sox signing Rick Porcello to a four-year, $82.5 million contract extension. (Listening.) Wait, what???? Q: Thanks to State Farm we know that every NBA player has a separated-at-birth twin who ends up being an insurance agent. Chris Paul has Cliff, Stephen Curry has Sebastian, John Stockton has Don etc. Who would Rajon Rondo’s twin insurance agent would be?
—Matt, New York BS: Definitely Rick Rondo, a name that makes him sound like a porn actor, WWE star or twin insurance agent. Are we sure Rick Rondo wasn’t the guy that Boston sent to Dallas three months ago? Your best case for a Rondo resurgence next season: If Dennis Rodman can average 15 rebounds per game in Chicago and win a ring 12 months after his 1995 Spurs flame-out that reverse-peaked with Rodman taking his sneakers off in a huddle during a key timeout in a key playoff game, I’m pretty sure we can’t write off Rondo yet. Q: Isn’t the “German Rondo” nickname a major insult to Dennis Schroeder now? The small group of real Hawks fans don’t cringe every time he steps up to the line.
—Brandon, Winston Salem BS: Tough mailbag for Rondo. Tough times. None of this makes me happy. On the other hand, much like T.J. Lavin, I hate quitters. And Rondo quit on Dallas. He did. Q: I never forgot how you made “Bob Sacre” happen. As your next rename victory, might I suggest Willie Cauley-Stein aka “Bill Stein” from Kentucky? Do it.
—Jackson, Vancouver BS: I’d rather get “Tony” going for Anthony Davis. Watch Game 4 of Pels-Warriors and scream out “Toe-neee!” the first time Davis throws down an alley-oop. It feels surprisingly good. “Tony” gives Davis a little extra danger; suddenly he’s the muscle-head who might take his shirt off in the club and try to fight a bouncer. Q: Did you know James Dolan was a disaster expert? Is it just me or is this hilarious???
—Dustin, Santa Barbara BS: Everyone reading this column has one week to trump The Other James Dolan is a disaster expert in a new game that we’ll call “Find someone who has the exact same name as a celebrity, but also has a ridiculous job that somehow ties into how ridiculous the celebrity is.” (Cut to thousands of people Googling “Roger Goodell, sewage specialist.”) Q: With the Trail Blazers stunning playoff collapse, the injury to Wes Matthews, and The Assassination of Damian Lillard by the Coward Mike Conley, does LaMarcus Aldridge seriously contemplate leaving this summer? Imagine him and Kawhi in S.A. for the next five years!
—Paul C., Los Altos, CA BS: I don’t mean to anger Rip City, but we have to discuss this one. You could make a strong case for Aldridge being in play this summer. It will be Year 10 for him; he needs to win now. He just lost Wesley Matthews, and there’s no looming sign that Portland will ever find that third piece to put that team over the hump. He’s not nearly famous enough for someone who was one of the league’s 10 best players for two straight years. He’s from Dallas and attended the University of Texas, which opens up going-back-home possibilities in San Antonio (Duncan’s replacement?), Dallas (the Mavs’ new franchise guy?) AND Houston (his best chance for a quickie Finals trip). Then again, Houston wouldn’t be his team; it already belongs to Harden. Dallas is heading in the wrong direction and already sent its top-seven-protected pick to Boston next season; I don’t see how that’s a better basketball situation than Portland’s this summer. As for San Antonio … I mean, would YOU want to replace Tim Duncan and spend the rest of your career being compared to him? That answer could go either way, I guess. The good side: Pop, Spurs, Kawhi, infrastructure, first-class fans. The bad side: If it doesn’t go splendidly, you become The Guy Who Screwed It Up After Duncan Left. Which makes me think Orlando (assets + talent + youth + Florida), Boston (assets + youth + role players + President Stevens + great owner/front office) and New York (biggest market, Carmelo, top-three pick, cap space) could be legitimate LaMarcus players here. Four months ago, I would have said it was a 99 percent chance he stayed. Right now, it has to be 50/50. And dropping. If it means something to him to retire in Portland someday, he’ll stay. If not, he’ll leave. But it’s definitely not the best basketball situation for him. And by the way, Lillard is the Blazer getting commercials these days, not Aldridge. If you don’t think that matters to these guys, you’re crazy. Q: Did Nikola Mirotic win this year’s Peja Stojakovic Award for the player with the most obvious body waxing?
—Mike, Oklahoma City BS: By a landslide. We canceled the vote. He also won the “NBA Player Who Easily Could Have Appeared On a Mumblecore Movie Poster” award. Q: Are you excited that we finally have a video that proves DelNegroitis exists?
—TJ, Richmond, VA BS: I’m giddy, I’m relieved, I’m overwhelmed … I feel like Jonas Salk after he found out that his vaccine worked. Q: Do you think Tim Duncan has a painting with his soul entrapped in it that he is not allowed to look at?
—Michael, Binghamton, NY BS: It can’t be ruled out. Important Duncan note that jumps out when you watch him in person … his left leg does not work. Like, he drags it around as if it were a prosthetic. That thing does NOT work. He does everything off his right leg. Everything. Tim Duncan is amazing. YEAR EIGHTEEN!!!!! Is there any objective NBA fan who wouldn’t have rather had Duncan from 1997 to now instead of Kobe from 1997 to 2015 if the only objectives were “I want to try to win 55-65 games every year and I want to try to win multiple titles”? How can you pass up 18 straight years of Duncan? Only Kareem and Mailman were able to stay that good for that long. Fact: Tim Duncan is older than Brad Stevens. Fact: It doesn’t seem to matter. And no, it still hasn’t been explained to me why Duncan would retire yet. The quality of his game, night to night, hasn’t changed for five solid years. Well, except that he’s playing on one leg. Q: I went and played golf with three friends on Sunday. After we played, we went to a bar to drink beer, eat wings and watch the NBA playoffs. When we got to the bar the Hawks and Nets were playing. On another TV, My 600 Lb Life was on. I was more interested in the struggles of a 600 lb woman than watching another horrible Eastern Conference Playoff Series. I have been watching the NBA Playoffs since 1987 religiously every year but I had zero interest in this game. Can we please start a petition to have the playoffs reseeded by record?
—Jeff, Webster, TX BS: Your reseeded first round for 2015: Warriors-Celtics (1/16), Hawks-Bucks (2/15), Rockets-Thunder (3/14), Clippers-Pelicans (4/13), Grizzlies-Wizards (5/12), Spurs-Raptors (6/11), Cavs-Mavs (7/10), Blazers-Bulls (8/9). I mean … that’s an even worse Round 1 than the current one, right? But don’t worry: When I take over as President Hillary’s sports czar in 2017, all American professional sports leagues will be forced to adopt a “You have to finish .500 or better to make the playoffs” rule and we’ll never have to worry about things like the dead-eyed Nets making the playoffs over Westbrook and the Thunder again. Q: Any chance you could work in a Yi Jianlian chair joke into something soon? It’s just so enjoyable for me. Every. Single. Time. And it’s certainly been way too long.
—Dustin, Clearfield BS: All footage of Yi posting up the chair has been wiped away from the Internet (probably on orders from the Chinese government), although we still have this rare workout clip of Chairman Yi dominating the Invisible Man …  … as well as this lovable picture of Yi sitting on a chair that I’ll drop later in the column for comedic purposes. Hold tight. Q: What are we naming the tanking process for the 2015-16 NBA season now that your illegitimate son, Ben Simmons, is poised to be the top pick? Can we come up with something as good as “Suck for Luck” or “Riggin’ for Wiggins”? What about “Trimmin’ for Simmons” or “The Skid for Bill’s Kid?”
—Bryce, Dayton BS: Putting “Lossie for the Aussie” and “Skimmin’ for Simmons” as placeholders until the readers can top it. Stay tuned. Q: I am a big fan … but I lost a chunk of my fandom when you let me down. I just found out that the newly-minted sixth man, Lou Williams had two hot girlfriends at the same time. How did I not get this information from you first? You should be on top on these stuff, mate! C’mon!
—Chris, Sydney BS: Get ready to lose an even bigger chunk of fandom — I had no idea that Lou Williams had two girlfriends. Doesn’t this make sense, though? Lou Williams is really two basketball players — there’s the Lou Williams who single-handedly sways games à la Jamal Crawford, and then there’s the Lou Williams who models his game after a poor man’s hybrid of Randy Foye and Dion Waiters and has absolutely no problem going 4-for-18. Maybe each of those guys needed their own lady. Now we need to arrange a quadruple date with Good Lou Williams, Bad Lou Williams, Rajon Rondo and Rick Rondo. Q: When we’re first introduced to Jaime Lannister in Game of Thrones, he’s having sex with his SISTER and then PUSHES A KID OUT OF A WINDOW (intending to kill him). Amazingly, by the end of that season we’re thinking, “Ah, he’s not so bad. Pretty charming, actually.” Now we’re actively rooting for him. Can you think of another instance where a real person or a character did something so despicable, only to later turn babyface?
—Trent Smith, Cary BS: It would have to be something really egregious and really unrealistic — like LeBron failing to bring Cleveland a title, then ditching Cleveland in his prime on a live television special so he could team up with Wade and Bosh in Miami, winning two titles for the Heat and making four straight Finals, then heroically returning to Cleveland like nothing ever happened. Q: I have a local NBA ad that’s worse that Isaiah Thomas’ pizza one — what about Bradley Beal for Eastern Motors?
—Blake C., Charlottesville, VA  BS: Didn’t that fit in with the rest of Bradley Beal’s letdown season, though? He went backward in every way. Earlier this month, I sent Ron Mercer’s career stats to Wizards fans House and Sharp with the sentence, “Bradley Beal is your Ron Mercer.” (Keep in mind, I’m the same guy who once wrote an entire column for his old website in 1998 based around the premise, “Ron Mercer is God’s gift for taking Reggie Lewis away from us.” I LOVED Ron Mercer.) Sharp responded “/gulps /reads Ron mercer stats /blinks repeatedly /stares off into space like Wittman watching this season go down in flames” while House literally disappeared and was never heard from again until the Wiz won two games. Q: On Sunday night, Marten Weiner (aka Mad Men’s Glen Bishop) and Austin Rivers faced off tonight in a primetime showdown to determine which one of them is the most flagrant example of nepotism currently on television. Can we just start calling Rivers “Glen Bishop” right now? After all, they might both be going off the air soon.
—Jimmy, Los Angeles BS: I loved everything about this email — especially how Doc Rivers and Matthew Weiner (Mad Men’s creator and showrunner) probably went through the same series of mental steps before casting their sons. I mean, I need someone who’s right around that age and has those types of skills … and I know better than anyone that my son just needs a chance … and I’ll be able to help him get where he needs to go … and also, it will make my wife happy. But for the record, at least Austin Rivers can play solid defense and get through three-minute stretches without killing you. I can’t remember ever saying the words, “Thank God for that Glen Bishop scene.” Marten Weiner makes Robert Iler look like Daniel Day-Lewis. (Hold on, big “but” coming … ) BUT I can totally identify with Weiner-Rivers syndrome. You’re always going to overrate your own son. Just this week, my 7-year-old son figured out how to rig NHL 15 to start goalie fights — he plays the Kings’ opponent, repeatedly goes offside and makes runs at Jonathan Quick, and then, when Quick gets upset, he switches controllers and presses the “Y” button until Quick is fighting with the other team’s goalie. It’s the dumbest, most brilliant video-game strategy I have ever witnessed. This is on the heels of him ripping off 25 different WWE finishing moves in three minutes on our hotel bed the morning of WrestleMania 31 for a YouTube video that I can never put up because he’s not wearing a shirt and Internet creeps scare me. Is there a chance my son will be living at home until he’s 40? No question. Did you read the previous paragraph? If I had the chance to do whatever my version of “casting him on my TV show or my NBA team” would be, I’d do it. And no, there’s no better example of Weiner-Rivers syndrome than Charles Dolan and Dr. Jerry Buss. I probably shouldn’t turn things over to my son, but, well, I love him and I want him to do well! Q: Has there ever been a show with a more pointless “Scenes from next week’s episode” than the Mad Men montage at the end of each episode? With gems like “Get me a drink” and “Who’s there?”, I figure next week’s episode could just as well be about making a turkey sandwich or assembling furniture than running an ad agency.
—Dave, Greensboro BS: Supposedly Weiner hates giving away anything in “scenes from next week’s episode” montages. You have to love the moxie of someone who zealously protects the secrecy of next week’s episode while also giving away pivotal scenes to his overmatched son. I’m gonna miss Matthew Weiner. Great show. Hold on, this paragraph was pretty pedestrian. We need a comedy infusion.  Q: For our senior trip, my high school graduating class went to Disneyland for the day. We entered the park at 7 a.m. and thirty minutes later saw Robin Lopez in line for a ride by himself wearing a Chip n’ Dale Rescue Rangers shirt. (I am still baffled their exists a market for seven foot men who want to wear shirts with Disney characters on them). Being from Arizona we wildly greeted him, as he had absolutely bombed for the Suns two years prior, to which we received the least enthusiastic wave in recorded history. Several hours later we saw a jovial Asian family riding the River Rapids ride with Robin Lopez as the sixth person on the ride. The sheer comedy of a diminutive Asian family and a seven foot NBA player with a red afro sharing the same ride cannot be explained, it seriously might have been the funniest thing I have ever seen. At 10 PM I again saw him completely alone, and again tried to start a conversation with him, which he completely ignored. In case your keeping track, that’s 13 hours at Disneyland, completely by himself, wearing a children’s T-shirt.
—Daniel Skelly, Scottsdale BS: I never run I saw (fill in the celebrity) and something funny happened emails in the mailbag, but made an exception here only because (a) you couldn’t make this story up, and (b) from everything I’ve ever heard or read about the Lopez brothers, they’re the real-life version of the Hanson brothers. So I believe this story and it made me laugh. And yup, these are my readers.",2015-04-24T13:42:57+00:00,2015 NBA Playoffs,Simmons
191,This Is the End: Time for the Week 17 Picks,"I want to find you the perfect Super Bowl bet. It’s my holiday gift to you. We’re looking for an undervalued long shot with a better chance to get lucky for four weeks than everyone realizes. A good example: Cousin Sal and I dropped some Benjamins on the 2014 Royals right before the AL wild-card game — 18-to-1 odds! — and came within a Madison Bumgarner out-of-body experience of cashing in. Could we have cashed in anyway just by hedging that 18-to-1 wager with a Giants bet in Game 7? Of course! We’re enormous idiots. Don’t ever forget this. But that’s the kind of future wager you want to make. Longer odds on an undervalued fringe contender, basically. Our Super Bowl odds heading into Week 17 … New England: +250
Seattle: +260
Green Bay: 6-to-1
Denver: 7-to-1
Dallas: 10-to-1
Pittsburgh: 18-to-1
Detroit: 30-to-1
Indianapolis: 30-to-1
Cincinnati: 45-to-1
San Diego: 55-to-1
Arizona: 60-to-1
Baltimore: 70-to-1
Atlanta: 80-to-1
Carolina: 100-to-1
Houston: 400-to-1
Kansas City: 1200-to-1 Let’s cross off the Colts (2014’s Good Bad Team), the Lions (because they’re the Lions), San Diego (too banged up), Baltimore (atrocious pass defense), Atlanta (atrocious everything defense), Carolina (come on), Houston (stop it) and Kansas City (please). And let’s cross off New England, Seattle, Green Bay, Denver and Dallas because the return on top-five contenders just isn’t lucrative enough; you’re better off betting on them game-by-game. That suddenly leaves us with three teams: Pittsburgh: 18-to-1 Cincinnati: 45-to-1 Arizona: 60-to-1 Did I stare at those Cardinals odds for 20 minutes? You know me too well. They’re almost definitely headed for a 5-seed and a Round 1 game in Atlanta or Carolina … and if Drew Stanton comes back in time, that’s an exceedingly winnable game. Then, they might have to go to Seattle for Round 2 and… oh, who am I kidding? Cross them off. So that leaves Pittsburgh at 18-to-1 and Cincy at 45-to-1. What’s the right pick? You’ll have to wait until the end of this column. Let’s hit Week 17 picks and cover everything that’s at stake (and I mean everything). Home Teams in Caps Colts (-7) over TITANS
At Stake: The Colts are already locked into the no. 4 seed (barring a Bengals-Steelers tie), as well as probable “home dog” status in Round 1 … with one more loss, Tennessee clinches the no. 2 overall pick (Shame Us For Jameis!) and maybe even the first overall pick if Tampa beats New Orleans (Suck For The Duck!), as well as its worst season in almost 30 years … Ken Whisenhunt could lose his 25th game out of his last 28 (not a misprint) …  Trent Richardson needs 34 more yards to break 1,000 yards (for 2013 and 2014 combined, and only as a Colt, but still). Q: Has any team in recent memory ever come out and just snatched the Bad Good Team Championship with such conviction like Indy did in Dallas on Sunday?
–Donnie, Seattle BS: Poor Baltimore is reeling — the Ravens thought they’d lock up the 2014 Bad Good Team trophy by beating Cleveland in Week 17, then finishing 10-6 even though they (a) never beat another 10-win team after Pittsburgh in Week 2, and (b) lost to the Colts in Week 5 in what should have been the Bad Good Team championship game. But Indy losing to the Steelers, Pats and Cowboys since Week 8 by a combined 135-61 margin is just tough to overcome. Don’t worry, you still won 2014’s Karma Police award, Baltimore. Sing it, creepy Polish band that might give me nightmares tonight!  Q: After today’s Colts cameo, did Matt Hasselbeck just shatter the Holy Shit This Guy’s Still in the NFL award?
–Daniel S., Scottsdale BS: Bonus points because Hasselbeck threw us off the scent by announcing a Week 10 Fox game (during Indy’s bye week). Lots of dumb award honors for Indy this year — they also won the “How The Hell Could Anyone’s Running Backs Be This Bad?” award, the “Second-Worst Trade Of The Decade” award (Trent 3.0 for a first-rounder), the “Most Embarrassing NFL Owner Of 2014” award (a true achievement during the same year of Ray Rice/Steve Bisciotti) and the “AFC Playoff Team Everyone Is Excited To Wager Against The Most To The Point That They’d Be A Stealth ‘Nobody Believes In Us’ Candidate If They Weren’t So Fundamentally Limited” award. Q: Tennessee has become so irrelevant that there literally is not a single marketable human being on the team. I am praying for four years of Vince Young 2.0 (Jameis Winston) just so we will get mentioned in the national media. Can you name a more anonymous, less significant, less relevant team in the last decade than the 2014 Titans?
–Mike R., Chattanooga, TN BS: So the Jags have a rookie QB who looks like a 50-year-old Pete Sampras, an owner who looks like Ron Jeremy and a year of unfounded Jags-moving-to-London rumors … and those three things make them less anonymous and more relevant than the 2014 Titans? (Thinking.) Yeah, you’re right. Mike inspired me to visit NFL.com’s Titans Pro Shop to see which Titans jerseys were for sale. The first four jerseys they were hawking: no. 31, no. 82, no. 10 and no. 13. (Hold on, I’ll give you a second to guess the names … ) (Just a few more seconds … ) (And … time!) In reverse order … No. 13? Kendall Wright
No. 10? Jake Locker
No. 82? Delanie Walker
No. 31? Bernard Pollard That’s right, the no. 1 Titans jersey right now is Patriots dynasty assassin Bernard Karmell Pollard. YOU BURN IN HELL, TENNESSEE! BURN IN HELL! Saints (-4) over BUCS
At Stake: By losing, Tampa Bay wins the no. 1 overall pick (and the Marcus Mariota Sweepstakes) … there’s also a 1.05 percent chance that it’s Drew Brees’s last Saints game and a 17.8 percent chance that it’s Sean Payton’s last Saints game … oh, and don’t rule out Jimmy Graham catching 12 passes for 230 yards and three TDs as one last F.U. to every fantasy owner that he tormented this season. Q: Did any Saints fan not see that game-killing interception against Atlanta coming? I love Drew Brees — Actual Passer for the Most Yards in a Season, Counting Laterals as Runs — but it’s been a tough season for him with Game-Killing Interceptions (GKIs). Is 2013 Matt Schaub would be the standard by which all others are measured when it comes to determining a passer’s proclivity to completely derail all hopes of victory with a single, terrible decision; therefore it would be the “Schaub Rate”, or career game-killing interception rate. A touchdown need not be PART of the play  although, obviously, it helps to really wrench the dagger. I also think SKI’s — season-killers — should either be a separate stat entirely — we could call these “Delhommes.”
–Dan Bingler, Gainesville, FL BS: Finally, a worthy candidate to replace Roger Goodell — it’s Commissioner Dan Bingler! I loved all three of these ideas, although you should expand it to cover fumbles. Just call them Schaubs (for Game-Killing Turnovers) and Delhommes (for Season-Killing Turnovers). I’d also want to see a stat called a MoMur (Momentum Murderer), which covers any momentum-swinging second-half turnover along the lines of Brees’s Week 1 interception in Atlanta’s end zone (when the Saints were leading by three in the third quarter). On Monday night, Peyton Manning had four interceptions, including one MoMur (Adam Jones’s pick in Denver territory with 13:11 left to play) and one Schaub (Dre Kirkpatrick’s pick-six on an atrocious pass). In general, it drives me crazy that we don’t measure big-picture parts of games in more entertaining ways. I always thought the NBA needed a “Best Ball” award for every game — for the best player on the court in that specific game — just because I’d love to know at the end of every season who had the most Best Balls, which random players had the most Best Balls, and which great players over the course of history had the most all-time Best Balls and one-season Best Balls. I’d assume MJ from 1988 through 1993 had the greatest run of Best Balls ever. But who knows? I wish we knew. PS: This would work in football, too. PPS: I’m so proud of myself for laying off the Shawn Kemp/Antonio Cromartie joke here. Q: You mentioned in your Week 15 column that this year’s NFL Marcus Mariota tankapalooza nickname should be “Suck for the Duck.” I propose an alternative option: “JaMarcus for Marcus.” Doesn’t playing like JaMarcus Russell truly epitomize being the absolute worst you could possibly be? Any bad team can suck, but to “JaMarcus” is to take tanking to a whole new level.
–Scott, New York BS: I love it. Congrats in advance to Tampa for winning the “JaMarcus for Marcus” sweepstakes! I’m trying my best not to JaMarcus this column, by the way. Bears (+6.5) over VIKINGS
At Stake: The epilogue to Marc Trestman’s next book, “When Perseverance Met Jay Cutler.” Q: Wouldn’t it be just like Jay Cutler to come back for one game and play really well? We would end up with the 13th pick instead of the 8th pick, then we can spend eight months talking about how Cutler could be a good quarterback just with a different coach and OC. Then he can spend all of camp saying the right things and acting mature until the first sign of adversity and he will throw seven picks in three games and sink another season.
–Kevin, Pflugerville BS: And you wondered why I grabbed the points. Q: When I go to my in-laws for the holidays, I’m allowed/permitted/expected to get sloshed, right? Is there a single husband who doesn’t do this? And does it make a difference if my wife’s family doesn’t drink (they don’t)? I mean, I’ve only been doing this for five years, so I’m willing to change if I’m wrong. Please tell me I’m right.
–Neil V., Ottawa BS: Wait, you’re asking for my permission to get hammered when you’re a married guy hanging out with your sober in-laws in December in freezing-cold Ottawa? By the way, party at Neil’s in-laws’ house! PASS THE COURVOISIER!!!!! Jets (+5.5) over DOLPHINS
At Stake: Our last chance to enjoy Rex Ryan on the Jets’ sideline before he either replaces Mike Ditka on NFL Countdown, steals Phil Simms’s no. 1 job at CBS, bumps Bart Scott from CBS’s pregame show, signs with Grantland, becomes Bill Belichick’s new defensive coordinator or becomes the new head coach of the (pick one: Bears, Falcons, Raiders, Saints, Skins, Niners) … more important, this is NOT our last chance to wager against Joe Philbin. Q: On the BS Report a few weeks ago, you mentioned that football GMs should take into consideration what fans from rival teams want them to do, then do the opposite. As a Patriots fan, would you like to see Rex stay or go?
–Marc, Madison, WI BS: I hope the Jets are dumb enough to fire Rex — the guy who won them four road playoff games in two years even though Mark Freaking Sanchez was playing QB for him. We always hear that you’re only as good as your QB. Well, Rex’s starting QBs ranked 24th, 17th, 26th, 32nd, 28th and 30th in QBR from 2009 through 2014. During that time, the Jets never had a 1,000-yard receiver and only had three 1,000-yard running backs (Thomas Jones in 2009 and Shonn Greene in 2011 and 2012). In the past 12 years, the Jets have drafted one above-average skill position player … and it was a kick returner (Leon Washington in 2006). And this is Rex’s fault? Firing Rex and replacing him with Jim Schwartz or Greg Schiano would be the Jetsiest Jets moment since they tackled Delanie Walker to keep themselves from getting a top-two pick. Q: About twenty years ago, I was given a Christmas present by a extended family member. It was a 1/15th scale brass basketball hoop and backboard sort of … sculpture. I did not and never have played any form of organized basketball. I had no idea what to make of the gift, and thought that maybe it had some special meaning to the person who bought it for me. She did not acknowledge my thanks, only gave me a vacant glance. I decided that she had made a desperation purchase for me while sprinting through a mall, and dubbed it my Worst Christmas Gift Ever. That held true until today. Today, Stephen Ross said, “Here’s a Christmas present. You don’t have to ask me anymore. He has one year left on contract and is coming back.” He was, of course, speaking about Joe Philbin. I’m pretty sure I’m going to be right here at 8-7 next year, lamenting over another year lost in my life without seeing the Fins hoist a trophy. So … that’s my new Worst Christmas Present Ever. What’s yours?
–Chip Turner, Long Pond, PA BS: Without question, it’s The Godfather: Part III. They released it on Christmas Day in 1990, to tepid reviews that everyone refused to believe. I saw it that day with my stepfather, the world’s biggest Godfather fan; by the midway point, I had checked out while he kept imploring me to “Come on, give it a chance” and saying “It’s gonna get better, Coppola has this all planned out.” He was in total denial. It was like watching someone stand over a dead body after the sheet has already been pulled over it and saying, “It’s OK, it’s OK, he’ll be fine, he’s OK.” An hour later, we were stumbling out of the theater in holiday shock, only there wasn’t an Internet yet that allowed us to go on a message board to trash the script or Sofia Coppola’s performance. Bah humbug. PATRIOTS (-5) over Bills
At Stake: Nothing. By the way, thanks for the no. 1 seed, Peyton Manning! What a great gift! You shouldn’t have! Q: Is this the Year of the Mastermind Coach? Popovich, Bochy, Belichick, Saban, Mourinho, Calipari — when was the last time that all of the best teams were the best due to their coaching and their systems as much as the players’ talent?
–Corey, Pittsburgh BS: I like this point. All six guys you mentioned bring something historically unique to the table. Popovich’s Spurs team created the “Pace and Space” mind-set that’s transforming the NBA right now, and he invented a smarter way for contenders to use their extended benches so the regular-season grind doesn’t wear them out. Belichick’s year-after-year success during the Salary Cap era is impossible. Bochy won three titles in five years in a sport that’s a postseason crapshoot. Calipari mastered the One-And-Done Factory game plan. Saban conquered the SEC and created a dynasty in a sport that seemed dynasty-proof. My biggest gripe: including Mourinho (never won a 2014 title) over two-time Stanley Cup champ Darryl Sutter! How dare you!  Q: Thanks for getting my hopes up for nothing Buffalo. A week after beating upon Aaron Rodgers, the MVP front-runner, you blow a must-win game to Derek Carr. DEREK GODDANG CARR. And to make matters worse, a NFC South team is going to make the playoffs with a record below .500 this year. F–k football, I’m done.
–Sam, Plattsburgh, NY BS: Happy holidays to you, too, Sam! BRONCOS (-14.5) over Raiders
At Stake: Denver’s no. 2 seed (if Cincy loses, Denver gets the no. 2 seed anyway) … three more hours of people wondering, “Does Peyton look right?” … the puncher’s chance of an Oakland upset win saving the Tony Sparano era. Q: It’s official. Manning has lost it. Me and my buddy both took brutal beatings this Monday backing The Sheriff. Even doubled down at the half. The only thought I had watching the last few drives was “Please, please don’t throw it.” At which point I would see another duck, another INT and pick six, and another Manning face. Someone needs to point out that he’s not the same guy. The gamblers of America are counting on you.
–Rob, Milwaukee BS: I mean … SOMETHING is going on. First 8 Weeks, 2013: 2,919 yards, 29-6 TD/INT, 8.8 YPA, 119.4 rating
Last 8 Weeks, 2013: 2,558 yards, 26-4 TD/INT, 7.9 YPA, 110.7 rating
First 7 Weeks, 2014: 2,134 yards, 22-3 TD/INT, 8.5 YPA, 119.0 rating
Last 8 Weeks, 2014: 2,320 yards, 17-12 TD/INT, 7.5 YPA, 89.7 rating Two incredible follow-up points that I can’t believe I am even typing … 1. We’re indefinitely suspending the “Never bet against Peyton Manning in a night game” rule. Can’t retire it yet … but I can definitely suspend it. 2. Playoffs, cold weather, my beloved Pats hosting in Foxborough … and I’d rather see Denver come to town than Pittsburgh. I don’t know what to tell you. In the words of Selena Gomez, the heart wants what it wants. (And yes, you know I have a 9½-year-old daughter because I just quoted a Selena Gomez song.) GIANTS (-3) over Eagles
At Stake: Eli Manning locking down his best statistical season (highest passer rating, most TDs, best TD-INT ratio, second-highest passing yards, most PSA commercials where he stares blankly into a camera) … Mark Sanchez’s chances to ever start another NFL game … Philly joining the “9-3 to 9-7” Club … Philly Sports Radio moving from Defcon 3 to Defcon 2 with its “Maybe Chip Kelly ISN’T a genius” narrative … and Odell Beckham needing one more 150-yard/two-TD/one circus catch game to win the Offensive Rookie of the Year and officially become the no. 1 pick in 2015’s New York’s Most Beloved Professional Athlete draft. Q: Since the Eagles dropped out of the playoff picture, I think their fans should try and stay positive, right? Nothing helps me stay positive like this Boogie Nights clip.
–Zak Nelson, Baltimore  BS: I don’t think that worked. What about the Philly morning show anchor who read an indecent email on live TV without knowing it was obscene, culminating in her cohost trying to save the day by saying, “Hey, did you guys hear that the Eagles won?”  Rams (+12.5) over SEAHAWKS
At Stake: Seattle could clinch a no. 1 seed as long as there isn’t a Packers-Lions tie1 … Russell Wilson needs 164 passing yards and 58 rushing yards to join Randall Cunningham in the 3400/900-Yard Club … Jeff Fisher could clinch his third straight seven-win season … the number of fans who say to themselves, “Wait, Jeff Fisher only finished over .500 six times in 20 years????” could double. Q: I’m stoned watching this terrible Seattle-Arizona Sunday Night Football game and thought of this — whenever Richard Sherman gets an interception the announcers should yell “Dick pick!!!!!!”
–Dixon, Nashville BS: Yup … these are my readers. SKINS (+6.5) over Cowboys
Cards (+6) over 49ERS
At Stake: Arizona could clinch a no. 2 seed (if Seattle loses) and a no. 1 seed (if Seattle AND Green Bay lose)2 … Dallas could clinch a no. 2 seed if Seattle AND Arizona lose … Tony Romo could heat up his faint-but-heartwarming MVP chances … DeMarco Murray needs 27 more carries to reach 400 and earn his own “DON’T SIGN HIM!!!!” chapter in the 2015 Football Outsiders Almanac … one more quality RG3 game could suck D.C. fans back into the RG3 era (you know it’s true, too) … Cards fourth-string QB Logan Thomas could suck some people in, or he could just suck … this might be Jim Harbaugh’s last Niners game … oh, and the Cards could become the first playoff team to clinch home-field advantage while getting six points against a 7-8 team that has lost four straight. Q: Can we somehow get North Korea to believe that Dan Snyder wrote and financed The Interview?
–Tony, Baltimore BS: Congrats to Tony for being the 200th D.C. area football fan to send me this joke. Q: As a 49ers fan and season ticket holder, I still can’t believe the destruction that’s gone on after three consecutive NFC title games. And it’s only going to get worse because our owner for some reason thinks firing Jim Harbaugh is going to make us better. Does he forget what happened when we let go of Steve Mariucci and our team went into the shitter for a decade?
–Danny, Daly City BS: It’s insane. From September 2011 through 2013, Harbaugh won 36 of 48 regular-season games, won five of eight playoff games and came within a first down of winning the Super Bowl. And everything fell apart in 2014 — which wasn’t even remotely shocking when you factored in the Aldon Smith/Ray McDonald incidents, the aborted Harbaugh/Cleveland whatever-happened-there trade, their brutally competitive division and an unusually tough schedule. Here’s what I wrote in my “Year of the Dog” column before Week 1: “I love San Diego as 2014’s surprise 12-win contender, Tampa Bay as 2014’s “Nobody Believes In Us” sleeper, Baltimore as 2014’s comeback team, Cincy as 2014’s Slightly Undervalued Contender, and Minnesota as 2014’s super-frisky non-playoff team. I’m also waaaaaaaaay down on Carolina and Kansas City; I think the Falcons, Cardinals and Jets are worse than people think; I’m petrified of the QB situations in Buffalo, Houston and Washington; and I’m worried that San Francisco might have a Year From Hell Season.” Not bad! Oh, wait, I picked the 2-13 Bucs as a sleeper and declared 2014 the “Year of the Dog” even though favorites have covered at a higher success rate. Forget it. But a disappointing 2014 Niners season was always in play. And if Harbaugh is one of those withering, high-intensity, burns-you-out-after-three-years head coaches, then maybe college IS the best place for him. It’s just hard for me to believe that, just five months ago, Barnwell made Harbaugh the first coach to crack a Top 50 in the history of any Trade Value column … and now that coach is going to be more satisfied fleeing the NFL entirely so he could beat up on Northwestern and Purdue. Nick Saban wasn’t a very good pro football coach. Jim Harbaugh ia a SUPERB pro football coach. He’s overqualified for college. My take: I think he’s using that Michigan offer as leverage so that his next NFL team (Chicago, Atlanta, New Orleans, whomever) doesn’t have to pay a big ransom for him. And by the way, how much fun would a Sean Payton/Jim Harbaugh trade be? Can’t we just call that in now? Q: Isn’t the third string QB supposed to suck? It is not Ryan Lindley’s fault that he is not a good player. For every backup who becomes Brady, there are 1000 Lindleys. He deserves a break, as does Charlie Whitehurst and every Rams QB.
–James, Edison BS: This reminds me of an old Malcolm Gladwell riff — Ryan Lindley is something like the 62nd best professional quarterback in the world. In how many other jobs could you feel like a complete failure for being the 62nd best in the world at anything? Q: The Dallas Stars traded the Bruins a bag of urine for Tyler Seguin. The Dallas Mavericks traded the Celtics a pile of crap for Rajon Rondo. On behalf of Jerry and Stephen Jones, the Dallas Cowboys would like to offer you Gavin Escobar, Morris Claiborne, Lance Dunbar, and our 2015 2nd round pick for Rob Gronkowski and Brandon Browner. Thanks in advance.
–Owen, Austin BS: Too. Soon. CHIEFS (-2.5) over Chargers
At Stake: San Diego gets the no. 6 seed by winning … If Kansas City wins, they get the no. 6 seed if Baltimore AND Houston lose (good luck with that) … the 0-TD record for KC’s receivers … Phil Rivers needs one more come-from-behind win while battling eight different injuries and a herniated disc to grab Ben Roethlisberger’s “Toughest QB Alive” belt … K.C. fans are one more must-win defeat from feeling terrible about themselves again … speaking of K.C. fans feeling terrible, it’s the final installment of America’s favorite sports stadium game show, Wait, Should I Eat This? … and San Diego can break the “Most Centers Ever Used During One Season” record. Q; With four minutes to go, up by 11, and the Chiefs at midfield, my wife couldn’t figure out why I was so confident about the Steelers chances. I looked at her and just said, “Andy Reid.” At 3:30, and KC in field goal range, I started yelling, “An-Dee Reid” in the middle of my living room, as Andy continued to run 5-6 yard pass plays. Of course, as soon as the 2:00 warning passed, the field goal was kicked, the onside kick was lost, victory formation was run, and the Steelers move on. God Bless the Andy Reid School of Clock Management.
–Peter, Mohnton, PA BS: Also at stake — Andy Reid has a chance to lose one more big game. By the way, there’s a one-in-five chance that a Sloan Conference panel in two months will break down all the head-scratching decisions from this Chiefs-Chargers game. McCoy! Reid! It’s the Stamps.com Clock Management Fiasco Bowl at 1 p.m. on CBS! Q: Why would anyone name their penis after Odell Beckham, someone who is REALLY good at catching something? I would rather name my penis after the Chiefs WR corps, for safety’s sake.
–Josh, Brookline, MA BS: Random prediction: THIS IS THE WEEK! We’re gonna see a touchdown by a Chiefs receiver! I love the Chiefs this week. A SoCal team in cold weather, a truly banged-up Chargers squad, a half-empty Chiefs bandwagon, Mike McCoy doing Mike McCoy things, the free half-point from Vegas, the inevitable week when San Diego’s luck finally runs out,3 and best of all, the door opening just a crack for James Wattman to film Power Wattage 2 in the actual playoffs. Browns (+9.5) over RAVENS
TEXANS (-9.5) over Jaguars
At Stake: Baltimore’s win earns the no. 6 seed if San Diego loses … Houston’s win earns the no. 6 seed if Baltimore AND San Diego lose … Cleveland could land two top-15 picks if it loses and Buffalo loses … Baltimore could become only the ninth top-five DVOA team since 1991 to miss the playoffs … J.J. Watt could swing the MVP ballot with another monster game that ends with Watt doing everything short of pulling Blake Bortles’s arms off and clubbing him over the head with them … Jacksonville gets nothing and likes it.  Q: I was flipping through some article about what every state is worst at, and came upon this little gem: “Ohio: Worst water — Ohio came in dead last in a study of water cleanliness by the Natural Resources Defense Council.” So “there’s something in the water” might actually explain why Ohio’s professional sports teams never win anything. Add this to the “God hates Cleveland” theory.
–Adam, Knoxville BS: That’s the most interesting thing I learned about Cleveland after we posted that column. The second most interesting thing: In the Last Boy Scout clip that I posted, the pistol-packing running back plays for the L.A. Stallions and shoots defenders from the Cleveland Cats. Oh, and the actor playing that running back is Billy Blanks. So that’s a clip of the Tae Bo guy shooting Cleveland football players. Ladies and gentlemen, one more time, let’s hear it for Cleveland sports! Q: On this week’s B.S. Report it sounds like your MVP vote is going to J.J. Watt, with Rodgers, Brady, Wilson and Romo right after him. I’m just checking to see if you have a concussion.
–Danny in Trumbull, CT BS: I am not concussed. Passed the tests and everything. I don’t believe that any of the QBs grabbed the award — not even Rodgers, who put up 36 combined points against three of the top four defenses (Seattle, Detroit and Buffalo) and went 3-3 against his only six above-.500 opponents. Rodgers got to play the NFC South and four games against the Bears and Vikings. I think he’s the best QB in football. But he’s had better years — he didn’t WIN the award. Neither did Brady, Romo, Wilson or any other elite QB. Here’s a good rule of thumb from my NBA MVP reasoning: “Ten years from now, who will be the first player from this regular season that pops into my head?” Isn’t that J.J. Watt? Aren’t we going to be remembering this as the J.J. Watt season? According to Pro Football Focus’s numbers … Player A: 17.5 sacks, 43 hits, 49 hurries, 10 tipped passes, 56 stops Player B: 18 sacks, 11 hits, 53 hurries, 5 tipped passes, 46 stops Player A is J.J. Watt. Player B is the pooled-together stats for Justin Houston, Ndamukong Suh, Ryan Kerrigan, and Connor Barwin if you cherry-picked their highest possible totals.4 So J.J. Watt’s season is slightly better than the combined highest numbers of the next six guys. Oh, and he has 25 tackles for a loss, three forced fumbles, five fumble recoveries, an 80-yard interception TD (the longest by a defensive lineman in the past 10 years), a 45-yard fumble return TD and three TD catches.5 And he’s getting double-teamed pretty much all the time now. If you take him off Houston, it’s immediately a 3-13 team. On a personal note, he’s the best defensive player I have watched, game in and game out, since Lawrence Taylor (our last defensive player to win MVP). J.J. Watt wrecks offenses. He has also inspired me to write fake movie scripts, play out Thunderdome battles between him and Gronk, and seriously answer questions like “Would the Texans just be better off starting J.J. Watt at QB this weekend?” What else could he do? The 2014 Texans might miss the playoffs because they plowed through five mediocre-to-worse QBs (I’m counting both Ryan Fitzpatrick stints). There’s no other reason. Anyway, I think it comes down to this weekend: If Watt destroys Jacksonville, he steals my MVP vote unless Rodgers destroys Detroit at home. As for the no. 6 seed, I think K.C. wins, Houston wins, Baltimore barely holds on against Cleveland thanks to the Browns getting whistled for a record 37 penalties … and on Monday, Roger Goodell and Steve Bisciotti will play 18. PACKERS (-7.5) over Lions
At Stake: The NFC North title (and a no. 2 seed) … a possible no. 1 seed for Green Bay (if Seattle loses) or Detroit (if Seattle AND Arizona lose) … Detroit’s losing streak in Wisconsin (23 games!) … Aaron Rodgers’s MVP trophy … the collective psyche of Lions fans … my $200 parlay of the Packers -7.5 with “over 75.5 times” that someone on one of the ESPN/Fox/CBS shows calls suspended foot-stomping Lions center Dominic Raiola either “selfish” or “stupid” while also saying, “There’s no place in the game for that.” Q: I turned 30 a few months ago. If we beat Rodgers and break the Lambeau streak, it would be the greatest Lions victory since Erik Kramer torched the 1991 Cowboys. Be clever and phrase this as a mailbag question: I F—— NEED THIS SIMMONS. 
–JL, Birmingham BS: I think you nailed it, JL. Although I would have thrown in the obligatory “Do you know the Lions are 1-10 in the playoffs since 1958?” nugget. My fears for taking the Lions +7.5, in no particular order: Rodgers in Lambeau; Jim Caldwell; Stafford outdoors; Jim Caldwell a second time; no Raiola; all the Lions-Lambeau baggage; the 2014 Packers at home; the revenge factor from Week 2 (Lions 19, Packers 7); Jim Caldwell a third time; Stafford outdoors a second time. Q: You wrote: “If anyone can think of a more inept QB-coach combo this century, email it to me, please.” Mornhinweg and Harrington. That took like three f-ing seconds. Next time, if you want to know anything about failure and ineptitude in pro football, please, just ask a Lions fan first and save us all a lot of time.
–David Sparks, Chicago BS: And there’s that, too. By the way, here were your other “Most Inept QB-Coach of the Century” suggestions that trumped Cutler and Trestman … Honorable Mention: Pat Shurmur and Brandon Weeden; Dave Shula and David Klingler; Rod Marinelli and Jon Kitna/Dan Orlovsky; George Seifert and Chris Weinke; Chris Palmer and Spergon Wynn; Dick Jauron and Cade McNown; Cam Cameron and Cleo Lemon; JaMarcus Russell/Andrew Walter and Lane Kiffin/Tom Cable; Dave Campo and Quincy Carter; Curtis Painter and Jim Caldwell; Mike Singletary and Troy Smith; Brad Childress and Tarvaris Jackson; Marty Mornhinweg and Joey Harrington; Anyone and Romeo Crennel; Anyone and Dave Campo; Dom Capers and David Carr; Mike Mularkey and Blaine Gabbert. Bronze Medal: Danny in Santa Barbara writes, “I humbly submit to you the 2000 San Diego Chargers (1-15). Head coach — Mike Riley (career NFL record of 14-34); Ryan Leaf (nine starts), an aging Jim Harbaugh (!!!) (five starts), and something called a Moses Moreno (two starts). During a 17-7 loss to the Miami Dolphins in Week 11, all three managed to throw at least one interception.” Silver Medal: EZ Seibert in Nashville writes, “I am downright shocked that you didn’t even consider the combo of Greg Schiano and Josh Freeman. It only lasted three weeks in 2013, but in that time they had the MRSA outbreaks, rigged captain elections, leaked personal information, an inconceivable .457 completion percentage, and of course 0 wins. HAS to be in the discussion.” Gold Medal: Logan in Chesapeake, Virginia, asks, “What about the 2006 Raiders? The legendary Art Shell coached a combo of totally-washed-up Aaron Brooks and yes-that-was-a-real-NFL-QB Andrew Walter to a 2-14 record with 6 TDs and 21 picks. That’s not a typo, six touchdowns in sixteen games. Walter was the worse of the two: 8 starts, 3 TD, 13 INT, and an unconscionable QBR of 17.4. Cutler this year (55.0) is closer to Peyton’s QBR record season (87.2) than he is to 2006 Andrew Walter. Meanwhile, Art Shell was Art Shell and spent most of the season in an undiagnosed coma.” (Your winner: Art Shell, Andrew Walter and Aaron Brooks! I even wrote an Art Shell column that season AND followed it up with a reader email column. See, it could be worse, Bears fans. I have one word for you: Perseverance.) Q: The pure emotion in this video of Jim Caldwell’s postgame speech to the Lions is inspiring. If Calvin Johnson is Megatron, perhaps Jim Caldwell should be “Emoticon”? He actually ALMOST smiles when talking about the upcoming game with the Packers around the one minute mark!!!
–Terry, Grand Rapids, MI BS: Jim Caldwell speaks! Are we sure there aren’t two Jim Caldwells? Q: It’s time to set you straight on the MVP race. Don’t forget it’s the Most VALUABLE Player. If Nelson makes that catch in Buffalo, the Packers win and Rodgers’ numbers look A LOT better for that game. Did you realize that four of Rodgers’ five interceptions this year hit his receivers in the hands? HE’S THROWN ONE LEGITIMATE INTERCEPTION ALL YEAR.
–Trent, Mishawaka, IN BS: More from fellow Grantlander Steve Hyden, who happens to be a die-hard Packers fan … “If we compare Rodgers to Tom Brady, Rodgers has a significantly worse coach and no weapon as good as Rob Gronkowski. (Let’s not forget that Rodgers beat Brady head-to-head.) If we compare Rodgers to DeMarco Murray or Tony Romo, Rodgers wins because he doesn’t have a viable MVP candidate as a teammate. (Murray and Romo cancel each other out.) If we compare Rodgers to Russell Wilson, Rodgers has a significantly worse coach, a worse running back and a much worse defense. If we compare Rodgers to J.J. Watt, sorry, there is no comparison, because Rodgers makes an impact on every offensive play on a team with a much better record. Is there really a solid argument for any other player being more valuable to his team than Rodgers? He’s not just the MVP for 2014, he’s the MVP every year. While we’re at it, let’s also give him an Oscar, Emmy, Pulitzer, and Nobel [Prize].” Fine, fine, fine. It’s a defensible MVP pick. But Rodgers still needs to torch Detroit this weekend to make it official … right? FALCONS (-4) over Panthers
At Stake: The NFL’s dignity … the NFC South title (and the no. 4 seed) … the Mike Smith era … Cam Newton’s chances to get a nine-minute lump-in-the-throat produced segment about his car accident before a Round 1 playoff game that will definitely sample Peter Gabriel’s “Don’t Give Up” … a possible Atlanta Pro Sports Resurgence with the Falcons and the red-hot Hawks … our still-flickering chances for a Caldwell-Smith Clock Management Showdown in Round 2 … and don’t forget, we’re one Cam Newton hit away from getting a potential Ryan Lindley vs. Derek Anderson outdoors playoff matchup in Round 1.6 Q: Last week you said all NFC South Championship shirts should be immediately sent to Africa, because nobody would wear them anyway. As a Pats fan living in Charlotte, NC, I can safely say Carolina Panthers fans would without a doubt wear those championship shirts. 
–Trent C., Charlotte, NC Q: It would be silly to donate this year’s NFC South championship shirts to Africa. Send them to Brooklyn, where hipsters in Greenpoint and Bushwick will pay top dollar for the privilege of wearing them ironically.
–Chuck L, Brooklyn, NY BS: I like Chuck’s idea more. By the way, I absolutely love the Falcons in this game — they’re playing in the Georgia Dome, they’re 5-0 against division opponents, they have the league’s eighth-best offense according to DVOA, and they’ve covered six of their last eight games. They’re like the 2007 Pats of the NFC South. This line isn’t high enough. Q: How bummed are you that we won’t have a six-win NFC South champion hosting a playoff game, barring something crazy in Week 17 like Mike Smith mismanaging the clock leading to a tie and … wait a second. 
–Noah, New York, NY BS: You’re right, this line is probably high enough. STEELERS (-3.5) over Bengals
At Stake: Winner gets the AFC North title (and a no. 3 seed at least); loser gets the no. 5 seed (and the Colts) … Cincy could also win a no. 2 seed if Denver loses … Andy Dalton could officially shed the “Not Ready For Prime Time” tag … Pittsburgh could head into the playoffs 8-2 in its last 107 … Roethlisberger could reach 5,000 passing yards (he’s 365 yards away) and Antonio Brown could clinch the receiving yards title … if A.J. Green lasts four more quarters, somebody could give him an “I made it through a 17-week season without one of Andy’s throws seriously injuring me even though he almost broke my arm in the Denver game” T-shirt as a belated Christmas gift. Speaking of gifts, it’s time for me to unwrap your holiday present. (Waiting for you to open the box.) That’s right, it’s the Steelers at 18-to-1! Here’s the logic: I see them beating the Bengals and hosting Baltimore in Round 1. Perfect matchup — Roethlisberger can shred Baltimore’s secondary again like when he dropped six touchdowns on them in Week 9. After that, you have a Final Eight team with an experienced big-game QB that can drop 30-plus points on anyone. Could they win in Denver and New England? Why not? Denver looks vulnerable and Pittsburgh’s biggest weakness (giving up deep balls) happens to be the biggest weakness of New England’s offense.8 Heading into Week 17, Tom Brady has thrown deep 58 times, completed just 17 of those passes (34.5 percent — 19th in the NFL) for only five touchdowns (tied for 14th), and caused my dad to text me 27 times this season, either “GOD FORBID WE EVER COMPLETED ONE OF THESE” or “WHY DIDN’T WE SIGN STEVE SMITH???” I know, I know … that Denver/New England road gauntlet seems daunting. But you know what else is daunting? Old quarterbacks in bad weather. And you know what else is daunting? Road playoff teams with big-play receivers (the Steelers have three, including Antonio Brown, the league’s best receiver), a big-play running back (Le’Veon Bell is the scariest back in football right now) and a gunslinger QB. As a die-hard Patriots fan who genuinely likes my team’s chances this season, still, I am abjectly terrified of Pittsburgh. Do I believe the Steelers will beat Denver, New England AND Seattle back-to-back? Not necessarily … but I believe they COULD. And that’s why you should grab them at 18-to-1 — because those are really good odds for “they COULD.” Merry Christmas. (Oh, and Steelers fans? You don’t have to send me “I know what you’re doing — this is one of those patented Simmons reverse jinxes!” emails. That goes without saying!!!! Merry Christmas to myself for reverse-jinxing the Steelers! WOO-HOO! ENJOY THE SIMMONS STINK, PITTSBURGH!!!!! And happy holidays, everybody.) Last Week: 9-6-1

192,NBA Bag: 10 Steps to Tanking Perfection," Editor’s note: Every Wednesday from now until the final day of the regular season (April 16), I am cranking out an all-NBA mailbag for the Triangle with a 5,000-word limit. As always, these are actual emails from actual readers. We’re tackling only one this week. Q: What are the odds that the Sixers finish their season on a 36-game losing streak? They’re at 15 already with 21 games to go. They put two actual NBA players on the floor each night, and things are so bad that I just thought about whether or not Byron Mullens is an actual NBA player. Is there a chance for L36? — Jack, Philly SG: The short answer … YES! You know how Lance Armstrong was the greatest cheater ever? How he blended his commendable charity work with state-of-the-art science and relentless lying to pull an ongoing Jedi mind trick on the American public? The 2013-14 Sixers have a chance to go down as the greatest NBA self-sabotagers ever. They haven’t been tanking games as much as obliterating any chance of winning them. And they’re doing it because the NBA gives every team the same loophole … If you want to throw away a season, depress your fans and disgrace the league for a 25 percent chance at the no. 1 pick and a 100 percent chance at a top-four pick … knock yourself out! The Sixers know they’re better off bottoming out in the grisliest way possible, so they’re owning it — they’ve done everything short of signing Kevin Hart and Allen Iverson’s mom to 10-day contracts. And those moves might be coming next week. Would anything shock you? Look at the self-sabotage blueprint that Philly’s new owners and GM Sam Hinkie have followed. Step 1: Trade your best player for future assets if you don’t feel like he can be the best player on a championship team. And that was a GREAT trade: Jrue Holiday for 2013’s no. 6 pick (Nerlens Noel) and New Orleans’s top-five protected first-rounder in 2014. Thanks to New Orleans’s struggles, Philly has an excellent chance of landing two top-10 picks in a deep 2014 draft; more important, they improved their own 2014 lottery chances by turning 82 games of Holiday into zero games of the already-injured Noel. A crucial part of self-sabotage: maiming yourself in the short term. You don’t want to sorta suck or kinda suck in the NBA. You want to suck all kinds of suck. (Important note: I loved that trade last summer and love it even more now that New Orleans is flopping in the West. Philly got somewhere between 130 and 200 cents on the dollar, depending on where that second pick lands, for someone who wasn’t a franchise player. I love Rajon Rondo, but if the Celtics got a Holiday-like offer for him, I’d be packing his bags and his leather Connect Four case for him.) Step 2: Don’t sign anyone who can help you, even if it means dipping under the salary-cap floor and going down as the cheapest NBA team ever. What’s the point of signing veterans like Jarrett Jack, Carl Landry, and Shaun Livingston in July just because you have the extra money? So they can tie up your cap, give you depth, make you a few wins better, take young players under their wing and maybe even teach them good work habits and professional behavior and all that overrated stuff? Screw that! Fill your bench with unproven young guys, failed draft picks and fringe bodies who make you say things like, “Wait, wasn’t that the dude on Jimmer’s BYU team who got suspended for getting laid?” and, “Is that the same Jarvis Varnado who was on Miami, or is this another Jarvis Varnado?” Step 3: Don’t get discouraged if you win early. Philly started out 5-4 for two reasons: Michael Carter-Williams was better than everyone expected, and its three holdovers (Thad Young, Evan Turner and Spencer Hawes) clicked in a surprisingly entertaining way. The Sixers handled it perfectly — never celebrating, never improving their roster and allowing Young-Turner-Hawes to be thrown in every conceivable trade rumor without ever saying, “We kinda like what we have here … change of plans!” By January, Carter-Williams was developing poor habits and learning to lose. Young was asking for a trade. And Hawes was mailing in games and carrying himself like the star of a hostage video. Well played, Philly. Step 4: If you can’t get fair value for your trade assets, trade them anyway. Before the deadline, Philly gave away Turner, Hawes and Lavoy Allen for three second-round picks, two expiring contracts they immediately bought out (Danny Granger and Earl Clark) and the immortal Henry Sims. People get carried away with second-round picks because they’re cost-effective assets if you nail them, but recent history says you have about a 10 percent chance of landing a rotation player from picks 31 to 40. (Since 2009, only Draymond Green, Kyle Singler, Chandler Parsons, Lance Stephenson, DeJuan Blair and MAYBE Nate Wolters came through.) After that, you’d have a better chance of hearing someone say the words, “I think what James Dolan is doing is really smart … ” By stockpiling second-rounders (five in all), Philly gave itself a puncher’s chance of landing someone who, someday, might be 80 percent as good as Spencer Hawes. Congratulations! But that’s a self-sabotage staple — you’re not throwing games, just making it impossible to win. Hawes and Turner needed to go. Step 5: If you can affect the playoff race just to be dicks, even better. Philly gift-wrapped Turner and Allen for Larry Legend for 10 cents on the dollar. Then, the Sixers bought out Granger to save $500K over keeping his sign-and-trade rights and hoping one of the league’s most respected veterans affected Carter-Williams in a positive way. Granger signed with the Clippers, meaning Philly potentially improved two of the league’s five best teams. (Note: I still think Granger has a salad fork sticking out of his back. We will see.) If someone made those two moves in your fantasy league, it would ignite a 125-email chain that included snarky insults, obscenities in all caps and semi-threats like, “Why don’t you drive over to my office right now and say that to my face?” When the Sixers do it? Totally fine. The NBA enables this behavior — there’s no trade committee, no “spirit of the league” rule, nothing. So, why not? Step 6: Trade for Byron Mullens. Thanks to a Latvian reader named Reinis for pointing this out: Byron Mullens is really the Olivia Pope of NBA self-sabotage. First, he has the experience — Mullens was the LVP of that unforgettably wretched 7-59 Bobcats team. When Charlotte dropped 23 straight to end its 2012 saboteurium, Lord Byron was giving them 27.2 horrendous minutes a night. The man knows what he’s doing. Nice guy? Absolutely. Could he be your 12th man? Sure! But if you’re riding him for big minutes, you’re riding a center who doesn’t protect the rim, rebound, defend or draw a double-team. You’re riding a sabermetic eyesore. You’re riding a 3-point specialist who can’t actually make 3-pointers.  Believe me, if you’re throwing away your season, you want Byron Mullens involved. Even with the Clips pushing to dump Mullens to open up a roster spot, Philly still traded a second-round pick to get him. He ended up fetching one fewer second-round pick than Spencer Hawes did! Has there ever been a better self-sabotage move? It was like the 1987 Lakers landing Mychal Thompson, only the exact opposite. Step 7: Come up with a fake injury for any good player and/or milk the recovery time of any existing injury. Here’s an interesting blueprint dilemma for Philly — only Carter-Williams can cost them a couple of losses (by playing too well), but the Sixers want MCW to win Rookie of the Year so that SOMETHING good comes out of this season. You know, because voters are dying to reward the best guy on a team that just lost 36 straight. Let’s send him a trophy and a car! Well done, my friend! The case for not shelving Williams with a bogus injury: He feeds into the self-sabotage as long as he’s forcing too many plays and cheating for steals over actually playing defense. Have you watched him lately? Yikes. That’s what happens when you enable an impressionable kid and allow him to chase the Rookie of the Year award over trying to win games. Anyway, you could make a strong case for keeping MCW out there. Hold this thought, we’re coming back to it in Step 10. Step 8: Give tons of minutes to young players who aren’t ready for them, and come up with as many doomed/goofy/ridiculous lineups as possible. Two sentences are your buddies here: “We think he has potential, and we want to see what we have here,” and, “We want to get a little more creative with our lineups and see if anything works.” Both are unequivocal lies. Whatever. If the Celtics landed Kevin Durant in 2007, do you think Boston fans would care seven years later that we played Allan Ray too much, or that Young Gerald Green had the green light to shoot from any spot on the floor, or that we played two and three point guards together at the same time? Again, we repeatedly played Delonte West, Rajon Rondo and Sebastian Telfair together at the same time. This actually happened. Within a few months, we had KG and Ray Allen and nobody cared. Sixers fans won’t care in six months, either. Assuming there are still Sixers fans. That reminds me … Step 9: Make a big deal about discounting next season’s tickets as a thank-you to your loyal season-ticket holders who paid full price for an 82-game season that you just threw away. Whoops — the Sixers went the opposite way! My bad. Before Allen Iverson’s jersey retirement ceremony last weekend, they enticed fans to buy 2014-15 season tickets with a thrilling offer: Get your tickets now and you can have your picture taken in front of Iverson’s no. 3 banner, then one of his bodyguards or flunkies Iverson will autograph that photo at a later date. They even called it “an exclusive opportunity.” You mean, more exclusive than paying full price for a D-League team with a genuine chance to finish zero for its last 36? Maybe they could have Tony Wroten autograph an “exclusive” picture of a disgustingly clogged toilet to commemorate their 29-point home shellacking to Cleveland last month. (The good news: The Sixers still have time to rectify this mistake. What about giving your loyal peeps a sorry-about-everything discount for 2015, you dumbasses? Or would that make too much sense?) Step 10: Weigh the benefits of self-sabotage against the long-term damage to your most valuable asset. Philly has a solid chance of passing Milwaukee for the Quadruple P (Ping-Pong Pole Position). The Sixers are only one loss behind, with no plans of ever winning again. But they shouldn’t ruin Carter-Williams to do it. In 1997, I watched M.L. Carr irrevocably alter Antoine Walker’s career with that same “Rookie of the Year on a Crap Team” carrot. As the Celtics threw away their last two months for Duncan ping-pong balls, they had Antoine playing out of position at center, hogging the ball, chasing his own numbers and learning horrendous habits. At the time, I was living in Boston and hitting most of those games because my dad steadfastly refused to go. Trust me: Antoine was only 20 years old, and he NEVER recovered from those two months. He learned all the wrong things. All of them. Well, the same thing is happening to Carter-Williams right now. He might be special, he might never get there … who knows? He’s a fantastic athlete with size, and someone who quickly adapted to the speed of the NBA game and belonged from day one. Could he have the career that we always wanted Shaun Livingston to have — just a slew of 22-9-12’s on a series of entertaining teams? Of course. But he’s also a genuinely dreadful outside shooter (see Kirk Goldsberry’s shot chart below), and he’s a little older than you think (at 22, he’s actually five months older than Kyrie Irving). We learned this the hard way with poor Ricky Rubio: Sometimes your outside shot is broken, and that’s just the way it is.  Regardless, here’s an undeniable fact: Carter-Williams played much better in 2013 (8-11 record, 17.8 PPG, 7.5 APG, 5.5 RPG, 3.1 SPG, 41% FG, 31% 3FG) than he has played in 2014 as the team has gone into self-sabotage mode (6-24 record, 16.5 PPG, 5.4 APG, 5.3 RPG, 1.3 SPG, 38% FG, 24% 3FG). That’s a problem. They’re better off punting on Rookie of the Year, coming up with a bogus injury and keeping him away from the team’s festering stink. There are no good lessons from intentionally getting your asses kicked every night. Last night, the Sixers lost by 33 in Oklahoma City as Russell Westbrook finished with a triple-double in 20 minutes. Twenty minutes! Um, how is that helping Carter-Williams? Philly’s easiest remaining games: Utah, @Knicks, Sacramento, Knicks, Detroit, @Atlanta, @Boston, Boston, Game 82 at Miami (against Miami’s second string). You’re damned right 0-36 is in play. Meanwhile, Milwaukee, Utah and Orlando are their self-sabotage partners, although they haven’t been quite as blatant (ironically, the bumbling Bucks actually TRIED to be good). Utah, Sacramento, Boston and the Lakers will start to smell a little gamey soon. The disappointing Pelicans want to keep that top-five-protected pick, which means (a) get ready for the bogus Anthony Davis injury soon, and (b) we might be getting a lot of Austin Rivers down the stretch. Maybe even 40 minutes a night. We might have to stick paramedics near Haralabob Voulgaris at all times. (What a shame that we can’t watch Rivers and Mullens on the same team running pick-and-rolls.) And don’t sleep on Atlanta throwing its season away (already happening) or Denver doing the same (about to happen). Ladies and gentlemen, that’s our biggest Tankapalooza field ever: one-third of the league! Does Adam Silver care? Does he want to repair this? I’ve already suggested fixes in 2007 (the Entertaining As Hell Tournament), 2009 (in an exchange with Gladwell on how to fix the NBA draft) and 2011 (tweak on the same tournament idea). Grantland’s Zach Lowe wrote about Mike Zarren’s concept of a lottery wheel three months ago. I mean, if the NBA has a relocation committee and a media rights committee, wouldn’t it make sense to create a For the Good of the Game committee? We have too many teams (that’s never changing), a season that’s too long (that could easily be fixed) and far too much incentive for non-contenders to intentionally fail (that can DEFINITELY be fixed). We also don’t have any penalties in place — not even something as simple as, “If you lose 90 percent of your games for any 35-game stretch during a season, your season-ticket holders receive a 30 percent discount for the following season.” Would we see as much self-sabotage if the owners’ wallets were involved? Somehow I doubt it. Two weeks ago, I wondered about the best way for an NBA general manager to make sure he stays employed for four to five years. “The answer: Blow everything up, bottom out, build around young players/cap space/lottery picks, make a bunch of first-round picks, and sell the ‘illusion of hope’ to your fans. I’d like to see people in other professions try this.” As a San Francisco reader named Aziz pointed out, I inadvertently “described the private equity business model. Take over a bloated company, load it up with debt, dump assets, cut research & development, and basically guarantee the company can’t do anything innovative for a decade. Once the debt is paid off, you have a company with nice free cash flow (‘cap space’). And guess what? Many NBA teams are now owned by private equity or venture capital investors, including some of our most unapologetic tankers.” One of them? Philly’s Josh Harris. Hmmmmmm. Could there be a correlation? And why would the NBA want any correlation? The league’s creative paralysis from 2008 through 2013 had a built-in excuse: David Stern stayed five years too long. He only allowed innovation that involved the words “digital” or “international.” He stopped taking chances, stopped thinking outside the box, stopped trying to grow the game domestically. He bristled anytime someone questioned him, held on to petty grudges, bullied people behind the scenes and protected the wrong people. Stern executed his own kind of blueprint: the Here’s What Happens When You Stay Too Long blueprint. Even his “retirement” lasted an absurdly long time: nearly 18 months in all, as Stern chased and conquered Pete Rozelle’s meaningless “longest tenure by a commissioner” record. He should have exited last June — after an incredible Finals and a bizarrely entertaining draft in Brooklyn — in what could have been something of a victory lap. Instead, he hung around for eight more awkward months. Everyone assumed that Stern would stay as the league’s unofficial international ambassador, feasting on a cushy gig that allowed him to traipse around the world (India, China, Australia — you name it), while pushing the sport abroad. That job never materialized. The dirty secret of Stern’s last 18 months was that, as much as the 30 owners respected him, they also believed it was time for him to leave. And somehow, the smartest guy in the room was the last guy who realized it. Adam Silver’s first month in charge was distinguished mostly by how hastily Silver distanced himself from his old mentor. Many of Stern’s administrative cronies had already been forced out, and Stern’s surprising absence from All-Star Weekend in New Orleans wasn’t exactly random. A new generation has emerged behind the scenes, with Silver flanked by new assistant commish Mark Tatum (a beloved hire), NBA Entertainment honcho Danny Meiseles, merchandising guru Sal LaRocca, global media head Bill Koenig, and Adam’s right-hand man, Jarad Franzreb, among others. The current group of owners with the most influence — ranging from the old guard (Peter Holt and the Reinsdorfs) to the newer old guard (Stan Kroenke, James Dolan, Wyc Grousbeck, Mark Cuban, Ted Leonsis) to the new guys (Vivek Ranadive, Joe Lacob) — all believe in Silver and have his back, both publicly and privately. They like the guy. That’s not a sentence you heard about David Stern very often. Truth be told, Stern would have stayed in office even longer if some of those owners hadn’t gently nudged him out. With a monster television deal coming, digital content booming and live events becoming the most valuable media rights property — especially with multiple 24-hour sports networks and local cable superstations that need hundreds of hours of airtime to fill — the league itself has never been stronger. It didn’t just win the last collective bargaining agreement; it destroyed the players and checkmated a fractured union. Do you realize that Brian McCann signed for more guaranteed money this winter than LeBron’s last contract? It’s no accident that, other than maybe Milwaukee, ZERO professional basketball teams are for sale. Seattle has two billionaires willing to double the sticker price for a handful of the 30 teams; nobody is biting. Throw in LeBron and Durant — the best rivalry, potentially, since Bird and Magic — and all the other star-studded contenders, and it’s an amazing time to run a basketball league. Silver and his owners believe that there’s a real window here — thanks to the concussion crisis in football and the execrable length of baseball games — for the NBA to seize the reins and become America’s new pastime. There’s a reason the new commish mentioned this publicly more than once. His owners want to hear a little less about “growing the sport abroad” and a little more about “building the sport domestically.” Other than the way he treated people and carried himself, that was their single biggest issue with Stern. And that’s why this tanking bullshit matters. When 36 percent of your league is willfully throwing away the last five weeks of an 82-game season, you’re doing something wrong. Stern stuck his head in the sand. He pretended self-sabotage wasn’t a recurring danger, just like he pretended the broken officiating system was fine … and the always-disappointing All-Star Saturday was fine … and the annoying 2-3-2 Finals format was fine … and the stunning lack of minority league executives at every CBA bargaining table was fine … and the embarrassing Chris Paul trade veto was fine … and The Decision was fine … and the Maloofs destroying basketball in Sacramento to the point that the fans had to revolt was fine … and Clay Bennett extorting Seattle for a new arena and ultimately hijacking the team was fine … and the league owning the New Orleans franchise as it landed the no. 1 overall pick was fine … and starting off Silver’s commissioner transition by hovering over him for an extra eight months was fine. I don’t think Adam Silver wants to stick his head in the sand. I really don’t. But conquering the self-sabotage corner is a good place for him to start. This isn’t tanking. Nobody is throwing games. They’re just shitting on them. And they’re doing it because it’s the smartest thing to do. Don’t pretend this is fine. It’s not.",2014-03-05T14:24:28+00:00,NBA,Simmons
193,Are Manning and Brady Cheating? How Rule Changes Have Helped Extend a Rivalry,"Did you enjoy the misleading headline we came up with to generate traffic and rig Google results, only it’s a complete misrepresentation from what I wrote this week? What a farce, right? We’ll never do that again, right? Websites rarely pulled those shenanigans in 2002, but in 2014, they do it all the time. Things evolve … and conversely, things devolve. Just look at football. Earlier this century, ESPN’s NFL studio show aired a weekly segment called “Jacked Up” that celebrated every time a player got demolished by a tackle. Earlier this century, NFL fans believed you won Super Bowls with defense and running backs. Earlier this century, an NFL commissioner suspended a player two games for knocking his fiancée out cold in an elevator, then changed the length of that suspension a few weeks later without any new facts and without anyone thinking this was illegal. Fine, that last example didn’t work. The point is — THINGS CHANGE. So when I receive a mailbag question like this one from RK in Nashville: “How about Collinsworth’s quote in MMQB? ‘Here’s the amazing thing about Peyton Manning: He’s an ascending player at the age of, what, 38 years old? I have never seen a great player on that level ascending at that age.’ If this quote doesn’t make the mailbag then that tells me your testicles are resting in a glass jar and being guarded somewhere in Bristol.” … part of me wants to defend the immortal Mr. Manning, part of me cringes at the thought of my testicles living in a glass jar, part of me cringes for the security guard in this scenario, and part of me wants me to click over to Baseball-Reference.com to confirm that, yes, 38-year-old Barry Bonds DID hit a career-high .370 with 46 homers and a 1.381 OPS. Cris Collinsworth is totally right. He’s also totally wrong. Peyton Manning IS getting better at playing regular-season professional football. Check out his pre-2013 career highs for every major passing category versus his numbers in 2013 and 2014 (through seven games): Highs: 4,700 yards, 49 TDs, 9 INTs, 9.17 YPA, 87.2 QBR,1 121.1 rating. 2013: 5,477 yards, 55 TDs, 10 INTs, 8.32 YPA, 82.9 QBR, 115.1 rating. 2014: 2,134 yards,2 22 TDs, 3 INTs, 8.47 YPA, 90.1 QBR, 119.0 rating. But Manning is also getting worse at playing football. His post-surgery noodle arm transformed into Greg Maddux The QB — less velocity, better precision. He paints the plate with every throw. He keeps defying his aging body’s inherent limitations. It’s been astounding to watch. We beat every story line into the ground these days, to the point that we can’t even see some of them clearly because we spent so much time beating them. Just look at LeBron’s “homecoming,” relentlessly marketed as a back-to-Cleveland decision when it was really a basketball decision. (Anyone who thinks LeBron was “coming home” in his prime to a team that didn’t have Kevin Love and/or a chance to win titles immediately is fooling themselves.) In Manning’s case, his triumphant return from four neck surgeries was beaten into the ground, but now it’s glossed over because everyone already knows the story. He’s not the same physically, and it just doesn’t matter. At least in the regular season. So why does it SEEM like Peyton Manning is still “ascending,” as Collinsworth said? Because the rules kept drifting in his favor, yet another sports topic that was pummeled into the ground and now gets taken for granted. You can’t hit QBs high, you can’t hit QBs low, you can’t hit QBs within 0.25 seconds after they’ve released the football, and it’s unclear whether you can even make a mean face at them. Remember when QBs were injured all the time? Remember when you NEEDED a backup QB? These are better and safer times — and they should be — but quarterbacks don’t get injured anymore unless it’s a freak injury (RG3 earlier this season), a freak hit (Romo on Monday night) or an unexpected concussion (which we’re diagnosing much better these days). You also can’t handcheck receivers, touch them after five yards, head-hunt over the middle or hit them when they’re defenseless. It’s much, much, much easier to throw and catch the football. Check this out: Yards Per Game: 2002: 0 QBs over 300, one over 275, four over 250 2006: 0 QBs over 300, one over 275, six over 250 2010: 0 QBs over 300, four over 275, 10 over 250 2014: 3 QBs over 300, 11 over 275, 15 over 250 ESPN’s QBR: 2006: 1 QB over 75, one over 69, eight over 60, 14 over 50 2010: 1 QB over 75, four over 69, 11 over 60, 15 over 50 2014: 6 QBs over 75, nine over 69, 16 over 60, 24 over 50 The performances of 38-year-old Barry Bonds and so many other baseball stars from that era were enhanced because, you know, they took performance enhancers. Maybe it didn’t totally make sense in the moment. And maybe we were worried someone was going to grow Jay Leno’s chin or break out the first ever size-12 baseball cap. But it certainly makes sense after the fact. The recent performances of Manning and Brady (one year younger) have been enhanced in a different way. Passing rules changed so dramatically that it threw everyone’s numbers out of whack. Imagine figuring out the last eight years of NBA numbers if, in 2006, the league moved the 3-point line to 20 feet, allowed offensive goaltending and made it legal to take three steps after a dribble. (Well, MORE legal.) That’s basically what happened in the NFL. Just look at the best Brady/Manning seasons in three-year quadrants: 1999-2001, 2002-04, 2005-07, 2008-10, 2011-13, then 2014 (eight starts for Brady, seven starts for Manning).3 2000 Manning: 4,413 yards, 33-15 TD-INT, 7.73 YPA, 94.7 rating
2001 Brady: 2,843 yards, 18-12 TD-INT, 6.88 YPA, 86.5 rating 2004 Manning: 4,557 yards, 49-10 TD-INT, 9.17 YPA, 121.1 rating
2004 Brady: 3,692 yards, 28-14 TD-INT, 7.79 YPA, 92.6 rating 2006 Manning: 4,397 yards, 31-9 TD-INT, 7.89 YPA, 101.0 rating, 87.2 QBR
2007 Brady: 4,806 yards, 50-8 TD-INT, 8.32 YPA, 117.2 rating, 87.1 QBR 2009 Manning: 4,500 yards, 33-16 TD-INT, 7.88 YPA, 99.9 rating, 82.8 QBR
2010 Brady: 3,900 yards, 36-4 TD-INT, 7.93 YPA, 111.0 rating, 77.0 QBR 2013 Manning: 5,477 yards, 55-10 TD-INT, 8.31 YPA, 115.1 rating, 82.9 QBR
2011 Brady: 5,235 yards, 39-12 TD-INT, 8.57 YPA, 105.6 rating, 73.0 QBR 2014 Manning: 2,134 yards, 22-3 TD-INT, 8.47 YPA, 119.0 rating, 90.1 QBR
2014 Brady: 2,059 yards, 18-2 TD-INT, 7.33 YPA, 104.7 rating, 75.4 QBR Instead of PEDs, they were injecting QB-friendly rules into their bodies. And it has reinvented a rivalry that … A. Would have gone down as the NFL’s Russell-Chamberlain battle even if Manning retired in 2011. B. Has seen both players grab the invisible “lead” multiple times. C. Means infinitely more to fans and media members then it does to either of them. (I wrote about that theme in the 2010 season.) It’s hard to imagine Manning squandering pole position at this point; his recent Denver resurgence coupled with his touchdown records — season and career, his MVP awards (five), his win-loss record (173-74) and the career passing yard record (it’s coming) make him the most successful QB ever by any calculation. But only 30 months ago, when Manning’s career hung in the balance during the spring of 2012, Brady owned the Manning/Brady championship belt. He had just appeared in his fifth Super Bowl, thrown for over 6,000 yards (including playoffs) and sat on a career record of 124-35 (regular season), 16-6 (playoffs), one 16-0 season and three Lombardis. And in my opinion, he could have kept the belt had he been wired just a little differently. (WARNING! One of my ridiculous theories is coming.) (Repeat: It’s just a theory. Brace yourself.) Growing up, Manning was the son of a famous QB, the overachieving middle brother, the eventual golden boy, someone who always had something to prove. Ever seen three little brothers hanging out together? They’re fighting and competing all the time. It never ends. It’s a constant battle for the upper hand. Eventually, one of them wins it. That was Peyton. He spent his childhood ordering Eli around, and he spent his football career ordering everyone else around. Remember when he whipped out watermelon-size balls by shockingly signing with Tennessee over Ole Miss (his father’s alma mater)? That set the tone for everything that followed: Peyton wanted the best possible situation at all times. It can’t be a coincidence that, for the vast majority of his 16-year career, he’s been flanked by legitimate weapons. Manning would never be happy playing for a team that didn’t allow him real input — not just the weapons on hand, but the offensive scheme itself. And by all accounts, everyone loves working with him. He’s a great teammate. But he’s also in charge. All the time. That was Wes Welker’s biggest takeaway after playing with Brady and Manning. He told friends that while both players were incredible — for many of the same reasons (work ethic, competitiveness, likability, etc.) — he couldn’t believe how in charge Manning is. In New England, Bill Belichick’s fingerprints were everywhere; Brady had significant input, but still, he worked for Belichick (and not vice versa). In Denver, Manning’s fingerprints are everywhere. He tells the front office what he needs/wants; he tells the offensive coordinator what system he wants to run; he runs meetings; he orders people around in the locker room; he does everything. Welker, who always bristled at Belichick’s authoritarian nature, wondered if the Patriots would be better off had Brady been given that same leadership leash. Then again, you have to fight for that level of input. And Brady grew up differently than Manning … as the baby brother of three older sisters. Repeat: THREE OLDER SISTERS. I have two children — a 9½-year-old daughter and a son who turns 7 this weekend. My daughter OWNS my son. They might be best friends, but they do what she wants to do 95 percent of the time. She orders him around like they’ve been married for 30 years. And it’s not just my house — I am still waiting to meet the family with the older daughter or daughters whose youngest son runs the show. Doesn’t make the son less competitive. Doesn’t mean he has a greater chance of failing as an athlete. Just means that, fundamentally, he spent the majority of his time agreeing, nodding and following. If you’re a little boy with an older sister, she owns your ass. (See? I told you this was one of my most ludicrous theories! I swear, I believe in this one 100 percent.) But THREE older sisters who also happened to be terrific at sports? According to a 2012 Yahoo.com piece called “Sister Pact,” Brady remembers, “They were the best athletes in my house — certainly a better athlete than I ever was. I just loved tagging along and I was living and dying with every loss they had.” Read that Yahoo piece and you come away thinking, Wow, that’s really the All-American family. But could you say that Brady, for 15 seasons and counting in New England, is still tagging along to some degree? If you believe Belichick and Bob Kraft took the Brady era for granted — especially these last few years — you wouldn’t be wrong. Because they did. Especially the last third of Brady’s career. (We’ll get to this later.) But if you believe that, you also have to believe that Brady allowed it to happen. His best quality? He puts the team ahead of himself at all times. His worst quality? He puts the team ahead of himself at all times. Like every other Boston fan, I always wondered why Brady wouldn’t rebel publicly every time the Patriots screwed him over with his “weapons.” He won his first Super Bowl throwing to Troy Brown (superb that season), David Patten and Jermaine Wiggins. In 2003 and 2004, he won two more Super Bowls without any Patriots receiver catching 60 passes or tallying more than 900 yards in either season. From a career standpoint, it’s the worst thing that ever happened to Brady. It made Belichick believe, for better and worse, that the 53-man roster mattered more than riding a once-in-a-lifetime QB. If Brady could win three Super Bowls without any dangerous weapons, then that could keep happening … right? But here’s where Belichick — one of the great football coaches ever, and the best Boston coach of my lifetime — kinda sorta maybe screwed up. The Patriots traded Deion Branch for a first-round pick in 2006, leaving Reche Caldwell (760 yards), Ben Watson (643 yards), Troy Brown (384 yards) and Kevin Faulk (356 yards) as Brady’s top four receivers.4 The ’06 Patriots blew an 18-point lead in the AFC title game and failed to convert a game-clinching third-and-4 because, again, Brady’s top targets were Caldwell, Watson, Faulk and a washed-up Troy Brown. So there’s one Super Bowl they absolutely gave away.5 Belichick atoned with an uncharacteristically brazen Welker/Randy Moss/Donte’ Stallworth/Sammy Morris transaction spree, the only time New England ever definitively said, “WE HAVE TOM BRADY ON OUR TEAM AND WE ARE TAKING ABSOLUTE ADVANTAGE OF THIS!” Also not helping: From 2003 through 2009, Belichick whiffed every time he spent a high draft pick on a “weapon,” whether it was Bethel Johnson, Ben Watson, Chad Jackson, Laurence Maroney, David Thomas, Brandon Tate or OhmygodIwanttoslammyheadagainstthewall.6 Everything flipped in 2010 (the Gronk/Hernandez draft), although the Patriots blew that February 2012 Super Bowl partly because Gronkowski was hobbled and Belichick never splurged on a reliable second receiver. I have two enduring images from that game: Welker sliding into open territory for a game-clinching TD and Brady overthrowing him by a hair (I can’t unsee it), and Chad Ochocinco’s carcass spread wide for the entire second half, covered by a single cornerback and that’s it, as the Giants willfully ignored him (I can’t unsee that, either). The bizarre set of circumstances from 2013 (the Amendola-for-Welker switcheroo, Gronk’s body breaking down twice, Hernandez going to jail) left Brady effectively weaponless again, even after he signed for less money under the assumption they’d spend the extra money on help. (Think again, Tom Brady!) Last spring, the Patriots saddled him with another bullpen-by-committee of “weapons” that, except for Gronk If He’s Healthy, you wouldn’t start in your fantasy league unless your better players were on a bye. That’s where we are right now. And so it’s difficult to compare Brady’s career and Manning’s career for two reasons that even the world’s biggest Manning fan would concede. First, Manning spent his first 12 seasons playing every home game indoors. (I was too lazy to look this up, but I’d bet anything that Manning played at least 100 more dome games than Brady during their careers, and Brady played at least 60-65 more cold-weather games than Manning did.) And second, Manning was blessed with better weapons from 2001 through 2006 (it wasn’t close), then it swung Brady’s way in 2007 (16-0) and 2008 (Brady played less than eight minutes), then it was probably a draw from 2009 through 2011, then Manning grabbed the upper hand again in 2012 and blew Brady’s weapons out of the water in 2013 and 2014. Of course, you could argue that New England’s teams (three Lombardis, five Super Bowls, eight AFC title games) performed better than Manning’s teams (one Lombardi, three Super Bowls, four AFC title games) because, in the salary-cap era, Belichick favored roster balance over roster imbalance. In Manning’s last few Colts seasons, especially, Indy’s commitment to offense ended up hurting it everywhere else. There’s a middle ground that the Patriots successfully exploited for Brady’s entire run. But they never stacked the deck, either. Even the Moss/Welker bonanza only happened because Belichick decisively won the trades, giving up a second- and seventh-rounder for Welker and a measly fourth-rounder for Moss. He operates the Patriots like someone scouring a flea market for the best possible deals. Rarely, if ever, will Belichick pay full price for a free agent or trade up for an impact rookie. And that’s just how it is. Remember when New England barely beat the pathetic Jets two Thursdays ago? Afterward, Brady gave a secretly fascinating interview to the overcrowded NFL Network postgame show. Any die-hard Pats fan has learned to dissect the subtleties of Bradyspeak; he never says anything controversial, never complains about his owner, never makes any teammate or coach look bad or says anything glaringly negative. He’s less Franchise Player and more Kid Who Just Happens To Be Tagging Along. That’s just his DNA. But when something genuinely bothers him? In the right interview, he might passive-aggressively bring up something in the vague vicinity of the real problem, allowing any media member to run with it … only he does it so subtly, most of them miss his cues. In that post-Jets interview, multiple times, he said things like We’re still building, or I’m still getting to know my receivers, or When you’re starting from scratch again and Our offensive line just needs to jell. (Sadly, it’s not on the Internet, so I’m writing this from memory.) But as a 14-year BradySpeak student, I could tell he was BEGGING them to ask one specific question … “Tom, how frustrating is it for you to start over every single year?” Because that’s what the Patriots have done to him, year after year, with no sign of it ever changing. He took less money with his last contract — presumably so they could find him more help — and yet they’re something like $9 million under the cap (with five or six new offensive starters, depending on the game). He never really says anything, and he never, ever, ever, ever complains. Shit, he wouldn’t have even answered that aforementioned question had they taken the bait. Brady would have done the whole, Well, you know, it’s always better to have a little consistency from year to year, but I’m proud of how the guys …  and babbled that answer away. But getting the question asked — that’s what he wanted. He just wanted it out there. I NEVER HAVE ENOUGH HELP. I START FROM SCRATCH EVERY FREAKING SEASON. I AM 37 YEARS OLD. MY WINDOW IS CLOSING ON ME. I’M NOT THE ONE PASSING 506 TOUCHDOWNS THIS WEEKEND FOR A VERY SPECIFIC REASON. He would never say ANY of that. For a lot of reasons — he’s a good guy, he’s a great teammate, he doesn’t want to undermine the team in any way, he wants everyone around him to think that they’re better than everyone else, and also, he’s the youngest brother of three sisters and he’s just tagging along. Meanwhile, the Broncos lost Eric Decker in free agency last spring. What happened? They went out and signed Emmanuel Sanders. He’s been fantastic. Why spend on Sanders with the Thomases (Julius and Demaryius) coming up for massive extensions? Two reasons … Reason No. 1: Denver’s window with Manning could end anytime. Like, tomorrow. Like, five minutes from now. Who knows? He’s 38. He’s coming off four neck surgeries. Coming into this season, he had played 240 regular-season games and 23 playoff games. There’s no real track record for a QB succeeding in his forties. The Broncos were thinking “Super Bowl or Bust” in 2014, and they’ll think that way in 2015, and in 2016, and for however long they can drag All-Pro seasons out of Manning. When Sanders wanted $18 million for three years ($6 million guaranteed) to spurn a sitting offer from Kansas City, they didn’t blink. Reason No. 2: Because Peyton Manning — at age fucking 38, after four neck surgeries, with Father Time eyeballing him 24/7 — wasn’t going to accept replacing Decker with someone who wasn’t a sure thing. So the Broncos signed Sanders, while the Patriots landed Brandon LaFell for exactly half the money: three years, $9 million, $3 million guaranteed. That’s a classic Belichick move — always do what’s best for your cap and your future, no matter what — and if Brady hadn’t kept rolling over publicly like he had these past 10 years, maybe he’d have Sanders7 instead of LaFell right now (yes, I am fully aware that LaFell has looked terrific lately). Maybe he would have had Deion Branch for that third-and-4 in Indy in 2006. Maybe he would have been looking at Anyone But Chad Ochocinco during Super Bowl XLVI. Maybe he wouldn’t have completed 105 passes to a seventh-round draft pick/punt returner last season. Maybe he would have won five Super Bowls instead of three. Maybe we’d be thinking differently about Brady and Manning right now. It’s weird to complain about a Belichick-Brady regime that’s been so absurdly successful. The Patriots have won 12 games or more in eight of the last 11 seasons, never dipping below 10 wins (which seems impossible, but it’s true). They’re 85-15 at home (regular season) since Gillette Stadium was built. Since 2003, they’ve won the AFC East every year Brady was the starter, and they’ve lost 20 percent as many playoff games (eight) as regular-season games (40). And Brady has started 199 games … and won 77 percent of them. They’re built to finish 12-4, year after year after year, no matter who’s on the team. I would not trade teams for anyone else in the league. It’s been an honor and a privilege to follow the New England Patriots. A blessing, even. And with that said … I can’t believe how strangely they’ve handled the final trimester of Brady’s career. Odds are, we (and I’m using “we” because I have loved this team since I was 4 years old and Randy Vataha and Mack Herron were scurrying around, so if you have a problem with that, I don’t care) will never, ever, ever, ever, ever, EVER have another quarterback like this again. He’s also 37. With 201 regular-season games, 26 playoff games and one reconstructive knee surgery under his belt. And I get it. I get that Belichick’s philosophy looks something like this … Rule No. 1: Never stack the deck for any one season. Rule No. 2: Never become too attached to a player. Rule No. 3: Always flip an asset into a better asset. Rule No. 4: Always sell high. Rule No. 5: Build your 53. Rule No. 6: Try to win 11 to 13 games year after year after year.

This Week: 0-1 Last Week: 5-10 Season: 88-34 Belichick knows the NFL playoffs are a total crapshoot. He probably did the math and figured out that eight teams can win the Super Bowl every year; he just wants to be one of the eight. It worked in 2001, 2003 and 2004. It almost worked in 2007 and 2011. It’s simple math, and it makes total sense. But he also employed one of the best five or six quarterbacks ever. In a 32-team league, the odds are stacked against stumbling into someone this good even once. It might happen once a century if you’re lucky. Like a freaking comet or something.8 The majority of NFL teams have never employed a QB even 75 percent as good as Tom Brady. Could Belichick have risked his time-proven philosophy by bending, say, 20 percent more these last few years? Would we not be discussing this if Hernandez hadn’t been arrested, or Belichick had just taken Keenan Allen instead of Aaron Dobson, or any of the other hit-or-miss stuff that fairly and unfairly defines an NFL team? Here’s what I know: When Rob Gronkowski is healthy and doing Gronk things, Brady’s offense goes to another level. These past four games (with healthy Gronk): 158 points, 13 passing TDs for Brady. Gronk played six healthy games in 2013 (197 points), 10 healthy games in 2012 (358 points) and all 16 in 2011 (513 points). Other than 2007 Moss, he’s the best weapon Brady has ever had. As long as he’s 100 percent, or close, the Patriots have a chance against anyone. And if he’s not 100 percent or close, they’re screwed. That’s the bed that Tom Brady made for himself. Peyton Manning’s bed has more weapons in it. It’s not a coincidence. Barring another unexpected flip-flop, that’s why history will remember Manning as being “greater” than Brady — one guy rolled with the punches, the other guy dictated those punches. Of course, they could keep playing and playing and playing, maybe even for the rest of this decade, if only because of the rules. I met Manning at the 2014 ESPYS, talked to him and his wife for a few minutes and eventually asked him about that. How many more years do you think you have in you? The short answer: He didn’t know. Manning believed the rules had swung unquestionably in his favor, that quarterbacks just didn’t take the same punishment anymore. He specifically mentioned not having to worry about anyone diving at his knees, what a relief that was. But he worried about his health and any unexpected bad luck, ultimately playing the you-never-know card and making a point to mention his four neck surgeries. He also mentioned the grind of just getting ready to play — the day-after-day demands of the offseason — and how that’s the most underrated factor that normal people don’t realize. When that day-to-day fire started waning, that’s when he would know. Dirk Nowitzki mentioned that same stay-or-go reason on one of my podcasts once. And Steve Nash, too. It’s the one thing great players always want us to know — at some point, the physical and mental grind of preparing to play surpasses everything else. We only see the games. We don’t see 6 a.m. every day, day after day after day, when the alarm clock goes off and they have to keep chasing something they’ve already caught. I spent maybe eight minutes with Manning, but my takeaway was that as soon as that alarm clock goes off and he’s lying in bed, with his body aching, with all of these records already in hand, wondering why it’s even worth it — that’s when Peyton Manning will quit football. Tom Brady? Now that’s a slightly different story. He has played 43 fewer games than Manning.9 He’s one year younger. By all accounts, he lives and breathes football and that’s it. Doesn’t have any other hobbies or vices. Goes to sleep early every night. Can’t really think of anything else he even wants to do other than spend time with his family. One night earlier this year, I ran into friends in New York who happened to be with Julian Edelman. After a breakout season, Edelman had been debating whether to re-sign or leave for a bigger offer … which meant he’d be leaving Tom Brady. And his friends were busting his balls about it. Go ahead, leave Brady — see what happens. It was actually pretty funny.10 Edelman knew what I did for a living. He had a couple of drinks in him. He was feeling emotional about Brady — again, it was unclear whether they were done as teammates — and launched into an endearingly genuine monologue about Brady’s brilliance. What an unbelievable teammate Brady was. What an unbelievable quarterback he was. How he worked harder, day in and day out, than any teammate Edelman had ever had. How he owed everything to the guy. We joked that Edelman almost sounded like a religious fanatic discussing the Cult of Brady or something. But that’s how he felt. I asked him how long Brady could keep playing, and without hesitation, Edelman said, “As long as he wants.” “Like, 43?” Edelman nodded. He described Brady as a “football machine,” adding, “He’s in bed by eight thirty every night!” He had never seen anything like Tom Brady. He couldn’t imagine Brady NOT playing football. Six more years, at least. That’s what he believed. (And yes, Edelman re-signed with the Patriots just a few weeks later. Let’s just say I wasn’t surprised.) If Brady played into his early forties, that would mean he was cheating — and by “cheating,” I mean “cheating Father Time.” Could a quarterback really play at an All-Pro level at 40 and beyond? Seems insane. Absolutely insane. But with the current rules, why not? Why couldn’t Manning AND Brady knock down that 40-and-over door? You can’t rule it out. And because of that, you can’t yet say that Manning officially prevailed in the Brady-versus-Manning rivalry. We know we’re in the later rounds … we just don’t know if it’s the 12th, 13th, 14th or 15th. Yeah, Manning leads on every scorecard. For now. Just make sure you don’t count out the little brother with three sisters yet. (And by the way — I’m picking the Pats on Sunday. 38-37. May the rivalry never end.)",2014-10-31T17:48:55+00:00,NFL,Simmons
194,2014 NFL Gambling Guide,"Football, football, football, football! FOOTBALL!!!!!!!! If you missed my Thursday column about Roger Goodell’s NFL That Never Sleeps (featuring my winning Seahawks minus-6 pick!), here’s the link. If you want to send along a mailbag question for my Friday NFL Picks column this season (and I’m going to need good ones as always), here’s the link. If you want to listen to my Guess the Lines podcasts with Cousin Sal every Monday, here’s the link. If you want to make fun of my five weekly LVH Supercontest Picks on my Facebook page, here’s the link. If you want to pick games against me, Ian Ziering, David Hasselhoff, Gary Busey, Mark McGrath and other well-known celebs in the 2014 Celebrity Picks Challenge Presented by Fireball Whisky, here’s the link. Here’s the good news: My Friday picks column is now old enough to vote for president, fight for our country and maybe even be someone’s freshman roommate in college. That’s right … it’s Year 18. And you think so little of me at this point that you clicked on the link in the previous paragraph. Now you have that detestable “Rude” song running through your head for the rest of the day. And you deserve it. I thought we had something. I hope you feel bad. Anyway, way back in September of 1997, I was living in Boston and writing for my self-created “Boston’s Sports Guy” website for millions and millions of readers. Fine, it was hundreds and hundreds. But that was the year I unleashed my first batch of mostly mediocre picks on an unsuspecting America. It’s been trial and error ever since. Mostly error. I juggled a handful of handicapping laws before eventually settling for the Gambling Manifesto That’s In My Head. Why abandon a tried-and-true manifesto? I learned the hard way that football changes too much from year to year to survive too many enduring rules. For instance, the gambling gods conspired in 2013 to ruin everyone who fancied himself a handicapping expert. Every sharp and every degenerate will remember the devastating Great Gambling Train Wreck of 2013 years and years from now, the same way we’ll remember earthquakes, political scandals and unauthorized Saved by the Bell movies. My B.S. Report buddy and future Gamblers Anonymous roommate, Cousin Sal, recently sent me an invaluable link from The Sporting News. The three most relevant quotes from that piece, along with my notes in parentheses. “In 2013, NFL favorites covered the spread at a 52.2 percent clip, the highest rate since 2005 and the third highest in the last 25 years … since 1990, NFL favorites covered an average of just 48.7 percent of games.” (That’s bad. That’s very, very, very bad. Every “smart” gambler is trained to grab the points and go against the public as much as we possibly can. That’s how we butter our bread. Swing our luck by 3.5 percentage points and we’re in major trouble ranging from “Crap, I have to reload my off-shore betting account for the third time this month?” to “If I don’t meet some guy named Big Al in the parking lot behind Target on Main Street by 7:30 on Wednesday night, I’m gonna be walking with a limp.”) “(For) seasons in which NFL favorites covered more than 51.5 percent (since 1990) … the average for those five seasons was 53.3 percent. In years following those seasons (highlighted in green), favorites covered, on average, just 47 percent of games. That’s a 6.3 percent swing (from 53.3 percent to 47 percent).” (Wait, this is good! Is that why The Sporting News made the real headline for this column “The Year of the Dog”? I think it is!) “In 2006, the year after the best NFL season for favorites in the last 25 years (57.8 percent of favorites covered in 2005), dogs ruled, with favorites covering just 44.6 percent. After the second best season for favorites (52.9 percent in 1998), dogs again cleaned up, as favorites went just 46.5 percent ATS. The third best year for NFL favorites was last season.” (Translation: Year of the Dog, Part Three!!!!!!!) So let’s make that one of our 2014 rules: “When in doubt, always, always, ALWAYS take the points.” Some other rules that I plan on abiding by in 2014 … Rule: Diligently avoid taking shaky QBs on the road, bad coaches against good coaches, and, especially, bad coaches coaching shaky QBs against good coaches on the road. This year’s group of shaky QBs in no particular order: EJ Manuel–Kyle Orton; Geno Smith; Johnny Football; Jake Locker Unless He Shows Us Something Early; Chad Henne; Ryan Fitzpatrick; Derek Carr–Matt Schaub; Matt Schaub A Second Time; Robert Griffin III (sorry, D.C. fans, but it’s true and you know it); Tony Romo During Any Week In Which He’s Just Had An Epidural; Matt Cassel; Shaun Hill; Carson Palmer; Just About Any Shaky Backup. Not on that list for now: Brian Hoyer (I’m a semi-fan); Josh McCown (I’m a believer); Kirk Cousins (I’m a fan); Teddy Bridgewater (I’m a HUGE fan); Blake Bortles or Derek Carr Unless They’re Playing Somewhere Scary Like Seattle (I don’t mind either of them); and Jimmy Garoppolo (my son’s first future football hero). Rule: Don’t go against Seattle, Denver, New Orleans, Green Bay or New England at home with a spread under 8½.  Well, unless you have an amazing reason on the level of “Sports Illustrated just put Aaron Rodgers on the cover holding 10 black cats while standing under a ladder and posing with his new girlfriend Caroline Wozniacki.” Rule: Don’t go against the Pats after a loss and/or when they’re getting points. We have a 13-year Belichick-Brady track record at this point. In the situation I just described, they are 97,567-2 against the spread (all numbers approximate). Rule: As always, be superduperduperduper careful of the Obvious Pick.  Whether it’s some allegedly hot team coming off a big win, the team that just looked awesome on Sunday or Monday night, the team that every “expert” is picking on Thursday and Friday, the most obvious candidate for your Eliminator Pool (like Chicago at home against Buffalo this week), or the team that’s getting picked 85 percent of the time on ESPN’s Pigskin Pick’em. Every week — repeat: EVERY WEEK — there’s always one Obvious Pick. Just be careful. Rule: Always take a beat when you’re just blindly checking off games to ask yourself, “Wait, are we sure … ?”  Like the Jets laying five to Oakland in Jersey this week. When your brain is turned off, you lay the points, right? Who the hell would take Derek Carr and the Raiders on the road? But turn your brain on for a second … should that crappy Jets team be favored by five against ANYONE? Does home-field advantage matter when you’re getting booed because you’re down 17-0 in the second quarter and it looks like Tom Cruise could start at cornerback for you? Why are the Jets such an easy pick there? Rule: Make a plan for double-digit spreads and stick with it. Picking double-digit spreads is like having a 12 against a two in blackjack — there’s no right answer, but you’re better off doing the same thing every time. In 2014, I plan on grabbing the points unless it’s a breathtaking scenario along the lines of “The Seahawks just lost last week, they’re pissed off, and now Carson Palmer is coming to Seattle and he’s starting even though he might have a torn rotator cuff.” Rule: Beware of obvious choices and not-totally-reliable candidates for two-team and three-team teasers.  You should approach every tease with this mind-set: I would feel totally comfortable betting my life on this if it wouldn’t be so bizarre to bet your life on a two-team football tease. I already broke this rule in Week 1 when I teased Seattle -6 (already covered) with Chicago -7.5 at home against Buffalo (looks sooooooooo easy on paper and I did it anyway). When Jay Cutler limps out of the game in the second quarter, blame me. It’s my fault. Rule: When in doubt, always grab an underdog at home. During a typical gambling season, home dogs will cover somewhere around 58-60 percent of the time. But during the Great Gambling Train Wreck of 2013? Home dogs started out hot as always (17-11 over the first five weeks), then free-fell into a fiery hell (25-34-2 over the next 12 weeks). Again, we have a solid amount of evidence that 2014 might be the Year of the Dog. I don’t need to spell this out for you. Rule: Make a list of teams you irrationally like and dislike before the season starts, then stick to your guns those first five weeks. I broke that strategy down in 2004’s award-winning “Simbotics” seminar — for instance, I love San Diego as 2014’s surprise 12-win contender, Tampa Bay as 2014’s “Nobody Believes In Us” sleeper, Baltimore as 2014’s comeback team, Cincy as 2014’s Slightly Undervalued Contender, and Minnesota as 2014’s super-frisky non-playoff team. I’m also waaaaaaaaay down on Carolina and Kansas City; I think the Falcons, Cardinals and Jets are worse than people think; I’m petrified of the QB situations in Buffalo, Houston and Washington; and I’m worried that San Francisco might have a Year From Hell Season. Throughout September, I am sticking to my guns — that’s how I feel, so that’s how I am picking games with those teams. Rule: Don’t forget — it’s the Year of the Dog!!! Write it down! YEAR OF THE DOG!!!!!!!!! Got it? Before we hit the rest of the Week 1 picks, I wanted to mention my “circle” theory that I keep bringing up in podcasts but haven’t properly explained in print. We don’t have legitimate NFL juggernauts along the lines of the early-’90s Cowboys anymore; the Salary Cap Era makes it impossible. By January, every playoff team just hopes they became one of the seven or eight contenders with a chance to win the Super Bowl. Think of it this way: You always leave an NBA season saying, “The best team clearly won,” with very few exceptions (2013 and 1988 being the most recent). You always leave an NFL season saying, “One of the best teams caught a few breaks, took care of business and deserved to win.” Most of it makes sense, but not all of it: the Helmet Catch, Rahim Moore, Kyle Williams, Santonio Holmes dragging his feet … I mean, in the words of Tony D’Amato, it really is a game of inches. So you want to break into that January circle. Seven contenders usually do it, then there’s always that eighth late bloomer/sleeper/surprise team that unexpectedly crashes the party. We’ll call that team the Wonk Team, since things always get wonky as soon as the Wonk Team reveals itself. Check out how the last seven seasons played out. (Teams got two asterisks if they won the Super Bowl and one asterisk if they lost the Super Bowl.) 2013: Denver (13-3, alpha dog),* Seattle (13-3),** New England (12-4), San Francisco (12-4), Carolina (12-4), New Orleans (11-5), Cincy (11-5), San Diego (Wonk Team). 2012: Denver (13-3, alpha dog), Atlanta (13-3), New England (12-4), Houston (12-4), San Francisco (11-4-1),* Seattle (11-5), Green Bay (11-5), Baltimore (Wonk Team).** 2011: Green Bay (15-1, alpha dog), New England (13-3),* New Orleans (13-3), San Francisco (13-3), Baltimore (12-4), Pittsburgh (12-4), Houston (10-6), NY Giants (Wonk Team).** 2010: New England (14-2, alpha dog), Atlanta (13-3), Pittsburgh (12-4),* Baltimore (12-4), New Orleans (11-5), NY Jets (11-5), Chicago (11-5), Green Bay (Wonk Team).** 2009: Indy (14-2, alpha dog),* New Orleans (13-3),** San Diego (13-3), Minnesota (12-4), Dallas (11-5), Green Bay (11-5), Arizona (10-6), NY Jets (Wonk Team). 2008: Tennessee (13-3, alpha dog), Carolina (12-4), Pittsburgh (12-4),** NY Giants (12-4), Indy (12-4), Baltimore (11-5), Philly (9-6-1), Arizona (Wonk Team).* 2007: New England (16-0, alpha dog),* Green Bay (13-3), Dallas (13-3), Indy (13-3), San Diego (11-5), Jacksonville (11-5), Seattle (10-6), NY Giants (Wonk Team).** From 2007 through 2013, the alpha dog made three Super Bowls and lost all three … and the Wonk Team won four Super Bowls and lost a fifth. That makes no sense whatsoever, but it also makes SOME sense if you believe that (a) the “Nobody Believes In Us” factor matters way more than we realize, and (b) the NFL playoffs are a freaking crapshoot. Here’s what my 2014 circle looks like: I’m locking down Seattle (my 2014 guess: 14-2), New England (12-4), Denver (12-4), San Diego (11-5), New Orleans (11-5) and Cincy (11-5) as my six true contenders. The seventh contender: the NFC North champ (Green Bay or Chicago are both going 10-6 and it will come down to the 17th tiebreaker). And for the Wonk Team, let’s go with either Green Bay (if it’s a wild card) or A Team Coached By A Harbaugh Brother. That’s right, San Francisco and Baltimore — I’m looking at one of you to get your wonk on. One more note: I don’t think San Francisco AND Green Bay will make the playoffs. At gunpoint, I’d say Green Bay is in, San Fran is out … and Baltimore will be the Wonk Team. My other three playoff teams: Tampa, Indy and Philly. So there you go. Why didn’t I decide on a Wonk Team to win it all? I believe the Seahawks are talented enough and hungry enough to become our third back-to-back champs since 1994. Unlike so many other defending champs, they didn’t lose three or four key free agents; they didn’t get fleeced of their slightly overqualified assistant coaches; they didn’t have to overpay any of their Super Bowl heroes; and they actually might be more explosive than last season because of Russell Wilson (edging closer and closer to his prime) and Percy Harvin (finally healthy). They have the best home-field advantage in any sport. And best of all, everyone writes off defending champs for all the reasons mentioned earlier — we just assume the NFL is too much of a crapshoot, and that you’re never getting that lucky twice. You know what? That’s awesome for the Seahawks. In a weird way, they’re almost the “Nobody Believes In Us” champs. I have them beating my beloved Patriots in the Super Bowl, followed by four straight months of my dad complaining, “I can’t believe Pete F?-?-?-ing Carroll just beat us in the Super Bowl.” Let’s quickly rip through the Week 1 picks … SEAHAWKS (-6) Packers
Winner! They can’t make the spread for next week’s Jets-at-Packers game high enough for me. Saints (-3) over FALCONS
Love grabbing the Saints in any dome, love going against the overvalued Falcons this early. Meanwhile, I know Rembert Browne already covered Bryan Cox’s taste in movies in this week’s Hard Knocks recap, as Cox dropped gems like “I like to watch Shallow Hal and movies like that,” “Adam Sandler movies — I like any movie he put out, I’m going” and “Best Man Holiday is the best movie out in the last five years, I think.” But one Cox quote stuck out for me: I like the movies that, when you go to the newspaper, and look at the review, they got three stars. ’Cause those damn people don’t know what the hell they be talking about. I wanna go see them movies, I don’t want to go see the ones for the Academy Awards. Them some boring-ass movies. I don’t want to see them movies. Too serious. I don’t want to see them movies. I got enough stress in my life to go watch some more stressful shit. I don’t want to see that. Can you really say he’s wrong? For Bryan Cox, movies are an escape from the stressful shit of real life. He doesn’t want the realism of Mark Wahlberg fighting for his life on a Middle Eastern mountain in the most realistic war movie since Saving Private Ryan; he wants to see Morris Chestnut improbably deliver his friend’s baby in the backseat of a car in Best Man Holiday, then step out of that same car with no blood or placenta gook whatsoever on his hands, slap those unsullied hands together and stick them in his pockets. He wants to see Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore take their respective kids on a $100,000 African vacation; HE DOESN’T CARE that this trip was improbably given to them by Sandler’s boss for reasons that remain unclear. You know what? My kids don’t care, either. They love Sandler’s movies. They don’t want any stressful shit in their lives, either. I think Bryan Cox is on to something. After the NFL season is over, I want to hire him for Grantland and send him to whatever the opposite of Sundance is. Bengals (+1) over RAVENS
Good luck taking the Ravens against Cincy’s D when they’re running the ball for 1.7 yards a carry. By the way, the funniest moment of every fantasy draft this year was the 35 seconds after someone took Ray Rice — millions of times around America, someone talked themselves into it, said the name “Ray Rice,” endured the immediate post-pick ribbing from everyone else in the room, realized they just made the all-time bad fantasy football karma move, then spent the next 15 minutes with the Mike Myers “Uh-Oh, Kanye Is Going Off The Script” Face. I wouldn’t have taken Ray Rice in a 100-round draft, but that’s just me. BEARS (-7) over Bills
Laying the points while acknowledging the following red flags: Bears fans are secretly about 38 percent too confident about this Bears season even if they’d never admit it; Chicago’s defense couldn’t be a bigger candidate for giving up a garbage-time TD cover; the Bears are Week 1’s A-list candidate to murder hundreds of thousands of two-team teasers, three-team teasers and eliminator pools. (And with all of that said … you get to go against a head coach who screamed “GO AHEAD AND FIRE ME!” at team officials recently, as well as a starting QB who has looked so shaky that his team just panic-dropped $11 million over two years on Kyle Orton. Take a deep breath and lay the points.) TEXANS (-3) over Washington, D.C.
Between the never-ending name controversy, the whole “Wait, Jay Gruden is the HEAD coach?” thing and the whole everyone-knows-Cousins-is-better-than-Griffin not-quite-a-controversy-that’s-about-to-become-a-controversy, I’m forced to lay points with Ryan Fitzpatrick. It didn’t feel great until my buddy House (die-hard D.C. fan) sent me this Gruden email: Here’s the problem with the racist-skins: Jay Gruden appears to be an (expletive) nincompoop. Impossibly small sample-size obviously, but I don’t like his behavior vis-a-vis command of the team, decision-making or ability to adapt to the team’s real-time needs as they develop in games & over the course of the season, his demeanor, how he talks, the way he interacts with the media, the way he interacts with the players or the clothes he wears. Other than that, I think he’s awesome. Raiders (+6) over JETS
Browns (+7) over STEELERS
Had the Jets and Steelers penciled in until I did the “Wait, are we sure … ?” routine on them. Meanwhile, here’s Week 1’s WTF of the Week: Did you know CBS assigned Jim Nantz and Phil Simms to the Raiders-Jets game? Did they secretly get demoted? Are they being punished? Did they just want to see if Simms snapped after watching two hours of Geno Smith and Derek Carr? Did they forget the Pats were playing in Miami? Did Nantz have great U.S. Open seats for the men’s final that he didn’t want to give up? Did the guy running CBS football suffer a head injury and mistakenly think it was 1968? WTF??? Titans (+3.5) over CHIEFS
You could have talked me into the Titans as this year’s Improbable Wild Card Just Because Of Their Cream Puff Schedule if you bought me two more drinks. Hey, if you had to make a gambling spread for “Number of playoff wins for the 2014 Royals” versus “Number of wins for the 2014 Chiefs,” what would it be? I think it’s “Chiefs minus-2.” And I’m taking the Royals. (Uh-oh, Rany Jazayerli is keeled over his computer keyboard right now — somebody call the paramedics!!!!!!!!!) Pats (-4.5) over DOLPHINS
I always loved the parallels between the Spurs and Pats — pounded out a steady excellence that peaked in the first part of the last decade, kept cranking out high-quality seasons because of the Brady-Belichick and Duncan-Pop infrastructure, kept hanging around, suffered some bad beats, kept hanging around, and now they’re still contending all these years later. The 2013-14 NBA season became The Last Great Duncan-Pop Season, as you know. Hoping we’ll say the same about the 2014 NFL season for Brady and Belichick. It’s certainly the best defense they’ve had in 10 years. Stay tuned. Jaguars (+10.5) over EAGLES
12 against a 2 … HIT ME! Meanwhile, here’s the funniest/angriest email of Week 1, courtesy of Stephen in Glendale, CA: Bill, let me start off by saying I was watching the Ellen Degeneres show a couple days ago because I was stoned and couldn’t find the remote. It occurred to me that you and Ellen could be brother and sister. You’re both very successful with Anglo-Saxon features and have both overcome life obstacles, her coming out and you being exceedingly mediocre. In any case, as a Jaguar fan, I’ve put up with a lot in the past few years. Everything from having to watch Blaine Gabbert try and take on a pass rush to Blaine Gabbert generally existing. When Justin Blackmon was drafted, I thought we had an All-Pro caliber player, but instead we got an All-Pro [deleted by the editors]. Last year, we started 0-8 but ended the year 4-4, a finish that I felt was something to be built on. We even had a great draft. So, upon seeing that Mays and Barnwell had their AFC South podcast, I stupidly thought “Hey, here’s a chance to hear some optimism about the Jaguars.” I sat through a half-hour of Andrew Luck talk before Mays asked Barnwell, “So what do you think the Jaguars will be good at and Barnwell responded “Scoreboard.” I hate you Bill Simmons and your Jaguar hating cronies. I hate you all. You’ll see what happens when the Bortles generation starts, Justin Blackmon finds Jesus, and the Jaguars go 7-9 this year and 11-5 next year. I mean, the defense that just ripped the Broncos to shreds in the playoffs was constructed by the dude that is currently head coaching our team! You and your smug colleagues can go to Hell. Vikings (+3.5) over RAMS
This week, I participated in an excellent NFL wins pool (described here) in which I ended up with the third, 13th and 30th picks. Seattle and New England went 1-2, so I grabbed Denver at no. 3. I took Tampa over Baltimore at no. 13 as my higher-ceiling gamble. And at no. 30, improbably, I had the Vikings and Rams on the board (with the not-improbable Raiders). My pick? The Vikings! And here’s why … • I already thought Sam Bradford was going to undermine a talented Rams team, so even if Shaun Hill ends up being 80 percent as good as Bradford (a realistic bet since Bradford was never that good), that’s a super-size undermine. • I actually like this Vikes team. Ideally, they win this game, blow three of the next four, then Bridgewater steps in and they make a belated playoff run. Lots of weapons, new outdoor stadium under construction, Mike Zimmer, All-Day, great 2014 draft, Teddy with a chip on his shoulder … sign me up. In December, when the Vikes are 9-6 and Dallas is 2-13, we’ll be laughing about how Adrian Peterson wanted to be a Cowboy. Seriously. We’ll have a nice collective guffaw about it. BUCS (-3) over Panthers
My dream Week 1 matchup: my favorite still-undervalued team playing at home against 2014’s no. 1 regression candidate. Actually, this game is like a hot blackjack table. Just shut up. Don’t celebrate, don’t brag, don’t count your chips, don’t taunt the pit boss, don’t say anything. Niners (-4.5) over COWBOYS
Booooooooooooooooo! Boooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Three quick notes here: I have Kaepernick on both fantasy teams and can’t wait to trade him right after his 49-point performance in this game; I agree with Bill Barnwell that this Cowboys defense has a chance to be historically abysmal; and Jason Garrett’s +200 “First Coach Fired” odds is the single best NFL wager on the board right now. I look forward to the Niners throwing everyone off their possibly rancid Year From Hell scent with a blowout victory in this one. So many red flags. We’ll tackle this next week. Meanwhile, here’s the funniest idea of Week 1, courtesy of Luke Peacock in Jacksonville: I went to college in Dallas and almost all of my friends from there are Cowboys fans. After another 8-8 season, I persuaded my most passionate Cowboy fan friend to start a “league” called The Cowboy Dismount, where we get 16 disillusioned Cowboys fans to agree to stop supporting the Cowboys and be assigned two new NFL teams to root for (one NFC, one AFC). There’s a buy-in fee, and at the end of the season, whoever’s team wins the Super Bowl gets 60% of the pot, and whoever’s team gets the top pick in next year’s draft gets 40% of the pot. The person who gets randomly assigned the Cowboys has to pay an extra buy-in as a form of punishment for continuing to support the most mediocre team in sports. We did the draft last week and people are legitimately excited to not have to root for the Cowboys anymore. Here’s a link to the Facebook page. Enjoy! (Ladies and gentlemen, your 2014 Dallas Cowboys!!!!) BRONCOS (-8) over Colts
“Manning in a night game” plus “Denver giving less than eight at home” plus “Indy isn’t that good to begin with” definitely outweighs “Is there anything worse than rooting against Andrew The Giant as he’s driving for a spread-busting, garbage-time TD?” But I don’t feel great about it. Just throw Denver into a tease and thank me later. Giants (+6) over LIONS
Tampa’s Lovie Smith was this year’s best W.A.R.M. candidate for my “Wins Above Raheem Morris” stat — that’s the “metric” that covers the statistically incalculable upgrade from an incompetent coach to a competent coach. He’s a big reason why I like the 2014 Bucs. Lovie Smith’s teams always compete and play terrific defense. Had Detroit hired him, I would have picked Detroit to go 11-5. You know who’s NOT a W.A.R.M. candidate? Jim Caldwell … a.k.a. This Decade’s Art Shell. This will not end well. Chargers (+3) over CARDS
Wait a second … there’s a second Week 1 game pitting an Undervalued 2014 Team That I Love against Another Obvious Regression Candidate? And I’m GETTING points? I love the Year of the Dog so much that I’m posting a picture of my dog. Let’s do this, Rufus.  This Week: 1-0
Season: 1-0",2014-09-05T12:00:50+00:00,NFL,Simmons
195,Simmons on the Road: It’s All on LeBron,"Greetings from Indiana, the home of Larry Legend, Jimmy Chitwood, St. Elmo’s, the Indy 500 and a relentlessly confusing Pacers team. Two years ago, Indianapolis hosted the Super Bowl and exceeded everyone’s expectations (including mine), handling the crush of people with ease while somehow maintaining a homey feel. I loved that entire week … you know, right until Brady overthrew a wide-open Welker by maybe 15 inches for the clinching touchdown, then the Patriots blew another Super Bowl to the freaking Giants. Aaaaaaaargh. If only sports fans could swallow pills to erase specific plays from their brains like they were Eternal Sunshine characters. I will never stop seeing Welker line up for that play, with New York’s secondary in chaos as their D-backs scrambled to figure out their coverage. Inexplicably, they abandoned the entire left side of the field and left it that way. They should have just planted the Lombardi Trophy in the corner of the end zone with a sign that said, “WELKER — THIS IS YOURS.” Welker noticed immediately. Brady noticed, too. Since it happened right in front of us, my buddy Jamie and I both noticed and started furiously elbowing each other. Every Giants fan in our section noticed and started shrieking in disbelief. For about five seconds there, we were going to avenge the Helmet Catch game. I can’t spend time in Indianapolis without drifting back to those five seconds, and the beauty of the day itself — how we kicked things off by driving to the Hoosiers gym (just two days after taping a podcast with Larry Legend), how the sun never stopped shining, how Indianapolis never stopped radiating good vibes. Everything was perfect. I still can’t believe we lost. Twenty-seven months later, I can’t believe the Pacers have a chance to derail LeBron’s three-peat. When we were in New Orleans for All-Star Weekend, the Pacers had won 40 of 52 games and loomed as a legitimate contender. Their best five guys played better together than anyone else’s best five guys. Roy Hibbert had blossomed into this generation’s Dikembe. Paul George was filming commercials and getting “superstar” buzz. The immortal Lance Stephenson was everyone’s favorite All-Star snub. I remember running into Frank Vogel, whom I’ve known since his Boston days, and he couldn’t have seemed happier about everything. Loved his team, loved the landscape, loved their title chances, loved everything. He couldn’t stop smiling. That’s what made the next few weeks so incomprehensible. We covered Indiana’s demise in painstaking detail on Grantland, as Vogel slowly became more intense than Michael Fassbender during the last 40 minutes of Shame, but nobody could answer the fundamental question: “WHAT HAPPENED???” During their embarrassing Round 1 series against the undermanned Hawks, I created a pie chart of blame: Pat Riley’s Disease of Me (30 percent); too many minutes for the worn-down starting five (20 percent); no incumbent superstar who could say “Don’t worry, I got this” (10 percent); Lance Stephenson being the one saying, “Don’t worry, I got this” (20 percent); and maybe-they-weren’t-that-good-to-begin-with (20 percent). Hibbert’s unexpected transformation into Hasheem Thabeet didn’t crack the pie chart. Neither did their broken chemistry, which I described as “they’re interacting like divorced parents who just ran into each other at their son’s youth soccer game.” Everything looked bad. Everything. And you know what? They were ready to roll over in Atlanta, in Game 6, when they trailed by five with 3:15 remaining. You always have those playoff games when things look bleak, and everyone glances around and wonders, Who’s saving us right now? For Indiana, that guy isn’t Paul George — it’s David West. West drew a foul and made both free throws, stole the ball from Pero Antic on the next possession, then drained a 19-footer to pull them within one. They were fine after that. One round later, against a scary Washington team that’s probably still kicking itself for squandering that series, Indy blew a sizable Game 6 lead in the fourth quarter. West sank the crucial jumper to grab the lead back, then swished three other shots to ice the series. Quick tangent: These last few years saw something of a sea change in NBA philosophies, driven by the advanced-metrics boom and an increasing number of new owners with hedge fund backgrounds. With a philosophical battle brewing between the old-school Eye Test guys and the new-wave numbers guys, it’s been funny (and a little ridiculous) to watch this turn into an either/or thing. Ideally, you should blend both worlds into one larger vision — that’s one of many reasons why San Antonio keeps thriving even with Duncan heading toward his 40th birthday. The Spurs value the new-wave thinking (for instance, they mastered corner 3s before just about everyone else) while also putting significant stock in personalities and chemistry. Gregg Popovich has done everything short of admitting publicly, I like having as many foreign guys as possible, they’re wired differently, they actually know how to play basketball, they didn’t just pop out of some AAU factory like the rest of these schmucks. On the flip side, you have the 2014 Rockets, a team that made sense on paper and executed a vision that looked great on paper — one big guy, lots of shooters, lots of 3s — only they never solved their fundamental Eye Test issues. Can you really win a title when your best two players aren’t leaders? Can you really throw out chemistry and assume math will carry you for four rounds? The Rockets blew multiple close games against Portland for a variety of reasons, but mainly because they didn’t have anyone like West — the seen-it-all veteran who would have made those three or four we’re-screwed-if-someone-doesn’t-score-right-now jumpers, told Dwight to stop bitching, yelled “GET YOUR HEAD INTO THE SERIES, WE F—ING NEED YOU!” at James Harden, and grabbed Chandler Parsons’s jersey in the final second of Game 6 and said calmly, “If there’s a switch and you let Lillard get a wide-open 3, I’m beating you to death.” There aren’t a lot of these guys left — reliable veterans who aren’t the team’s best player but carry inordinate sway and thrive when their team needs them most. Over the past 20 years, these guys ranged in all shapes and sizes. Hakeem’s Rockets had Sam Cassell and Mario Elie. Shaq’s Lakers had Brian Shaw, Rick Fox and Derek Fisher. The mid-2000s Pistons had Chauncey Billups. The 2008 Celts had Eddie House and James Posey. The 2011 Mavs had Jason Kidd and Jason Terry. These last two Miami teams had Mike Miller, Udonis Haslem and Shane Battier. Other than West, what other non-superstar veterans currently fit that profile other than Paul Pierce? What in-their-prime guys could even sniff this conversation other than — maybe — Mike Conley, Kyle Lowry and Shaun Livingston? What younger guys could evolve into that role other than Reggie Jackson (an obvious candidate) and maybe Kemba Walker? I don’t know what happened to those guys, or even what we should call them. Soul Providers? Heart Transplants? Scrotal Enhancers? Whatever name you create, just know that West is the best of the bunch right now. He saved Indiana’s season for two straight rounds. And so I thought Miami would finish them off in Round 3, but I overlooked three things … 1. The Pacers are an atrocious “Everyone Believes In Us!” team and an excellent “Nobody Believes In Us!” team. You could see it in Game 1 — they clearly relish being underdogs again. Even their fans relish it. Multiple Pacers fans yelled at me during Game 1, still angry that I picked Washington over them. An entire section to the right of our TV set even chanted “Simmons Sucks!” for a few seconds before switching gears and showering former Pacer Jalen Rose with love. I thought it was fantastic even as I started to secretly worry about the hotel chef dropping pubes in my scrambled eggs the next time I ordered room service. The Pacers have fantastic fans; they SHOULD take this stuff personally. But that’s the thing — these players and their fans are better off being angry, feeling like nobody believes in them, worrying about being the overlooked small market all over again and fretting that the other team’s superstar is always getting the calls. That’s their identity. That’s their DNA. Being the favorite, meeting a certain level of expectations, dealing with adversity, wearing that bull’s-eye all the time … maybe that’s not what they were meant to do. Can you imagine how these Pacers would have handled the V. Stiviano saga if Donald Sterling owned them (and not the Clippers)? Yikes. But none of that matters now. Nobody believes in them. They’re back to who they are. 2. I never realized until the pregame introductions how much these Indiana fans hate Miami. This isn’t even good-natured “sports-hate,” a concept I tackled back in 2009 with Peyton Manning and Kobe Bryant — you can sports-hate a player or team without genuinely hating them. I sports-hate Peyton’s guts, but I don’t actually hate him, if that makes sense. Well, Pacers fans actually HATE the Heat. You could feel the hostility brewing during the pregame intros — “BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!” — and you could feel their collective animosity brewing every time a Miami player did something they didn’t like. When Mario Chalmers pushed C.J. Watson into the cameraman, they reacted like Little League parents who just watched the opposing coach shove a finger into their child’s chest. BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! And that’s a subtle but important difference between the first two rounds and Round 3 — you can’t work up that kind of enmity toward a 38-win Hawks team and the young upstart Wizards. You just can’t. Is that why Indiana went 3-4 at home in the first two rounds? Not entirely … but it certainly didn’t help. We know when the Pacers thrive: when they’re overachieving, when their fans are pushing them, when they can’t let themselves relax for even one second. All that prosperity handicapped them. It fundamentally changed who they were. It can’t be a coincidence that they played their most passionate basketball in three months on Sunday. Of course … 3. Coming off three straight years in the Finals, Miami is more vulnerable than ever. That’s the real reason Indiana has a chance here — Miami whiffed on free agency with last offseason’s Oden-Beasley signings, leaving the Heat with an older, creakier version of last year’s championship team, which came within one rebound of losing in Game 6. You can’t look at a single Heat player and say, “That guy is better now than he was a year ago,” with the possible exception of Chris Andersen. Battier and Haslem look washed-up. Bosh morphed into a 3-point specialist who never posts up anymore. Ray Allen will give you two good games per series and that’s it. The Mario Chalmers–Norris Cole point guard combo is more unreliable than ever. Dwyane Wade isn’t a top-20 player anymore; if there was a startling revelation from Game 1, it’s that Lance Stephenson spent four quarters thinking to himself, I’m better than this guy … and he might not have been wrong. So it’s LeBron and LeBron and LeBron and also LeBron, and more than ever, LeBron. There’s a decent chance that the Pacers regained their mojo — much like a TV show that gets derailed by a stupid subplot for a few months, then the writers fix things and you’re suddenly saying, “Wow, that was easy, this show is really good again! We’re back!” Or maybe they’re just comfortable playing against Miami thanks to all the reps over these past two seasons — eight regular-season games, eight playoff games — and a matchup that’s strangely favorable for them. But yesterday’s game was eye-opening. We were reminded that Hibbert loves playing this team, that Miami doesn’t have anyone to defend West, that Paul George was created by scientists to defend LeBron (not stop him totally, but at least make him work), that Lance loves going at Wade, that George Hill can’t get exposed against that Chalmers-Cole combo. We were reminded that Bosh, for whatever reason, absolutely sucks against Indiana — we now have a 16-game sample size of Bosh averaging 11 and 4 against Hibbert and West (not a misprint). And we were reminded that, for Miami to advance, it’s going to take yet another superhuman effort from LeBron James. Maybe even a super-duperhuman effort. The Heat spent four years riding on LeBron, Wade, defense, Bosh and 3s, in that order … and right now, they can only count on LeBron from game to game. That’s pretty sobering. Can the Pacers keep the momentum going? Who the hell knows? It’s the Pacers! It’s like trying to guess the results of a roulette wheel. They could score 54 points in Game 2 and I wouldn’t be shocked. But if they can keep coming relatively close to that unexpected Game 1 performance, and if they can keep getting passionately insane crowds from the league’s best arena, this could turn frightening pretty quickly for Miami. Is LeBron having 2010 Cavs flashbacks? Does he have enough reserve strength to fight through a seven-game war and prevail on the road? Is his own version of Jordan’s Game 6 in Utah looming, when he has to effectively defeat an opponent by himself or lose out on a three-peat? I don’t have the answers. But when you’re in the home of the Basketball Jesus and Jimmy Chitwood and Bobby Knight and Bobby Plump and Norman Dale and Steve Alford and everyone else, with those fans going bonkers, and Larry Legend sitting there IN THE BUILDING? That’s when you don’t want to be an aging opponent looking for answers. Your move, LeBron.",2014-05-19T21:07:42+00:00,NBA,Simmons
196,The NBA Draft Lottery Karma Rankings,"Here are your odds for tonight’s NBA draft lottery …   Technicality No. 1: Denver gets the higher pick in the Denver-Orlando–New York scenario; Orlando gets the lower pick; and New York gets nothing because God hates the Knicks. Technicality No. 2: If anyone leapfrogs Detroit and the Pistons drop to no. 9 or lower, Charlotte gets that pick (so somebody needs to flag down MJ on the ninth hole and tell him he might win a lottery pick tonight). Technicality No. 3: New Orleans only keeps its pick if it lands in the top three. Otherwise, Philly gets it thanks to the Jrue Holiday hijacking. Er, trade. Got it? Are we good? One more important note: Joel Embiid is going to be the first pick of the 2014 draft. Don’t let anyone tell you differently. These teams are full of it. We’re worried about his back, we’re hearing it’s bad …  Hold on, I’m actually going to stand under the bull as he craps on me. It’s Smokescreen Central right now. And enough with the Oden parallels; unless Embiid’s pre-draft MRI reveals a career-threatening back issue (doubtful), NOBODY is passing on a franchise center who could easily be described as “The 7-Foot Serge Ibaka.” Stop it. He’s going first. We’re officially calling tonight’s lottery “Bleed for Embiid.” With that stuff out of the way, let’s focus on the percentages that really matter — the 2014 Lottery Karma Rankings! It’s not about what the Ping-Pong balls say, it’s about what the Karma Gods say. Do your boys REALLY deserve to win the lottery? Did they handle their business the right way last season? Did they embarrass themselves with a tanking fiasco? Did they make a shady trade that inadvertently affected the playoff race? Did they do anything that made you say, “They just took a poop on their fans”? Have they been so inept for so many years that their ineptitude just shouldn’t be rewarded anymore? Did they make any aggressively stupid decisions like paying Josh Smith and Brandon Jennings $78 million combined without hiring them a strong coach, or gift-wrapping a $48.5 million extension to an injured and possibly washed-up Kobe Bryant without making sure he could still play basketball three times a week? Are they owned by someone you’d describe as “an incompetent legacy kid who’d be working in a grocery store if his dad weren’t rich” or even “possibly concussed, he should seriously get his head checked out”? And on the flip side, are they doing everything the right way? Do they have a real plan? Did they make an honest attempt to make the playoffs? Could you describe them as “exceedingly well run” and/or “just a solid, solid organization”? Did they make one or more trades that could be described as “genuinely smart” or even “stunning in its vision and scope”? Are they a franchise that makes you say, “If Embiid/Wiggins/Jabari ends up there, they’ll take care of that guy”? Have they had bad lottery luck in the past? Are they due for a lottery break? Should the Karma Gods be saying, “We feel bad, we gotta hook those guys up”? Without further ado, the 2014 Bleed For Embiid Lottery Karma Rankings … 13. Cleveland Cavaliers
I can’t decide what makes them more ineligible for karma — would you go with “two no. 1 overall picks and two other top-four picks just in the past three years, but they batted 25 percent,” or would you go with “rehired the same shaky coach they already fired, gave him a five-year deal, then fired him again after Year 1”? When Obama appoints me the Czar of Sports, I’m making this rule: “No NBA team can win the lottery two times in a 10-year span.” Much less three. It’s too bad Brick Tamland isn’t a real person, because the Cavs definitely would have hired him as their coach/GM. 12. Minnesota Timberwolves
Just for screwing up Kevin Love’s contract and letting him leave after three years (instead of locking him down for five), they’re out. Also not helping: Did you know this is ‘Sota’s 10th straight lottery? Ten straight??? From 2006 through 2011, the Timberwolves had SEVEN picks ranging between no. 2 and no. 7. They’re the real-life equivalent of your college buddy who had three kids way too early in life and now uses your fantasy football draft as an excuse to get bombed because he got out of the house for four hours. 11. Sacramento Kings
Headed for their eighth straight lottery and their sixth straight top-seven pick (unless someone leapfrogs them). I’m an NBA Republican — I don’t think we should use the lottery, year after year, to keep propping up incompetent teams. It’s a broken system. We need a “Make eight straight lotteries and you’re ineligible from getting a top-three pick” rule. Also, I still haven’t forgiven Kings owner Vivek Ranadivé from trying to steal my Entertaining As Hell Tournament idea. Let’s hope he’s not the Carlos Mencia of NBA owners. 10. Philadelphia 76ers
Put it this way: I wrote an entire column about them last March called “10 Steps to Tanking Perfection.” The Karma Gods can’t reward anyone who lost 26 straight, much less anyone who turned Michael Carter-Williams into a stat-chasing, brick-laying, award-pursuing mess who learned that it’s OK to lose as long as you throw up an 18-7-7. Even if you can’t blame Philly for taking advantage of a broken system, that doesn’t mean the Lottery Karma Gods can’t scream at them in their Soup Nazi voice, “NO KARMA FOR YOU!” 9. Orlando Magic
Come on, they already won the lottery three times! And three good ones, too: Shaq, C-Webb and Dwight. I think we’re good, Orlando. Just for fun, here’s your lifetime NBA Lottery Winner Scoreboard: Cavaliers (4); Clippers (3); Magic (3); Bucks (2); Bulls (2); Hornets (2); Nets (2); Spurs (2); Wizards (2); 76ers (1); Blazers (1); Kings (1); Knicks (1); Raptors (1); Rockets (1); Warriors (1). But here’s the craziest and most fascinating NBA lottery fact ever in the history of crazy and fascinating lottery facts: Through 29 NBA lotteries dating back to 1985, only one franchise ever won the NBA title with its own no. 1 overall pick. The team? San Antonio with David Robinson (two titles) and Tim Duncan (four titles, two with Robinson). How is that possible? 8. New Orleans Pelicans
Sorry, they totally botched the Chris Paul trade (and gave him to Donald Sterling, no less!), netted about 23 cents on the dollar for him, then were summarily rewarded by  the league totally rigging winning the Anthony Davis Lottery. He’s only the NBA’s third-best asset right now and the logical answer to the question, “Who’s winning the MVP trophy after LeBron and Durant are done passing it back and forth?” I think we’re good from a karma standpoint, New Orleans. Throwing a couple karma slabs your way only because I love the Brow. 7. L.A. Lakers
You gotta respect the year-to-year greatness of this franchise. Since 1958, they missed the playoffs only five times. They won only 27 games last year; that’s somehow their lowest total since 1958. They’ve never won the lottery; since 1982, they’ve never picked higher than 10th. They won 11 of the last 42 titles and appeared in 26 of the last 55 Finals. Since Elgin Baylor joined the Lakers in 1958, they’ve trotted out at least one historically great superstar in 49 of the past 56 seasons. And they’ve produced at least 3.5 million annoying fans (easily a league record). On the other hand … they’re due to suck for a few years. Right? Why should THEY get the no-sucking-ever exemption? We’ll see if the Karma Gods think Lakers fans should suffer for a few years or not. (By the way, if the Lakers win the lottery tonight, it will be one of the funniest Internet moments of all time and — since I’ll be appearing on live TV on ESPN — I’m just about guaranteed to get fired for what I’ll say afterward. I don’t know if this means the Lakers should get more or fewer karma points.) 6. Utah Jazz
Door A: Hire a competent coach, then re-sign Al Jefferson and Paul Millsap (two really good players). Door B: Let Jefferson and Millsap go; trade for $20 million in Golden State’s expirings and pick up two G-State first-rounders in 2014 and 2017 that almost definitely won’t be in the lottery; then keep Ty Corbin as your coach just to make sure your team sucks enough for 2014 lottery purposes. My verdict: I don’t think the Lottery Karma Gods loved how this played out. 5. Milwaukee Bucks
Let’s be honest — the Karma Gods already threw them a solid with the whole “instead of losing your team to a superior offer from Seattle, we miraculously found two billionaire hedge fund guys who want to keep the Bucks in Milwaukee even if we’re not totally sure that Milwaukee loves professional basketball” thing. But unlike Philly, this franchise actually tried to compete — they spent money on midlevel free agents like O.J. Mayo, Gary Neal and Zaza Pachulia, overpaid Larry Sanders and made a sincere run at 40 wins and a first-round playoff sweep. Did that sincere run make any sense whatsoever? No!!!!!!!!!!!!! Absolutely not!!!! But at least they tried … right? (Also, Viva La Greek Freak.) (Also, this is the other “Funniest Twitter-Related Outcome” for the no. 1 pick. You know, considering they just sold the team and all … and considering we just watched the same thing happen with New Orleans two years ago.) 4. Detroit Pistons
Do you penalize them for the never-ending slew of head-scratching trades and signings, all the coaches they hired and fired, and all the money they tossed away? Or do you say, “It’s time for a fresh start for DEEEEEEE-troit basssssssketball with Andre Drummond, Stan Van Gundy and a top-three lottery pick, followed by the down-low hiring of V. Stiviano to secretly bait Josh Smith and Brandon Jennings into saying something terrible into a tape recorder so they can void both of their contracts”? (You know what? I’m going with the latter. The NBA is more fun when the Pistons are good. They cleaned house, they’re moving forward, they made a very smart hiring with SVG, and now they deserve a break, dammit. Also, Jalen Rose would start throwing $100 bills into Indiana’s crowd tonight if his Pistons won the lottery.) 3. Denver Nuggets
Turned a high-functioning, 57-win team into a dysfunctional, 36-win team mostly through organizational incompetence. So why stick them this high? Because there’s a remote chance they could win the lottery with New York’s Ping-Pong balls (thanks to the Carmelo trade from years ago). Who has worse karma than the Knicks? Isn’t this destiny? For one night, the Nuggets get to bask in the bizarro glow of James Dolan’s basketball karma. Even if they have a 0.8 percent chance of winning, once you factor in Dolan, that jumps to 25 percent easy. I have a weird feeling about this one. 2. Boston Celtics
You gotta admit, they sold as high as possible on Pierce and Garnett (three unprotected no. 1s from Brooklyn in 2014, 2016 and 2018 plus a pick swap in 2017) and Doc Rivers (an unprotected no. 1 in 2015 that has a puncher’s chance of becoming a gem if the Sterlings fight to keep the Clippers and every Clipper decides, “I am suing to play for a different team”). You can’t execute an impromptu rebuilding plan better than that. Also helping from a karma standpoint: As a lifelong Celtics fan, I’ve suffered through three tanking seasons (1997, 2007 and 2014) … and of those three teams, this was the only tanker that actually made me proud. They competed just about every night for Brad Stevens, blowing close game after close game because they didn’t have a crunch-time guy. It was the perfect tanking season, actually. I never felt like I had to take one of those 40-minute showers to get the stink off me. Throw in the way they handled Doc’s return, Pierce’s return and KG’s return and it’s hard to say the Celtics didn’t accrue some legitimate karma here. Then again, I’m a humongous homer. 1. Phoenix Suns
You can’t play it better than the Suns played it these past 15 months. They nailed the Jeff Hornacek and Ryan McDonough hirings. They successfully reunited the Morris twins and transformed them into NBA assets. They fleeced the Clippers with that Eric Bledsoe–Caron Butler for Jared Dudley–J.J. Redick trade, and then they pillaged none other than the Basketball Jesus with the Gerald Green–Miles Plumlee–2014 no. 1 for Luis Scola trade. They tried like hell to make the playoffs, winning 48 games and falling short on the final week (and only because they played in the West). They left themselves with four first-rounders and a buttload of 2014 cap space. They even made me say the words, “Hey, maybe Robert Sarver is turning into a good owner after all.” What am I missing? Who played this better than the Suns? Even if they have a 1-in-200 chance of winning the 2014 lottery, at least they can sleep tonight knowing that the Lottery Karma Gods were applauding them. Well done, Phoenix. Last note: If I have a heart attack on live TV at any point during tonight’s lottery, it’s been nice knowing you. Thanks for reading.",2014-05-20T14:55:21+00:00,NBA,Simmons
197,The ‘Would You Trade Wiggins for Love?’ Shootaround,"Bill Simmons: With my beloved Celtics stuck in Rebuilding Mode, I find myself rooting for LeBron’s Cavaliers to give Cleveland its first championship in 50 years. How they handle a hypothetical Kevin Love–Andrew Wiggins trade is crucial for that quest. What should they do? Here at Grantland, we couldn’t resist passing along our advice. I’m writing an expanded take, and then we’re turning it over to some of our other writers for their quickie takes. Lemme just say, it’s an honor to be hypothetically working for Dan Gilbert, one of the luckiest men in professional sports, as well as someone who did just about everything wrong for five solid years … only to be rewarded by winning the lottery three times in four years while also improbably winning back LeBron James. I really hope some of his luck rubs off on me. Here’s my Love-Wiggins plan in three parts: First, I’d convince Gilbert that, instead of doing the wrong thing every time and improbably having it work out in our favor, we should attempt to make the right decision for once. This would be part of a bigger game plan that I’m tentatively calling “Don’t Do the Wrong Thing Every Time Anymore.” Second, I’d convince Gilbert that the Timberwolves don’t want to trade Love yet. If they did, they would have traded him before the 2014 draft, when they could have scored the biggest package of draft picks for him AND picked at least one of those players. They’d much rather just keep leaking out that they’re continuing “talks” with Golden State about a Love–David Lee–Klay Thompson deal even if the Warriors have done everything short of putting up billboards around the Bay Area that read “WE ARE NEVER TRADING KLAY THOMPSON.” My theory: Minnesota GM/president/coach/pooh-bah/czar/second-luckiest man in professional sports because how the F is he this powerful???/head honcho Flip Saunders has been in job-preservation mode ever since he snookered Glen Taylor into giving him that job. Let’s say you trade Love, one of the league’s 10 to 12 best players, and he comes back to haunt you on another team. Or let’s say you land a young “stud” in that trade who doesn’t turn out to be exactly what you thought he’d be, or you make a high lottery pick that isn’t as sure of a thing as you thought he’d be. Well, you’re done. You’re out. You’re in Bristol doing Coors Light Cold Hard Facts. But if you bring Love back for his contract year, now he’s playing for a mega-deal on a Minnesota team that underachieved last season — thanks to a ridiculously competitive conference, poor coaching from Rick Adelman (since retired) and historically bad luck in close games. Couldn’t your team blossom like the Blazers did last season? Remember when we thought LaMarcus Aldridge was fleeing Portland … right until it turned into a playoff team and made the second round? What if that’s Minnesota next season? It’s not inconceivable, right? Trust me — Flip keeps playing that Aldridge-Portland scenario in his head. More importantly, he can’t even find a poor man’s Godfather offer for Love, much less an actual Godfather offer. (Golden State wouldn’t even pony up Thompson for him!) Flip wants no part of this generation’s one-sided “Charles Barkley for Jeff Hornacek, Andrew Lang and Tim Perry” trade that was horrible at the time and looks even more egregious 22 years later. My guess: He’d rather keep Love for now, roll the dice with the Aldridge-Portland scenario, and then, if Minnesota starts off slow, he can always deal him before February’s deadline. That brings me to the third thing I’d bring to Gilbert’s attention: You know who else doesn’t need to make a move right away? The Cleveland Cavaliers! What’s the rush? Why do we have to finish our roster in July? What’s wrong with riding out the current nucleus for a few months, getting everyone in a training camp with LeBron, then seeing how everyone meshes with him?  What if Wiggins shows signs — day after day after day — of becoming the Pippen to LeBron’s MJ? What if LeBron is throwing him crazy alley-oops left and right and gushing, “I’ve always wanted to play with a freak athlete like this”? What if Wiggins and LeBron are roaming around defensively like coyotes, stripping dudes at midcourt, jumping passing lanes and basically looking like mid-1990s Pippen and MJ reincarnated? What if sending Wiggins to Playing With LeBron Camp turned out to be the greatest thing that ever happened to Andrew Wiggins? What if this single-handedly altered his professional destiny? What if LeBron turned him into his basketball clone, much like Jordan brainwashed Pippen into evolving into his perfect sidekick? Here’s the point: THE CAVALIERS HAVE TO FIND OUT. And they’ll know, or at least have a really good idea, by December or January. And guess what. That same Wiggins-for-Love deal will still be sitting there after Christmas. None of the other 28 teams are trumping it. If it has to be done, then it has to be done — the Cavs can’t waste the rest of LeBron’s prime if Wiggins isn’t close to being ready yet, not with LeBron passing 40,000 career minutes during the first quarter of his first 2014 Cavs game. There’s a shelf life here. The Cavaliers can’t take their sweet time and wait for their supporting cast to catch up with the greatest player of his generation. They can’t. At the same time, I need to see LeBron and the young’uns for a few months before I swing a mega-deal. I want to see how Kyrie Irving and Wiggins blend with LeBron — if they figure out how to run with him, space the floor for him, ease some of his playmaking burden and let HIM be the guy taking advantage of everyone else’s young legs for once. I want to see if Dion Waiters can become this generation’s Vinnie Johnson, a.k.a. Microwave 2.0. I want to see if Anderson Varejao can stay healthy for the first time since 1975, and I want to see if Tristan Thompson and Anthony Bennett jump a level because they’re suddenly playing with one of the league’s best passers. I mean … is it OK that I see this for 45 to 50 games? Is that fine with everyone? Best-case scenario: Wiggins proves to be untouchable and Bennett shows signs of becoming a late bloomer/belated keeper, followed by Flip begrudgingly settling for a February deal of Love for Bennett, Waiters, two unprotected first-round picks (including Miami’s first-rounder that’s unprotected in 2017) and one pick swap over the next five years … a deal that, by the way, is still better than any other offer they’ll get. Yes, including the right to overpay David Lee and eventually overpay Klay Thompson. Worst-case scenario: Wiggins suffers enough growing pains that you no longer feel fearful or guilty about flipping him for Love in February … which means Cleveland would be trotting out one of the seven best basketball players of all time and one of the league’s 12 best players as his sidekick. In summary, the Cavaliers can’t lose no matter what happens. I look forward to them screwing up the final decision and somehow having it work out. In Gilbert We Trust. Here’s what the other Grantlanders think …  Chuck Klosterman: If you deal Wiggins for Love, you obviously have the best team in the East. You obviously have the ability to spread the floor and outscore everyone, and the premise of Love throwing full-court outlet passes to Irving and LBJ would make all of November feel like a McDonald’s All American Game.  These are the obvious details everyone will mention when considering this hypothetical. But I would still stick with Wiggins, and my reasons are threefold: 1. I am not totally convinced Love is much more than an incredibly skilled fantasy player. He certainly might be, but how could we possibly know (based on experience)? Such a move would still be a gamble. He doesn’t protect the rim. He seems inordinately interested in numbers. And those aforementioned full-court outlet passes evaporate in June. 2. Up until the Big 12 tournament, Uncle Wiggily was pretty underwhelming at Kansas. He had a few games in which his shooting was tragic, especially off the dribble. But he has the body, and that’s what matters. His body is better than Love’s. He defends the whole floor. He’s an underrated glass chewer. And if we all concede that Wiggins has the potential to be a transcendent player, placing him alongside a bike-riding maniac like LeBron is the best-case scenario. If you throw 20-year-old W with LBJ, you will get the totality of whatever he has to offer (and then you re-sign him for life). LeBron will not let him bust. 3. The Cavs signed LeBron. He’s the best player in the world. Let him prove it. Enough of this pandering. No more roster additions. No more gaming the system to make things easier. This is the team. Play with this team. That letter James “wrote” to SI? Idiotic. It was totally idiotic. I’m not interested in constructed apologies or histrionic aphorisms. Just go do this.  Mark Titus: “Should Cleveland give up a guy who has the potential to be one of the top five players on the planet in seven years for a guy who hasn’t made the playoffs in his six-year career? Before you answer, consider that the guy for whom Cleveland is trading is reportedly going to bolt his team in free agency next season if he isn’t traded, meaning Cleveland holds pretty much all the bargaining chips here.” Um, no? That the Cavs ever considered this trade as a possibility tells you how insecure the Cleveland sports scene is. It’s like as soon as LeBron announced his decision to return, Kool & the Gang was blasted through the entire city on loop as Clevelanders danced in the streets and Frenched strangers. Then, after a few days of this, someone tapped Cleveland on the shoulder and told it LeBron signed only a two-year deal that includes a player option after the first year. Even though it’s fairly obvious that LeBron’s deal was structured in anticipation of a projected salary cap rise, the music was still cut as every Clevelander went through the same mental anguish. Oh god, oh god, oh god. OK, don’t panic. We’ve got this. He’s not going to leave again. He can’t. There’s no way he does that to us twice. Is there? Shit, there is. He’s going to do it. He’s going to leave again, isn’t he? He’s probably already got one foot out the door. Well, if that’s how it’s got to be, let’s just go all in and win a title this year so at least we have something to keep us happy when he rips our hearts out a second time. Don’t get me wrong here — the Cavs should be making moves to win now. LeBron + Anderson Varejao + Brendan Haywood + guys who haven’t hit puberty yet doesn’t strike me as an immediate championship formula. But taking a few young pieces out of the mix and throwing in Love suddenly turns the Cavs into the obvious choice for Eastern Conference champions. So I’m all for going after Love. I’m just not for giving up Wiggins. A lot of people seem to misunderstand the talk surrounding Wiggins and assume that because he’s described as a guy with a ton of potential, he must therefore be a gamble. But just because his ceiling is so high doesn’t mean his cellar is just as low. In truth, even if Wiggins never asserts himself offensively as consistently as he should, he’s still likely going to be a 15-plus PPG guy and one of the best perimeter defenders in the league. That last bit is huge. The Cavs are in a great spot as it stands by having a young guy who can help LeBron carry the offensive load (Irving) and another who can help carry the defensive load (Wiggins). Wiggins on the Cavs means LeBron won’t always have to guard the other team’s best player. It also means Cleveland could conceivably have the two best perimeter defenders in the game three years from now. That might not sound as sexy as a 26-and-12 guy joining LeBron, until you realize that a Cavs defense with Wiggins and LeBron will get infinity steals, those steals will trigger fast breaks, and those fast breaks will end with one of those guys putting his nuts above the rim. Throw anything else at Minnesota to get Kevin Love to Cleveland. Just don’t touch LeBron, Irving, or Wiggins.  netw3rk: Rationally speaking, you can’t really argue for not trading Andrew Wiggins for Kevin Love. Critiques of Love’s game often revolve around the dearth of playoff appearances and his being a stat-stuffer. My retort would be that, if the 2013-14 Timberwolves were in the Eastern Conference, they surely would have made the postseason. And even if he is a stats hog, holy shit, look at those stats! Last season, Love scored 2,010 points, pulled down 963 rebounds, and dished out 341 assists. The list of players who have scored more than 2,000 points, grabbed more than 950 rebounds, and dished more than 300 assists in one season is as follows: Kareem six times (1969-70, 1971-72, 1972-73, 1973-74, 1975-76, 1976-77), Wilt Chamberlain twice (1963-64, 1965-66), Elgin Baylor twice (1960-61, 1962-63), Oscar Robertson (1961-62), Bob McAdoo (1975-76), Billy Cunningham (1969-70), Charles Barkley (1988-89), and Tim Duncan (2001-02). I’d call that good company. Wiggins is a very talented, ultra-athletic incoming rook who has a great chance to be a defensive destroyer and a star. He doesn’t need the ball, and that’s a plus on a team with Kyrie, LeBron, and (for now?) Waiters. But, again, Love is coming off a historically good season. Still, I think it’s more instructive to turn the question around. If I were a fan of the Timberwolves, and Flip Saunders sent Love to Cleveland without getting Wiggins in return, I’d storm the Wolves’ practice facility and burn it to the ground.  Andrew Sharp: Is Daryl Morey secretly overrated? Who’s had the better career, Tom Hanks or Tom Cruise? Jay Z or Kanye? Should you let your kids play football? Would we all be better off if the Internet didn’t exist? Has Barack Obama’s presidency been successful? These are debates. Reasonable people can argue both sides. Was David Kahn secretly underrated? J. Cole or Kanye? Is that bookcase talking to you right now? Should Barack Obama be arrested for treason? These are not debates. It’s not a debate if one side of the argument is just crazy people. That’s how I feel about the “Should the Cavs trade Wiggins for Love?” question. If we talk about it long enough it may seem like a real question, but this should never get that far. As good as everyone hopes Wiggins will be one day, Love is that good right now. I understand that playing with LeBron gives Wiggins a much better chance of maxing out all of his potential, and it’s something everyone wants to see. I even understand the people who think Wiggins could help extend LeBron’s prime the way Kawhi Leonard did with Tim Duncan. But let’s not be crazy. There’s no way Minnesota’s doing a deal with Cleveland that doesn’t include Wiggins, and if that’s the case, the Cavs absolutely have to include Wiggins and get the deal done. LeBron’s 29 years old. The East is wide open. Even if you think Wiggins will be a star — I think he will — it probably won’t happen for another three or four years, at which point the East will probably be tougher, LeBron will be older, and there’s a chance the Cavs will have wasted three years of LeBron with no titles, while the entire city of Cleveland gets a little more anxious every year. Why make it complicated? Don’t give the Warriors a chance to come to their senses and offer Thompson. Love and LeBron would be diabolical right this second. The passing alone would make them the most entertaining team on earth. They wouldn’t even need three other players. Just let them run a two-man weave on the entire league. Think about it this way: What do other teams want the Cavs to do? Teams could take their chances the next few years against LeBron and Kyrie with a bunch of young guys and broken-down veterans trying to fill in the gaps around them. Or they could spend the next five years facing a new superteam with Love, LeBron, and Kyrie, three superstars smack in the middle of their primes, with less pressure on the young guys and a new cast of veterans signing on every summer. I’m sure it’s tough for Cleveland fans to watch Vines like this and imagine that player somewhere else, but come on. Don’t overthink this. The biggest reason the Cavs should trade Wiggins for Love is because every team in the league is quietly praying they’re crazy enough not to.

198,The Week of NFL Reckoning,"It’s Week 11! I love Week 11! Here’s what happens in Week 11 … We Can Officially Cross Off One-Third of the NFL’s Teams
Go away, dregs of the NFL! YOU WILL NOT MAKE THE PLAYOFFS! For the next seven weeks, these 11 teams exist only to screw up three-team teasers, generate “Will (fill in the blank) get (fired or benched)?” headlines, feed our fantasy football addiction, ruin any eliminator pools that aren’t over yet, provide unintentional comedy fodder, and (in the case of Chicago, anyway) ruin their city’s collective will to live. Your 2014 cross-offs: Oakland, Tampa Bay, Jacksonville, Tennessee, both New York teams, St. Louis, Washington, Houston, Minnesota, Chicago, and Chicago a second time. The “Loser Leaves Town” Matches
Before the WWE hijacked every U.S. pro wrestling corner, smaller promotions in Texas, Georgia, Memphis and Canada survived by developing their own stars. Many times, those stars would leave for bigger promotions like NWA or WWE, only it was wrestling, so they’d “leave” by losing what was called a “Loser Leaves Town” match. In the NFL, those matches start happening in Week 11 — one or two “Loser Leaves Town” (or in this case, the playoff picture) games that actually mean something. Like Miami (now 6-4) knocking out Buffalo (5-5) last night. Sayonara, Buffalo. See you in 2014. And get out of town, Michael Hayes!  The “My Team Doesn’t Suck Quite Enough” Conundrum
A November staple covering any fan base that gives up on the current season, starts dreaming about the next draft’s franchise-saving QB (in this case, Marcus Mariota), shifts into rooting-against-my-own-team mode, then watches in abject horror when they can’t even tank the season correctly. You know, like the Jets upsetting Pittsburgh last Sunday. Congrats on the win, Jets fans! Say good-bye to the Marcus Mariota era! Enjoy the anonymous 6-foot-8 right tackle you’re drafting! Struggling Coaches Losing Their Minds
We saw it before Week 10 when Lovie Smith inexplicably benched the vaguely promising Mike Glennon for the not-promising-whatsoever Josh McCown. And we saw it again this week when Jeff Fisher claimed that 25-year-old Austin Davis would remain St. Louis’s QB for the rest of the season, then inexplicably benched him two days later for 34-year-old Shaun Hill. And why? According to Fisher, “the best thing to do at this point moving forward is to lean on the experienced quarterback.” Experienced in what? Losing? Since 2010, Shaun Hill is 3-8 as a starter! That’s like Fox firing John Mulaney from Mulaney because it wanted to lean on a more experienced actor like Ian Ziering. Coaches LOSE THEIR SHIT in November. Random Press Conferences Get Sad-Wonky
In October, as coaches and players get more and more frustrated, press conferences start getting angry-wonky. And that’s how you end up with moments like this.  “IF YOU WANT TO CROWN ’EM, THEN CROWN THEIR ASS! BUT THEY ARE WHO WE THOUGHT THEY WERE! AND WE LET ’EM OFF THE HOOK!” Thanks, Coach. But in the Weeks 10-11 range, as teams and fans start giving up hope, press conferences become more sad-wonky. And that’s how you end up with a lifelong YouTube headline like “Bucs QB Josh McCown cries in post-game press conference.”  Beleaguered Fan Bases Graduate From “Profoundly Depressed” to “Really Bitter”
And it manifests itself in occasionally hilarious ways. Like this fake Tampa radio ad begging for volunteers for the Bucs’ overmatched offensive line. Or Chicago fans responding to that Packers-Bears annihilation by cranking out mean Internet meme after mean Internet meme. Actually, Bears fans are so bitter that, when The Onion wrote an article pretending that Jay Cutler blamed the punter for Chicago’s woes, Bears fans believed it was real and flipped out. All bets are off in the bitterness/biting-humor departments when your team sucks in November. Speaking of Cutler … The Annual “Jay Cutler Is Jeff George” Email Barrage
First the foliage changes, then comes Halloween, then the Cutler-George email barrage, then Thanksgiving. Those emails usually resemble this recent one from Andrew in Las Vegas: “Why hasn’t anyone compared Jay Cutler to Jeff George yet? Big arms, tremendous upside, misanthropic QBs who always stink it up but put up big numbers. If smoking Jay Cutler grows a mustache, this comparison is a lock. Cutler through 2014: 26,030 yards, 172-121 TD-INT, 85.5 rating. George’s career: 27,602 yards, 154-113 TD-INT, 80.4 rating. Jay Jeff George Cutler.” Please, hold this thought for when we get to the Bears section of this week’s picks. The Annual Fantasy Football Angry Email Chain
I love when this happens. See, Week 11 is when one-third of your fantasy league realizes that it can’t make the playoffs. That leads to one of the following three outcomes: (a) someone making a shady trade to help a buddy, (b) a checked-out owner forgetting to sub out a starter on a bye, (c) someone who’s been mathematically eliminated grabbing the best waiver-wire free agent anyway, just to be a total dick. What happens next? Any of these three events trigger a leaguewide email chain that starts off as a ball-busting thing and degenerates into mean-spirited barbs that keep degenerating … and degenerating … and if someone doesn’t squash the chain, potentially, someone will cross the line with something like, “That’s why I hooked up with your girlfriend in college, because YOU ARE AN ASSHOLE.” And then the email chain dies and everyone pretends it never happened. The “Nobody Believes in Us” Team Officially Reveals Itself
Really, that team revealed itself in Week 10 … but we didn’t realize its identity until Week 11. The obvious candidate here: Arizona losing all Super Bowl believability after Carson Palmer went down … or did it? (We’ll get to that later.) The stealth candidate? This one hurts … I blew it. Last Friday, I posted my Week 10 column, made a bunch of M. Night Harbaughlan jokes and received two subsequent emails that made me want to injure myself. I can’t believe I missed it. Dammit. Anyway, those emails … Drew in Seattle: “I want this on record now after your Week 10 picks. The Niners have quickly become the ‘Nobody Believes in Us’ team. Everyone is so concerned about Harbaugh leaving and not paying attention to the fact that they are clearly the most dangerous team. Have wins over the ’Boys and Eagles (so they win any wild-card tiebreaker) plus still have one Arizona game that could be for the division. Niners are going to run the table and finish 12-4. They will then meet your beloved Pats in the Super Bowl and what happens then, well, probably can’t show that on network tv. Hope you run this email, after all of this comes true.” Michael in Santa Barbara: “I just saw another headline titled ‘Are the 49ers done?’ This follows a stream of trade rumors, reported tension, mutiny, insider trading, treason, and ebola. It’s official — nobody believes in the 49ers. The remaining schedule is: @NO, @NYG, WASH, SEA, @OAK, @SEA, SD, ARI. I suspect they will be a good, healthy team by the time they host the Seahawks on Thanksgiving. They are in most successful road team over the past 3 seasons. They can win 6 of their remaining games. And NOBODY BELIEVES IN THEM! Not even Vegas. The 49ers are 25/1 odds to win the Super Bowl. Let that sink in for a second. They are going to peak at the perfect time. If they have a ticket to the dance, they are posed to make a run like the 2011 Giants. The 49ers at 25/1 is more enticing than your Royals bet at 18/1. (By the way, why didn’t you and Sal hedge?)” And now? They’re 17-to-1. And they’ll probably be 7-4 in two weeks … with that Thanksgiving home game against Seattle waiting. Hmmmmmmmm. Is it too late to believe that nobody believes in the Niners? Quickly, here’s the case for the Cardinals. Punnet in Phoenix: “Last week you wrote about the Cardinals transitioning from a ‘nobody believes in us’ team to an ‘everybody believes in us’ team. Now that Carson is out with a torn ACL and Stanton is in, we’re back to ‘nobody believes in us!’ Has any other team transitioned so quickly? It captures what it means to be an Arizona sports fan — you oscillate back and forth with legitimate hope and depression about your teams.” Ben C. in Tempe: “I can’t believe this! (No I’m not mad, I’m happy). Yes, Carson Palmer obtaining a potentially career-ending injury 2 days after obtaining a 3 year contract extension is pretty depressing, but think about the most important ramifications of yesterday’s game. Not only did the Cardinals win, but we went from being the possibly-over-hyped- too-much-confidence-team to once again…. wait for it…. NOBODY BELIEVES IN US!!! There is a white guy who loves wearing kangol hats who is very ready for the rest of this season. P.S. sorry Carson.” (So … Niners or Cardinals? I’ll give my verdict later in the column. Let’s hope nobody believes in my verdict.) We’re Officially in “One Sunday Annihilates Every Gambler” Range
Every November features one bonkers gambling Sunday that crushes absolutely everyone. Bonkers Gambling Sunday always happens in Week 11, 12 or 13; it always features at least two big-money dogs winning outright along with two other crazy endings that send Vegas into a tizzy; and it always ends with Chris Berman declaring on Sunday night, “And Teej, that was one WILD Week (fill in the number) in the National Football League.” Because I’m a masochist, I love knowing that Bonkers Gambling Sunday is coming, then insisting on betting and trying to brazenly avert the Bonkers Gambling Sunday land mines the way you’d sidestep cars if you stupidly walked across a highway. WARNING: Bonkers Gambling Sunday might happen this weekend. The favorites went 10-2 last Sunday/Monday and climbed over .500 against the spread in 2014. In other words …  The RGABJTLTTHWAUCTWDNCHHJATNMIPTCWUJLTOW
That’s the acronym for “Roger Goodell’s annual botch job that’s limping toward the holidays with an unclear conclusion that will definitely not cost him his job as the national media intermittently pretends to care while ultimately just looking the other way.” (I really need to work on getting better at acronyms.) This time around, the Goodell-Rice saga somehow made it to mid-November without a clear resolution to the question “Why did Goodell re-suspend Rice without any new evidence, and why did he pretend that he DID have new evidence?” The two-day independent hearing concluded on November 6. Hold on, I’m not good at math … wait, that was eight days ago. What’s going on? Why don’t we have a ruling yet? It has taken eight days and counting to digest a two-day hearing? No wonder this country is so screwed up. The Sneaky-Great Division Wager
By Week 11, there’s always one under-the-radar divisional wager with sneaky-great odds lurking out there. So what’s that wager in 2014? I’m glad you asked! It’s the 6-4 Ravens fetching +260 odds to win the AFC North. Just do the math. STEELERS (+320 odds): They’re 6-4 with a fairly easy schedule remaining (@TN, bye, NO, @Cin, @ATL, KC, Cin), but that’s also the problem. Mike Tomlin’s Steelers teams love blowing games to NFL doormats — as you might have noticed last weekend, or if you frequent Reddit’s NFL page and stumbled across the “Steelers are 2-10 in their last 12 games against teams with a .200 or worse winning percentage” thread. Remember, THIS was the team that blew a playoff game to Tim Tebow. Throw in the actual news headline “Ben Roethlisberger: Don’t Blame Justin Bieber for Steelers Loss” and I don’t know how the Steelers are finishing 9-7 … but they’re finishing 9-7. BENGALS (+280 odds): Andy Dalton already sucked the life out of their season; there’s a really decent chance that Sunday’s Superdome blowout loss (and you know it’s coming) will earn him the Matt Schaub Award, given annually to the once-competent starting QB from a playoff team who becomes so shellshocked that it overwhelms his team’s playoff chances. If/when they lose in New Orleans, the Bengals will be 5-4-1 with home games against Pittsburgh and Denver and road games at Houston, Tampa Bay, Cleveland and Pittsburgh left. Put it this way: Katherine Webb is probably doing a one-week juice cleanse to get ready for all the camera time she’s about to get. BROWNS (+260 odds): Jumped to a 6-3 start thanks to the NFL’s easiest schedule. As Todd in Denver put it, “My excitement over the Browns’ current first-place standing, even as a lifelong Cleveland fan who has been battered and bruised since being born shortly before Red Right 88, is tempered by this link.” You mean it might be a red flag that Cleveland’s nine 2014 opponents have won only 36.9 percent of their games? Throw in Cleveland’s history and … I mean … RAVENS (+260 odds): Maybe they’re 6-4, but the Ravens rank second overall in DVOA (12th offense, ninth defense, second special teams) and have only two “hard” games left (at New Orleans in Week 12, at Miami in Week 14).1 They’re also riding the residual karma of how wonderfully they handled Ray Rice’s situation from start to finish, especially the part where Ravens owner and frequent Roger Goodell golf buddy Steve Bisciotti held a 45-minute press conference to discredit ESPN.com’s September 19 Outside the Lines report that “found a pattern of misinformation and misdirection employed by the Ravens and the NFL” after Ray Rice’s elevator attack, then followed up by saying nothing about them ever again. Here’s how I think it plays out. Everyone but Cincy has a chance to steal the division heading into Week 17. Pittsburgh blows it by squandering a home game against AJ McCarron and the Bengals, allowing their fans to torture themselves for the entire offseason and bemoan all the dumb games they lost in 2014. The New Browns could clinch the division by beating the Old Browns in Baltimore, only it’s Cleveland, so you KNOW how that one is turning out. (I wouldn’t be surprised if Baltimore won this game on a Hail Mary. Don’t rule it out.) And Cincy loses the division by a half-game because of Andy Dalton, but also because Mike Nugent couldn’t make a 36-yarder in OT against Carolina — if he makes that, they finish 10-6 and win the tiebreaker over Baltimore (whom they beat twice), only he didn’t, so they’ll miss the playoffs because God hates Cleveland AND Cincinnati. And the Ravens? They cash in your +260 division bet before the Karma Police finally crush them in their Round 1 home game against the Chiefs. Hold on, let’s bring in Panic at the Disco covering Radiohead.  Did we cover everything? I think we did! Here’s how I think the playoff picture plays out (and I’m picking games accordingly) … Top 6 AFC seeds: Pats, Broncos, Colts, Ravens, Chiefs, Dolphins
Top 6 NFC seeds: Cardinals, Eagles, Lions, Saints, Packers, Niners Hold on, we have to give Cowboys fans a couple of moments to regroup. You guys cool? Can we finish the column? The Week 11 picks … (HOME TEAMS IN CAPS) DOLPHINS (-5.5) over Bills
Let’s just say that I wasn’t backing Kyle Orton in a “Loser Leaves Town” match — especially against a talented Miami team that has Indy fans quietly hoping they will NOT grab the no. 6 seed. (You know it’s true, Indy fans.) We need a depressed email from a Bills fan. Q: I’m a lifelong Bills fan watching this Dolphins game. I’m trying to describe to a friend the frustration with their inability to score a touchdown in the red zone. It’s like we make so much progress down the field … everything looks promising … and then … NOPE. Shut down.  In describing my frustration I came up with the term ‘Bills Balls’ — the football fan version of blue balls. It works in so many levels. The four Super Bowl losses. The Music City Miracle. The year they lost to the Steelers’ backups to miss a playoff spot. Last week against the Chiefs, and so far this game against the Dolphins. This whole season. It’s now 19-9, with the Bills kicking 3 FGs and missing another. I’m already resigned to going to bed with a serious case of Bills Balls.
—Greg, Washington, DC BS: You were so close. Great concept, solid execution … but wouldn’t it make much more sense to have an aching case of Blue Bills? Even emails from Bills fans about blue balls end up giving you reading blue balls. CHIEFS (-2) over Seahawks
Q: Has any QB cost himself as much extension money as Wilson this year? Even Kaepernick waited to become bipolar AFTER he got his extension. He was in line to make 20 million a year plus after the Super Bowl, but now with him struggling to complete 50% of his passes and throwing picks like he is Oakland Carson Palmer what is he worth? I don’t trust him to win any game home or away. Opinion has changed 100% percent since February. What do you think he is going to get now? 15 million a year? 12??
—Jason Wright, Seattle BS: The year after Tom Brady won his first Super Bowl, the Patriots lost four straight games to knock themselves out of the 2002 playoff race. His numbers for those four losses: 906 yards, 6 TDs, 7 INTs, 69.1 rating. The Pats put up 39 points total in the last three losses, followed by everyone in Boston wondering if we screwed up by trading Drew Bledsoe. Here’s the point: It’s way too early to worry about Russell Wilson. Seattle has a shaky offensive line and no game-breaking receivers. He’s in a tough spot. Seattle just isn’t that good.2 I love the Chiefs this week. (Please, Lord, don’t let Andy Reid make me regret this.) Q: Since 2011 and the arrival of Jim Harbaugh in San Francisco, did you know Alex Smith is 33-15-1 as a starter in regular season games against the spread? That’s a .687 win percentage! By comparison, over the last three years, Manning is .601, Wilson .601, Brady .536., and Luck .675. How are you guys not all over this?
—Greg Johnson BS: And he always needed a nickname! Now he has one — The Coverer. Good Lord, did I do enough to jinx the Chiefs minus-2 yet? Let’s just move on. Vikings (+3) over BEARS
It’s the Bummer Bowl. Let’s not air this game, please. Q: Do you think we should release Adrian Peterson?
—200 different Vikings fans, Minnesota BS: I’m a big believer in second chances if they’re earned, so no. I’d rather see the Vikings work with Peterson to become an advocate against child abuse, much like how Michael Vick raised so much awareness for animal abuse. Peterson could have an impact if he wanted to have one. Does he now understand that he went way, way, WAY overboard in disciplining his son? I sure hope so. Does he now understand that it’s not a good idea to whip your 4-year-old? I sure hope so. If he’s not interested in learning from his mistakes, or figuring out how those mistakes could help other people … then, and only then, would I release him. Who wants to root for someone like that? Q: On Sunday night, all of us Packers fans were having a blast, and our diehard Bears friend that was with us (in desperation) tries to change the subject by asking me, “Have you been keeping up with the Walking Dead?” And I replied, “Yeah, you mean the Bears defense?”
—Robert B., Irvine BS: Please, remember to tip your waiters and waitresses!!!!!! As promised earlier, here were two Jay Cutler moments from previous columns just to bang home the longtime Cutler-George parallels. From 2009: “I received so many ‘Jay Cutler is the next Jeff George’ e-mails these past three weeks that I’m going to have to run one just to stop the influx (from Tony in St. Louis): ‘Isn’t Cutler the Jeff George of this era? He has it all: rocket arm, surly disposition, can turn a fan base against him at the drop of a hat. Will he impress one front office after another with his physical skills only to ultimately disappoint and move on after two years? Prediction: In 2022, a wheelchair-bound Al Davis signs balding, 39-year-old Jay Cutler to a two-year, $66 million contract with the Raiders. Then cuts him five days later.’” And a mailbag question-and-answer from 2012 … Q: My brother is a big Jay Cutler fan, but I’ve had to tell him 100 times that Jay Cutler is this generation’s Jeff George. I put 8-5 odds on Jay saying/doing something to a teammate/coach in the next three games that gets him run out of Chicago. My favorite scenario is a Jay Cutler vs Mike Tice wrestling match in the Chicago locker room (think Pinella vs Dibble) where no one tries to break it up because everyone wants to see how it turns out. Followed by the new regime in Arizona trading a #1 pick to Chicago for Cutler in an effort to keep up with the division. In Arizona they will treat him like a savior until an offensive line worse than any in Chicago turns him into Jay Cutler again and his caustic nature drives nice guy Larry Fitzgerald into retirement (I can’t wait to see Larry on FOX). At the end of his career he will end up with the Raiders where he has good numbers for some forgettable 6-10 Raiders teams until he is not resigned. He will then spend 2-3 years being mentioned for every opening on every QB-poor team until people realize he is 40 years old and 300 pounds.
 —Joe Burianek, Maple Valley, WA BS: I enjoyed your Arizona/Oakland scenarios, but we disagree on Cutler’s George potential — something that’s been a recurring theme in this column over the years. (I think I’ve flip-flopped on it nine or 10 times.) Check out their career numbers; they’re totally different. Cutler: 91 starts, 20,913 yards, 134 TDs, 100 INT, 60.9% completion, 84.0 rating
George: 124 starts, 27,602 yards, 154 TDs, 113 INT, 57.9% completion, 80.4 rating (Hey, wait a second … ) (The lesson, as always: Jay Cutler is probably Jeff George.) Texans (+3.5) over BROWNS
The Browns are in first place in mid-November for the first time in 20 years!!! What could go wrong? How can the Tree of Brady matchup (Ryan Mallett vs. Brian Hoyer) NOT be decided by somebody driving Brady-style for a game-winning field goal in the final minute? I’m grabbing the extra half-point. Meanwhile, you might remember me writing about Ryan Fitzpatrick being one of the least successful starting QBs ever last week. Reader Nathaniel Lee went on Pro-Football-Reference.com’s Play Index, cracked the numbers of everyone who started at least 85 games, and yielded “four distinguished gentlemen, of whom Fitzpatrick has the HIGHEST win percentage.” Those numbers: Adds Nathaniel, “I find it cosmically satisfying that Peyton and Eli’s dad was essentially the least successful QB in NFL history.” (Hold on, I’m not done pumping my fist yet.) I mean, stop being so petty, Nathaniel. Q: After watching Carrie on Homeland for 4 seasons, I am convinced her “sleep with the suspect” is a “Sky Hook” level signature move. With both Brody and the Pakistani kid, didn’t she make it look effortless?
—Kevin, Littleton, CO BS: She’s the craziest character in the history of television. It’s like Showtime took Glenn Close’s character from Fatal Attraction, stuck her in the CIA and hid her meds. She nearly drowned her baby in the bathtub during the first episode this season and it didn’t crack the top five craziest things that Carrie From Homeland has done. And yes, I can make fun of her, because she’s a fictional TV character and I’m pretty sure there aren’t any real-life mentally ill people who continued to gain power at the CIA even after they ran off with a terrorist who tried to blow up the vice-president. Anyway, I wish SNL would do a sketch in which Carrie Matheson became an NFL sideline reporter. Carrie: I’m here with Mike Tomlin — what do you guys need to change in the second half? Tomlin: We gotta get rid of these turnovers, we’re really hurting ourselves right now. Carrie: And if you want to know the truth, you’re also hurting me. Tomlin: What do you mean? Carrie: You know what I mean. Tomlin: I don’t … we’ve never met. Carrie (makes crazy Carrie face): We’ve never met. (Laughs crazily.) We’ve never MET? We met at the Super Bowl three years ago! Tomlin: What? Carrie: In Rita Benson’s suite … we walked by each other, you said hi, I said hi back. Tomlin: I mean, I don’t remember. (Carrie moves closer and starts flirting with him.) Carrie: I totally remember. Tomlin: I have to go to the locker room. Carrie: Fine, go! (Carrie starts sobbing and whips the microphone down.) Jets’ Bye Week (+6.5) over Dallas’s Bye Week Q: Is the “30 for 30” documentary on Sunday’s Steelers/Jets game already in production? Allow me to storyboard: • A really suspicious line. To quote your Friday article: “JETS (+6) over Steelers … The line is suspiciously, curiously low for reasons that CANNOT be explained.” • Did I mention the suspicious line? Jets had just lost 8 straight games — giving up 24 or more in each game. Steelers off 3 straight wins averaging 40+ in that span. • 78 line moves. • Head scratching attempt to field a punt by Pitt results in one of 4 turnovers. • Badly missed 25yd FG by Pitt. • The game was played in New Jersey.
—Doug W., Seattle BS: I think the best part of that case was “The game was played in New Jersey.” Falcons (-1) over PANTHERS
Bucs (+7.5) over WASHINGTON
SAINTS (-7.5) over Bengals The Falcons have two wins since Week 1: both against Tampa Bay. They suck outdoors. Their coach might get fired any week. And yet … they’re suspiciously, curiously favored for reasons that cannot be explained? Hmmmmmmmmmm. Meanwhile, you know what I am definitely NOT doing? Laying 7.5 points with the 2014 Washingtons or grabbing Andy Dalton in the Superdome. Thanks anyway. Speaking of things I’m staying away from, here’s the Shakey’s Pizza Watch for Week 11: the Tom Coughlin era, NYG’s secondary, trying to be a 10-win team with Kyle Orton, Balt’s secondary without Jimmy Smith, Miami’s O-line without Branden Albert, Jay Cutler in any Packers game (1-10, 22 INTs!), Pittsburgh’s run D, the accuracy of Bad News Blake Bortles, Drew Brees as a top-five QB, Sean Payton’s entire 2014 season, Derek Carr, Chicago’s defense/offense/coaching/chemistry/mojo/past/present/future, Joe Philbin’s clock management. Broncos (-10.5) over RAMS 
Raiders (+10.5) over CHARGERS
Denver played two below-average teams this season (the Jets and Raiders) and beat them by a combined score of 72-34. So … yeah. But if we’re headed for Bonkers Gambling Sunday, then either the Rams or Chargers are winning outright. (FYI: The 2014 Chargers shouldn’t be favored by 10-plus over anyone right now.) You are NOT allowed to tease these teams together, regardless. In other news, Stephen Thompson in Ottawa believes the NFL should have designated the Raiders-Chargers game as a “Loser Moves to L.A.” match. Now THAT would be a sporting event. I wish we could bet on stuff like “L.A. is definitely getting two teams next season.” It’s happening. My money is on the Raiders and Rams. 49ers (-4.5) over GIANTS
Patrick Willis is out for the year, NaVorro Bowman is heading that way, Michael Crabtree is unhappy … NOBODY BELIEVES IN US!!!!! By the way, ESPN.com’s Mike Sando keeps track of “explosive plays,” which covers any rush of 10-plus yards and any pass of 20-plus yards. According to Sando, the Giants are allowing 9.1 explosive plays per game, the worst single-season figure dating back to 2001. In a related story, Tom Coughlin is one year older than my father. My dad and I just had the following conversation about this week’s episode of The Grantland Basketball Hour (re-airing on Sunday at 4 p.m. ET on ABC and 11 p.m. ET on ESPN2): Me: Did you like Jalen’s “Keeping It 100” segment? Dad: I didn’t understand it. 100 what? Me: It means “keeping it real.” Dad: Keeping what real? Me: Everything. You know, telling the truth about stuff. Dad: What does that have to do with the number 100? Me: It’s just an expression. Dad: Does it mean that Jalen is hot? Like, he’s 100 degrees? (Again, Tom Coughlin is one year older than my dad.) Baltimore’s Bye Week (-13) over Jacksonville’s Bye Week
As much as your dad loves CBS, how has he not gotten the Jerry Stiller/William Shatner role in a sitcom? He’s wise and philosophical, then refers to the Patriots backup QB on your podcast as “Galapagos.” I love the man.
—Nils Dahl, Houston BS: Once again: My dad is one year younger than Tom Coughlin. I’d like to pick the Niners a second time. As for the rest of the Sneaky-Good Watch: Marcell Dareus, Matt Stafford throwing on the run from weird arm angles, the Chris Borland/Anthony Barr Defensive ROY race, Cleveland’s offense when Josh Gordon comes back, Preston Parker, Mike Evans, the Percy Harvin trade for the Jets, Matt Hasselbeck being my Vocal Doppelgänger, the readers who want every awkward Mike Carey breakdown of every atrocious Jerome Boger call to be nicknamed “Picking Bogers.” Eagles (+6.5) over PACKERS 
CARDINALS (-1) over Lions
That’s right, I am backing Drew Stanton AND Mark Sanchez this week. LET’S DO THIS! In the words of 2016 President-Elect Bruce Arians: “We can win the Super Bowl with Drew Stanton. There is no doubt in my mind.” To be fair, there is some doubt in my mind. Lots, actually. But I like going against the Packers after an easy Sunday-night blowout win, and I love the Cards in the Nest giving fewer than three. Sign me up even though I apparently have magical jinxing powers. Here, look. Q: You possibly just murdered both the Steeler’s season (they lost badly to the Jets AND the Browns are in first place) and Carson Palmer’s career with your Friday column. Should we expect to see a photo of both the Manning brothers this Friday?
—Andrew, Arlington Q: Thanks for writing about the Cardinals Superbowl chances last week, it’s your fault Carson Palmer is injured now. May the Colts sign Bernard Pollard this week and ruin your season too.
—Ryan L, Tucson Q: I’ll be the 100 millionth person to point this out:  you bear full responsibility for Carson Palmer’s ACL injury.
—Brian, Indianapolis Q: I just finished reading your Y2K article from last Friday. Please spend the rest of the season writing how much the Broncos suck and how Peyton will go down any day now. Or, how Brady is underrated and will tear it up the rest of the year.
—Chris Scena, Littleton, CO Q: You really put the Simmons STINK on Big Ben and Carson Palmer this week. To quote Ron Burgundy, I’m not even mad that’s amazing.
—Justin, New York BS: Put it this way … I could have kept running those for another 200 emails. Sorry, Arizona. Just know that an Internet column actually does NOT have the ability to shred someone’s ACL. It’s been proven by scientists and everything. Patriots (+2.5) over COLTS
(I know I wrote that I believed in the Colts as a serious playoff contender just two weeks ago, but now they’re playing my favorite team on Sunday night and I have to switch gears. I know you understand.) Indy’s six victories in 2014: Jags by 27, Titans by 24, Ravens by 7, Texans by 5, Bengals by 27, Giants by 16. Congrats on those grueling wins against such tough competition, Indy! Number of points New England scored in its last five games: 201. Number of points Indy gave up to Hall of Fame QBs in 2014: 82 (Pittsburgh and Denver). Over/under on emails from Giants fans furious that I don’t think Eli Manning is a Hall of Famer: 577.5. And now, it’s time for the weekly good-luck charm Patriots email … Q: Billy Boy! Nice victory the Pats had this week! You know who enjoyed it? Tom Brady. Do you think he celebrated like Manly Madison Bumgarner and chugged five beers? I’ll bet he di …. Uh oh, wait a second. I hope he’s not crying. That weighs heavily on our new douchemetrics scale. Let’s see … Yup! He looks to be smiling but on closer examination he’s definitely crying into his long, beautiful hair. Yet another reason why Tom Brady is our 2014 Douchebag Champion!
—Eric, NYC  BS: That email gimmick hasn’t lost in 2014! Let’s do this! Steelers (-6.5) over TITANS
The Titans have scored 56 points total in their last nine halves. And in the words of Forrest Gump, that’s all I have to say about that. Meanwhile, Dennis from New York sent me this life-altering email: “Thank you for introducing me to the 1987 Crystal Light Aerobics Challenge video. I work at a medium size brokerage firm in NYC, and it has become a tradition for me and my co-workers to watch that video every Friday after the stock market closes.  It has become our unofficial way to start the weekend.  I discovered a similar video (this one with former notable pro athletes) that I believe you will enjoy in a similar vain. I especially think you might enjoy as I know of your distain for the NY Football Giants.”  Well, I watched it. And it’s glorious. Watch the first 30 seconds just for the horrible editing and the 1980s porn-movie parallels, which are both extensive, confusing and magnificent. I kept expecting to see Ginger Lynn and Peter North. No dice. From there, fast-forward to 2:24 for the important stuff. My favorite parts in order … 2:30 – Todd Christensen’s hair. 2:30 – Todd Christensen’s mustache. 2:40 – Todd Christensen trying to talk and move in rhythm. 3:01 – Check out Phil McConkey! Are we sure he never made an adult film? Are we sure this isn’t it? 3:14 – If CBS announced tomorrow, “We’ve just seen Phil Simms’s aerobics video from 1987, and we’ve decided to release him from his contract,” would you be shocked? Be honest. 3:29 – “Go Phil, you funky guy, you!” What? 3:40 – Comedy equals tragedy plus time, and comedy equals Phil Simms’s aerobics shorts multiplied by time. 3:50 – If everyone ripped their clothes off and started going at it right now, you would NOT be surprised. 4:01 – “Hey, Phil, it’s time for the cool-down, and I’m about to be abruptly and hilariously edited, I’m outta here.” 4:30 – I was alive in the 1980s and none of this seemed remotely strange. You have to believe me. 4:48 – The blonde who just hijacked the video definitely went to her hairstylist and asked for “The Sikma.” 5:02 – CBS just fired Phil Simms again. 5:09 – Please, watch Christensen in the background. I beg you. I double beg you. 5:14 – “I think you’ll find that you’ll look better, feel better and improve your athletic performance, whether it’s tennis, squash, skiing, wind surfing, or any other sport that wealthy white women do.” 5:24 – “ … Or, just chasing some pretty little girl around the room like my friend Eric here.” If it’s OK, I’m passing up all 507 jokes that would have gotten me fired there. 5:37 – CBS just fired Phil Simms for a third time. Thank you, Internet. Thank you. This Week: 1-0

199,Finding the Cleveland Misery Tipping Point,"Every time I mention in my football column that God hates Cleveland, fans from Buffalo, Minnesota, Cincinnati, Philadelphia, Jacksonville, Carolina, Houston, San Diego, Tennessee, Arizona, Atlanta and Detroit take it personally. So do Jets fans under 45, Dolphins fans under 40, Bears fans under 35 and Washington fans under 30. Hey, God doesn’t hate JUST Cleveland! What about my team? Translation: Around 50 percent of the NFL’s fan base believe God might hold a grudge against their teams. And that number would climb to 75 percent if Patriots fans, Saints fans, Bucs fans, Seattle fans, Indy fans, St. Louis fans and Denver fans hadn’t won Super Bowls in the past 15 years. It’s just one of the ways we handle steady failure. Our favorite team can’t come through, so higher forces must be in play, right? Not having a scientific way to measure which professional fan bases have been tortured the most didn’t stop me from figuring it out in 2010, then again in a follow-up mailbag. Astoundingly, three Cleveland teams cracked the top 10: the Browns (no. 4), the Indians (no. 5) and the Cavaliers (no. 10).1 That was the moment when I realized that, yes, God might actually hate Cleveland. More evidence mounted over the last four years — Brandon Weeden, Trent Richardson, Anthony Bennett, Draft Day and, of course, “The Decision” — until everything seemingly flipped in 2014, with LeBron’s homecoming and a 6-3 Browns start. Of course, it’s Cleveland, so those feel-good vibes didn’t last long. The elephant in the room: Did Cleveland remarry LeBron after his basketball apex had passed? After playing a staggering 40,000 minutes (in just 11 seasons) and carrying four straight Finals teams, LeBron might be battling the long-term effects of a historically ridiculous two-way burden. He’s still great, but he’s not GREAT. And he’s not nearly as overpowering as he used to be. Jordan learned how to compensate for declining athleticism on his last two Bulls teams, so it’s not hopeless. But for the first time, we can see a finish line for LeBron James. You couldn’t see it six months ago. As for the Browns, their football season imploded after back-to-back home losses against Indianapolis (a mega-giveaway) and Cincy (an ass-kicking). In that Bengals game, Browns hero-in-waiting Johnny Football made his first start, threw two egregious picks, couldn’t generate a single point and played about as confidently as a fan pulled out of the stands. As far as debuts go, Manziel’s first start ranks right up there with Carl Lewis singing the national anthem. If I were a Browns fan, I’d spend the winter torturing myself about Door A of the 2014 draft (staying put, then taking Sammy Watkins and Teddy Bridgewater) or Door B (trading down once, then landing Odell Beckham Jr., Teddy Bridgewater and Buffalo’s 2015 no. 1), instead of what actually happened with Door C (trading twice to end up with Justin Gilbert, Manziel and Buffalo’s 2015 no. 1).2 If Manziel becomes a hellacious bust — and it’s certainly in play — then the poor Cleveland fans would add yet another “What if?” to their torture belt. Their 2014 suffering didn’t stop there — after Roger Goodell’s Draft Day cameo doubled as the longest and most inexplicable commissioner cameo in sports movie history, Goodell’s tenure spiraled into complete and utter disgrace. Even seemingly-but-not-really impartial commissioners aren’t immune to Cleveland’s stink! So, with the Factory of Sadness churning out its annual array of holiday tears and fears, I thought we’d swing the collective karma. What if we identified the official “God Hates Cleveland” tipping point? You know, a specific moment in history that makes you say, “Oh yeah, THAT was it! That’s when everything turned!” If we knew what that moment was and when it happened, could we perform a virtual sports exorcism? Let’s find out! Put on one of those giant oxygen masks like we’re making crystal meth together, throw on a creepy protective raincoat, and wade through Cleveland’s recent sports history with me. THE BROWNS: Won the 1964 NFL championship, lost the 1965 championship game to Green Bay, then weathered Jim Brown’s unexpected retirement by going 71-38 from 1966 to 1973 — a stretch that included five playoff appearances and two conference championship games. In 1980, the 11-5 Browns snapped a seven-year playoff drought and squandered a playoff heartbreaker to Oakland (the infamous Red Right 88 game). They made the playoffs six more times in the 1980s, somehow blowing three conference title games to Elway’s Broncos: 1986 (The Drive), 1987 (The Fumble) and 1989 (Not The Drive Or The Fumble). By the time that decade ended, Browns fans were about as fun to hang out with as the dad from The Missing. By the way, The Fumble never gets enough credit for being completely devastating — it’s unquestionably a no. 1 seed in any “Most Devastating Stomach-Punch Losses Ever” bracket.3 Good Lord. I will never forget watching this.  THE BARONS: Once the California Golden Seals, they relocated from Oakland to Cleveland in 1976 and lasted two forgettable years. And by forgettable, I mean everyone forgets that Cleveland ever had an NHL team. Oh, it happened! They merged with the Minnesota North Stars in June 1978, becoming your 36-years-and-counting answer to the trivia question “What was the last NHL team to fold?” Wait, here’s a fun game: Barons (1976-78): 47-87-26
Browns (1999-2006): 40-88
Browns (2007-14): 44-82 So the Browns returned to the NFL in 1999, and since then, they have almost exactly the same winning percentage as Cleveland’s one hockey team that (a) folded after two years, and (b) left this one seemingly obscure hockey fight as its only real YouTube legacy? Amazing.  THE INDIANS: Won the 1948 World Series, got swept in the 1954 World Series and didn’t make the playoffs again until … (searching Baseball-Reference.com) … (still searching) … wait, 1995? It’s true. They cratered somewhere between 1974 (the infamous Ten-Cent Beer Night) and 1989 (when Hollywood decided that Cleveland was the perfect downtrodden MLB franchise for Major League). Although the Indians didn’t hit rock-bottom until closer Jose Mesa couldn’t protect a one-run lead in the ’97 World Series, followed by this moment two innings later. Cover your eyes.  THE CAVALIERS: Joined the NBA as an expansion team in 1970, then made the Eastern Finals five years later thanks to the Miracle of Richfield. What’s the Miracle of Richfield? Well, if you want to relive the days of balding white guys making series-winning layups, NBA fans rushing the floor and tearing down the basket, and Cleveland fans being generally euphoric, do I have the embedded YouTube clip for you.  The ’76 Cavs lost to my beloved Celtics and finished the decade relatively unscathed. In 1980, new owner Ted Stepien quickly ran them into the ground like nothing we’ve ever seen — to the point that the NBA instituted the “Stepien Rule” AND gave Cleveland’s next owner compensatory draft picks just to minimize Stepien’s damage. (I wrote about Stepien’s reign of terror last year. He made Donald Sterling look like Dr. Jerry Buss — at least from a basketball perspective.) The Cavs belatedly rallied in the late ’80s with Brad Daugherty, Mark Price and Ron Harper … and then this happened.  Red Right 88, The Drive, The Fumble, The Shot, The Stepien Rule, and Major League all in one decade? The only person who had a worse time in the 1980s than Cleveland fans was Little Bill from Boogie Nights. If you believe God hates Cleveland, then you’d have to believe that that antipathy was firmly in place for the 1980s. So, when? When did it start? Somewhere between the Miracle of Richfield and The Drive, right? Here’s my convoluted theory: The tipping point happened on December 14, 1980. Things were already quietly crumbling for Cleveland sports fans. Stepien had just traded unprotected first-round picks in 1983, 1984 and 1986 for three bench players (Mike Bratz, Jerome Whitehead and Richard Washington) and two months later, he’d flip his 1985 first-rounder for somebody named Geoff Huston.4 The sad-sack Indians were kicking off their third straight decade without a playoff appearance. And the 29 Cleveland fans who still loved hockey were being tormented by that rejuvenated Barons-Stars hybrid, which made the 1980 conference final and was a few months away from Minnesota’s first Stanley Cup final (in 1981).5 So what did Cleveland fans have going for them? The never-unsuccessful-for-long Browns, recently reinvented as the “Kardiac Kids” after tallying a whopping 10 come-from-behind wins in 1979 and 1980. In the second-to-last game of the 1980 season, the 10-4 Browns led in Minnesota by one point with 14 seconds left. The Vikings were stuck on their own 20 without any timeouts. Their win expectancy rate was basically “No F-?-?-?ing Chance.” Which is what makes the ensuing YouTube clip legitimately amazing.  First, the Vikings execute a hook-and-ladder that fetches 39 yards AND stops the clock (0:18 mark of clip). A successful hook-and-ladder? When does that ever happen? On the next play (1:10 mark), QB Tommy Kramer throws a Hail Mary moonball that somehow gets tipped right to Ahmad Rashad (yes, THAT Ahmad Rashad) for the miraculous game-winning score. I repeat: A 34-YARD HOOK-AND-LADDER IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED BY A 46-YARD HAIL MARY CAUGHT BY AHMAD RASHAD.6 Find me a crazier two-play sequence in football history that doesn’t involve the Last Boy Scout running back shooting potential tacklers.  What happened next? The Vikings won the NFC Central title thanks to those 14 seconds, winning a division tiebreaker with 9-7 Detroit that still somehow ranks as one of the 20 greatest moments in Lions history. Meanwhile, the Kardiac Kids (seemingly) regrouped by winning in Cincinnati with another go-ahead fourth-quarter drive. Don Cockroft’s 22-yard field goal clinched the first AFC Central title7 by a non-Steelers team since 1973. The Browns received a Round 1 bye, then hosted Oakland in a Divisional Round ice-fest (2 degrees Fahrenheit, minus-30 wind chill) that doubled as the NFL’s coldest game in 13 years (since 1967’s historic Ice Bowl). Look, it even cracked the top 10 in the NFL Network’s “Worst Weather Games” countdown. Congratulations, Cleveland! Hmmmm, who controls horrible weather? Oh yeah, that’s right: GOD.  Anyway, Oakland’s Mark Van Eeghen scored a go-ahead touchdown with 9:22 to play, putting the Raiders up by two.8 Cleveland punted, then Oakland punted. With less than five minutes remaining, the Raiders recovered Brian Sipe’s fumble on Cleveland’s 24.9 (Poor Sipe finished 13-for-40 with 0 TDs, three picks, a fumble and a QBR about as low as the wind chill.) The Raiders killed the clock with three runs, but couldn’t risk a field goal on fourth-and-a-foot from Cleveland’s 15 in frigid conditions. They handed off to Van Eeghen … and Cleveland’s defense stuffed him.10 HERE COME THE KARDIAC KIDS!!!!! OK, fast-forward to the 24:38 mark of that video. 2:20 remaining. Raiders 14, Browns 12. You’ll hear a giddy Don Criqui telling us to “fasten all seat belts” not once but twice. After we finish buckling in, Sipe hits Ozzie Newsome for 29 yards on second down (25:36 mark), gets a crucial pass-interference penalty three plays later (28:26), then hits Greg Pruitt on a pretty 23-yard pass to move inside Oakland’s 30 (29:50). A second-down draw play to Pruitt earns 14 more yards (31:40 mark). First down on Oakland’s 14. Timeout, Cleveland. “They called timeout. They still got two left, though,” color analyst John Brodie says. “Fifty-six seconds left to play. What do you do? You run the ball into the line, you think Cockroft can kick it from 30 yards … In my opinion, they better try to score it. Sipe will throw it in the cheap seats if everyone’s covered. But I think it’s easier to complete a pass than it would be to convert a field goal.” Quick background: The 35-year-old Cockroft converted only 33 of his 55 field goal attempts in 1979 and 1980, then would retire after this game. In a 2006 interview, Cockroft admitted that he was battling two herniated discs and had four epidurals during the 1980 season. Yes, I learned this from Red Right 88’s Wikipedia page. And yes, you know something awful happened when a sporting event has its own Wikipedia page. But four epidurals? Is that even legal? Remember the days when the NFL didn’t care about player safety, unlike now? (Hold on, I’m going to wait until you finish guffawing.) In that Raiders game, Cockroft made two field goals (both from 30 yards), missed two more (from 47 and 30 yards) and shanked an extra point. So he wasn’t exactly lights-out. And it was 2 degrees and windy and freezing. And the field was basically a skating rink. And again: FOUR EPIDURALS. Nope, you can’t blame the Browns for wanting to inch a little bit closer. Especially when they didn’t know that God hated Cleveland yet. On first down, Pruitt ran the ball into the line for one yard (33:00 mark). Timeout, Cleveland. Forty-nine seconds left. Sipe jogged to the sidelines, savoring the last 90 seconds of a promising career before everything went to hell. Browns coach Sam Rutigliano called “Red Right 88” and told Sipe to “throw it into Lake Erie” if everyone was covered. The pass play was designed for Browns receiver Dave Logan (crossing short over the middle), with Newsome serving as Sipe’s backup option in the end zone. For whatever reason, Sipe ignored Logan and threw to Newsome with two Raiders blanketing him (34:00 mark). Interception, Mike Davis. Game over. It’s one of the most unforgettable “Why did he throw that?” NFL passes of the past 35 years, right up there with Favre’s backbreaking pick against the 2010 Saints and every third Jay Cutler interception. Why not run the ball two more times and take your chances with Cockroft? What about a screen pass or a short out? Why risk throwing it over the middle into double coverage? Why? Why????? WHYYYYYYYY? As if Red Right 88 weren’t a big enough karate kick to the groin, the 1980 Raiders went on to beat San Diego and Philly (and steal Cleveland’s Super Bowl). Poor Sipe quickly morphed into the real-life Shane Falco, only without a The Replacements comeback and an iconic quote like, “Pain heals, chicks dig scars and glory lasts forever.” Sipe followed his 1980 Pro Bowl season (4,132 yards, 30 TDs, 14 picks, 91.4 rating) with 1981’s abomination (17 TDs, 25 picks, 10 fumbles, 68.2 rating) and retired two years later. By then, the city of Cleveland had already broken ground on the Factory of Sadness. You know the rest. Still, it’s too easy to declare “Red Right 88” as the official moment when God decided to hate Cleveland. If the play were called “Red Right 666,” maybe I’d feel differently. The tipping point happened three weeks earlier. Minnesota’s miracle comeback was God’s way of telling Cleveland fans, Get ready, it’s time to test you poor souls over and over and over and over and over again. Minnesota pulled off football’s two most impossible big plays in less than 15 real-time seconds combined. A hook-and-ladder AND a Hail Mary? Back to back???? December 14, 1980. That’s the answer. And sadly, I don’t have the solution. But I can tell you this: From the summer of 1986 through September 2001, the Boston sports scene suffered a 15-year swoon that rivaled any 15-year Cleveland stretch. We lived through the Buckner/Schiraldi Game, Game 4 of the ’87 NBA Finals, Lenny Bias overdosing, Reggie Lewis dying, Larry Bird’s back, Kevin McHale’s feet, Cam Neely’s knee, Nomar’s wrist, Pedro’s shoulder, Clemens ditching us for Canada and immediately winning two Cy Youngs while borrowing Ivan Drago’s training regimen, the Patriots almost moving to St. Louis, Paul Pierce’s nearly fatal stabbing, the M.L. Carr/Rick Pitino eras, the Tim Duncan lottery, the Parcells-Kraft breakup, the Desmond Howard kickoff (why?????), two of our most hated rivals (the Yankees and Lakers) forming new-age dynasties heading into the new millennium, and, of course, a never-ending World Series drought that spawned an alleged Curse and multiple depressing books. In June 2001, we poured into bars around Massachusetts to cheer on Raymond Bourque, one of the greatest Bruins ever, as he finally won the Stanley Cup … only it happened with Colorado. I remember watching at a Cambridge bar called John Harvard’s, rooting for the Avalanche like they were the Bruins, then cabbing it home and thinking, Wait a second, what the hell is happening to my life??? I felt like I had just cheered on an old girlfriend on her wedding night as she had honeymoon sex with someone else. How pathetic was that??? That’s how low we’d sunk. Local columnist Gerry Callahan derisively nicknamed Boston “Losertown,” with the Prince of Pessimism (still-toxic Boston Globe columnist Dan Shaughnessy, who turned Boston’s demons into a cottage industry for himself), WEEI’s sneering Dennis & Callahan morning show and Glenn Ordway’s condescending drive-time show as our dark overlords. But in September 2001, Mo Lewis knocked Drew Bledsoe out of a Pats-Jets game and the rest was history. Everything flipped. Just like that. It happens that fast. The truth is, God doesn’t hate Cleveland. (Yes, I just pulled off one of those sports media straw-man arguments that I usually hate.) Between the NBA, NFL, MLB and NHL (sorry, I’m not ready to count MLS yet), we have 122 professional sports teams and only four available yearly championships. Those are terrible odds!!! What the hell are we doing to ourselves???? Some cities just have better luck than others. Ever gambled at a blackjack table for hours and watched two of the six seats win big, three seats do OK and one seat just get killed? And it’s always your buddy who brought the least amount of money and had to drain his ATM three times during the night? That’s just bad luck. There’s no rhyme or reason to it. Of course, there’s one underlying dynamic that has to be mentioned — it became a recurring theme in my baseball columns from 1997 through 2004, as well as one of the main reasons why I strung those columns together for my Red Sox book. You can pass the point of no return as a fan base. You can be drained of all your collective faith, you can reach the point where you expect the worst at all times, and whenever it happens, it DOES feel like something of a self-fulfilling prophecy. This is a real thing. I once wrote about attending a crucial Red Sox–Indians game with Pedro Martinez (at his peak) and Bartolo Colon (220 pounds lighter) locked in a thrilling pitchers’ duel. Late in the game, Nomar crushed a line drive that sailed toward the Green Monster and, incredibly, struck the very very very very very top of the wall without actually clearing it. He ended up with the most depressing double I have ever witnessed in my life. You could feel the energy just vanish from Fenway. We had a guy on second base, down by a run, but we knew we were going to blow it. And we knew this because we couldn’t buy a freaking break as a city, and that’s just how it was. Every time I think about how brutal that 1986-2001 stretch was for Boston fans, I always come back to that moment. And I will always believe that players feed off that energy, for better and worse. Nomar didn’t score that inning partly because we were sitting there thinking, He’s not going to score; we’re screwed. We suffocated the players with our cynicism. It’s awful when you reach that point as a fan base, or even worse, as an entire city. It really is. Sports shouldn’t mean this much, but they do, and that’s just how it goes. But again, these things CAN flip. If you want to feel better about being a Cleveland sports fan (or a Bills fans, or a Washington fan, or whatever), read the column I wrote after the Patriots beat the Rams in 2002, or after the Red Sox improbably rallied back in Games 4 and 5 of the 2004 ALCS. When it finally flips, it’s magical. Ask any Saints fan. Ask any San Francisco Giants fan. Ask any L.A. Kings fan. Ask any Mavericks fan. Ask anyone who thought their team was perpetually screwed, and then suddenly, they realized it was all bullshit and sports is way more random than they thought. So no, I don’t think God actually hates Cleveland. But starting with that goofy Vikings game in December 1980, let’s at least agree that we have been witnesses to the most obscenely unfair 34-year run in professional sports history. It’s going to flip. At some point. (I think.) Click here for The Sports Guy’s Week 16 picks.",2014-12-19T15:43:03+00:00,NFL,Simmons
