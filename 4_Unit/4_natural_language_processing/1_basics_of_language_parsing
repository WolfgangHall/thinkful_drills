Processing and Analysis

    - NLP is two part problem
        1. process the data from original form
            - convert blocks of text into a form that computer understands
            - data cleaning
            - feature extraction
            - language parsing

            -> domain knowledge
                - word frequency
                - meaning
                - grammar

        2. conduct analysis on processed data


    - Packages
        -> NLTK
            - natural language toolkit
            - good for language parsing
            - customizable
            - older models and methods

        -> spaCy
            - processes text data
            - state of the art
            - leaner


Regular expressions
# This pattern matches all text between square brackets.
pattern = "[\[].*?[\]]"
persuasion = re.sub(pattern, "", persuasion)

# Now we'll match and remove chapter headings.
persuasion = re.sub(r'Chapter \d+', '', persuasion)

# Remove newlines and other extra whitespace by splitting and rejoining.
persuasion = ' '.join(persuasion.split())



What information can be extracted from text?

    - tokens
        - each individual meaningful piece from text
        - words
        - punctuation

        -> tokenization
            - breaking up the text into pieces

        -> stop-words
            - potentiallty uninformative tokens
            - 'the', 'of'

            - some approaches use them, some do not

Lemmas
    - can reduce each word to its root
        -> think, thought, thinking

    ** can also be done with prefixes and suffixes


Sentences
    - can consider text at the level of sentences

    - sentiment analysis
    - length of sentences
    - unique words in a sentence

    -> provide context for words

    example_words = [token for token in example_sentence if not token.is_punct]
    unique_words = set([token.text for token in example_words])



Parts of speech, dependencies, entities
    - tokens contain parts of speech
        - avoid issues with homographs
            - words that are spelled the same but have different meanings

    - dependencies
        - how words relate to each other syntatically
