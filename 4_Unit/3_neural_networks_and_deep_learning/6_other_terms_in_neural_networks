Other terms in neural networks

    -> Recursive neural networks

        - feedforward
            - clear directionality or flow to the network

        - data can run through nodes or neurons more than once

        - can be useful for drawing out more complex relationships


     -> Convolutional neural networks

        - typically the relationship between layers is (relatively) simple matrix multiplication

        - the link can involve another layer of complexity by linking those matrices via linear equations
            - called convolutions


    -> Deep Learning

        - a neural network with several hidden layers
            - no explicit cutoff to quality as 'deep'

        - additional complexity adds to runtime
        - leads to a black box solution


    -> Reinforcement Learning

        - a model gets feedback from its environment or sytem

        - model tries potential actions at random
            - checks the feedback it receives
            - learns to operate through a series of events that generates the most positive feedback

        - Ex. playing a video game (walking into a red shell = bad), driving cars
