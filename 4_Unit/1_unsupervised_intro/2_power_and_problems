Evaluation

    - probably the biggest difficulty in unsupervised learning
        - nothing to evaluate against

    -> can look at volatility of model
        -> if model is stable during fluctuations or the exclusion or addition of data, that is good

    -> often has to simply be tested
        -> if making clusters, test what you want to do with clusters
        -> evaluate later steps and tweak model

    - is hard to say whether a model is good or bad


Complexity

    - because of evaluation difficulties it is hard to decided on a stopping condition
    - models may become increasingly more complex and resource consuming
        -> particularly true of neural networks

    - impose limitations
    - keep some structures simple

    - complex models do have some advantages and can be strong
