Unsupervised Learning

    - no outcome variable
    - no concept of training and test data


Clustering

        - simplest to logically grasp
        - clustering algorithm goes over a set of variables and groups related observations

            - can tell it how many groups/clusters
                - algo creates the groups to minimize a cost function
            - can let the algorithm find the groups on its own
                - rarer application


Variable Importances

    - things like PCA
    - help find which variables are the most important


Neural Networks

    - can function as supervised or unsupervised technique

    - unsupervised
        - image recognition
        - discovers latent variables
            - impactful but not explicitly defined in data
