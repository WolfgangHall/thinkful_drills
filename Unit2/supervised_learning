supervised learning
    -> all of the models will be trained to generate a certain outcome or dependent variable
    - outcome is something observed in the past
        - want to use new inputs to generate a prediction or better understand the underlying process

    - used for sales or predicting susceptibility to a disease

    - the key -> having an outcome we have previously observed that we want to understand in the future
