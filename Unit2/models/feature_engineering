At this point:
    - the data set has been cleaned
    - data set contains outcome variable and a set of other variables that are valuable to the model
        - other variables are kept based on initial exploration and/or domain knowledge

next step is transforming potential predictor variables into 'features'

features
    -> variables that have been transformed in ways that make them best-suited to work within our model to explain variance in the outcome of interest

feature engineering allows you to get creative with your data



Fun with categorical variables
    - most models will only run on numerical data
        - to get info from a categorical variable with X levels, you need to create X - 1 numerical features
            - each is coded 1 or 0
            - if you know the values for 5 variables are 0, the sixth will have a value of 1
                - the level without a feature is called a 'reference value'
                - can make indicators that gather together categories that you think are related


Changing variable types

    - can take a continuous variable and make it categorical
        - example => comparing older adults (age > 65) to all other ages in a sample


Data Scientist  vs.  Programmer
    - programmers think in terms of strings, ints, and floats
    - data scientists see variables as categorical (nominal) or continuous
        - continuous group is subdivided into ordinal, interval, and ratio

            ordinal
                - indicate rank order (first, second, third ...)
                - does not give information in regard to distance between scores
                - often treated like categorical variables in analysis
                    - not useful in math operations

            interval
                - indicate rank-order and distance
                - example -> temperature (distance between 30 and 40 is same as 50 and 60)
                - lacks an absolute zero
                    - cannot logically make a ration
                        - 60 degrees is not twice as hot as 30 degrees
                        - degrees of heat in the air
                - can be treated as categorical or continuous
                    - most models assume a continuous variable has an absolute zero

            ratio
                - indicate rank, distance, and a meaningful absolute zero value
                - when ratio has a score of 0, none of the quantity measured by the variable is present
                - example -> age (someone 0 years old has not been born, someone 20 years old has lived twice as long as a 10 year old)

Categorize each variable in the ESS dataset:
country - categorical
idno    - continuous - ordinal
year    - continuous - ratio
tvtot   - continuous - ratio
ppltrst - continuous - ordinal
pplfair - continuous - ordinal
pplhlp  - continuous - ordinal
happy   - continuous - ordinal
sclmeet - continuous - ordinal
sclact  - continuous - ordinal
gndr    - categorical
agea    - continuous - ratio
partner - categorical
