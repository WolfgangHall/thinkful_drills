Evaluate A/B test data using t-tests

- if two groups have different means, is that meaningful or a result of random chance?

- need 3 pieces of information
    - summaries of central tendency => mean
    - amount of variability => standard deviations
    - size of each group => N

- use the standard deviations and the Ns to put the size of the difference between the group means into context
    - the higher the variability, the larger a difference between them must be for confidence in a real difference and the result of noisiness
    - larger groups give more accurate means (more accurate meaning, more likely to represent the population)
        - reduces variable noise
        - allows for detection of smaller group differences


t-test
    - a statistical test that calculates the size of the difference between two means given their variance and sample size
    - formula
        https://www.screencast.com/t/8yvsKIw5hM
    => y1 and y2 represent the means of each group
    => s1 and s2 represent the sample std dev of each group
    => N1 and N2 represent the sample sizes for each group

    => top part -> difference between mean1 and mean2
    => bottom part -> sum of each respective standard dev squared divided by the sample size
        - squaring the std devs decreases bias in estimates
    ==> divide top by bottom (difference in means / variability over sample size) -> gets the relative size of the difference in means given th amount of noise in the data
        - t-value

    -> larger t-values => the difference between the groups is less likely to be due to noise


- t-test statistic provides a one-number summary of the information in a plot

- use a/b tests in conjunction with t-tests to determine: are the groups actually different?

- using a t-test => calculate the t-statistic
    - t-statistic gives the size of the group difference divided by the noise level of the data
    - larger t-values signal a group difference large enough to be interesting
        - is the t-value meaningfully large?
        - what is the probability of getting a t-value this extreme or more, if there were no difference between the groups in the population?

        - decide how improbable you want the t-value to be before we claim a real difference between the groups
            - the probability is the p-value
                - a threshold of improbability -> significance level

- variability as a metric to evalute the meaningfulness of patterns
