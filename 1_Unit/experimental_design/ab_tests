A/B and A/A tests
    - a technique used to identify whether one version of an object of interest is better at producing a desired outcome than another
        - product, marketing campaign, email text

components of a/b test
    - two versions of something, so you can compare effect
        - control version and test version
        - the difference between the two versions is often called the treatment
    - a sample -> divided into two groups
        - groups should be similar to one another
    - a hypothesis
        - whatever you expect to happen
    - outcomes of interest
        - what you expect to change?
        - how you will measure the change
        - decide on the key metric -> captures effect of change
    - other measured variables
        - info about the two groups to ensure similarities


Good samples
    - getting random samples to test marketing emails is fairly simple because the test is easily randomizable
    - other things are harder to test because you can't seperate them as easily
        - playing music in a store -> you can't have some people hear it and others not
            - needs to be either 'all on' or 'all off'
        - think about things like seasonality, day of week, time of year


Key Metrics
    - the factor you want to measure
    - make sure it's as closely related to the business goal as possible
    - make sure you can reliable measure it
        - preferrably a passive measurement that needs no extra engagement from users
        - avoid self reported data -> lots of potential bias
