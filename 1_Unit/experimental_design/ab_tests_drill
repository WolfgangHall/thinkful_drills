Does a new supplement help people sleep better?
Set up two groups. The control group does not receieve the supplement. The test group receives the supplement. I'm not exactly sure what metric you would use to test for quality of sleep besides self-reported data.

Will new uniforms help a gym's business?
This one is a bit tricky. The expected outcome for this test is increased revenue depending on what Uniform is being worn. This sounds like an 'all on' or 'all off' situation because gym customers need to actually see the different uniforms independently. It's also a lot more difficult because of seasonal variables. Maybe it's raining when we roll out Uniform B and less patrons show up. This is the hardest one for me to pin down.

Will a new homepage improve my online exotic pet rental business?
The control group is only able to see the original homepage. The test group sees the new homepage. We can monitor page clicks and site purchases between the two groups and determine which homepage is more profitable.

If I put 'please read' in the email subject will more people read my emails?
The control group does not have any changes to email subjects. The test group will have 'please read' in the subject line. We can determine which course of action is better based on recipient interaction with the email.
