1. Predict the running times of prospective Olympic sprinters using data from the last 20 Olympics.

-> Linear Regression based model. Predicting a numeric value/continuous outcome over time.



2. You have more features (columns) than rows in your dataset.

-> Lasso Regression to reduce the number of features and keep the ones that impact the dataset the most.



3. Identify the most important characteristic predicting likelihood of being jailed before age 20.

-> Decision Trees/Random Forests have a parameter that track feature_importance and return the parameters that explain the most variance.

-> can use the value/constant associated with the feature itself
    -> if you are only working with 2 or 3 features
        -> fit a logistic model
        -> based on coefficient size



4. Implement a filter to “highlight” emails that might be important to the recipient.

-> Bernoulli Naive Bayes assumes binary data (important email or not) and is mostly used in text data classification. Commonly used in sentiment analysis.



5. You have 1000+ features.

-> Lasso Regression to reduce the number of features and keep the ones that impact the dataset the most.

-> Other means of dimensionality reduction



6. Predict whether someone who adds items to their cart on a website will purchase the items.

-> Logistic Regression in order to predict this categorical binary outcome of consumers purchasing items.



7. Your dataset dimensions are 982400 x 500.

-> computational efficiency

-> lots of features, multiple regression model

-> what models are faster on bigger datasets?

-> support vector machines for classification problems
    -> very fast on a big dataset

    -> if not, go for tree based approach



8. Identify faces in an image.

-> Support Vector Machines are commonly used in image classification.

-> computer vision problems
    -> neural networks


9. Predict which of three flavors of ice cream will be most popular with boys vs girls.

-> split the data

-> random forest method
    -> grab probabilities for each of the classes
        -> review this!
