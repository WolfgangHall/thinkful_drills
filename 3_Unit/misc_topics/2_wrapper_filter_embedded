Wrapper methods
    -> measure usefulness of features based on classifier performance
        - optimize classifier performance => the 'real' problem
        - computationally more expensive due to repeated learning steps and cross-validation

    => recursive feature elimination
    => sequential feature selection algorithms
    => genetic algorithms


Filter methods
    -> pick up the intrinsic properties of the features
        => measured via univariate stats instead of cross-validation performance

    => information gain
    => chi-square test
    => fisher score
    => correlation coefficient
    => variance threshhold


Embedded Methods
    -> similar to wrapper methods
    -> used to optimize the objective function of performance of model

    => L1 (LASSO) regularization
    => decision tree
