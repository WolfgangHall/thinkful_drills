- PCA can help explain observations for very many particular things in terms of very few general things, and, that matches how many things in the world work, which is useful.

- unsupervised stats technique used to examine the interrelations among a set of variables in order to identify the underlying structure of those variables

- also known sometimes as a 'general factor analysis'


-> factor analysis determines several orthogonal lines of best fit to the data set
    -> orthogonal -> at right angles
        -> perpendicular lines in an n-dimensional space

        -> n-dimensional space is the varible sample space
            - as many dimensions as there are variables
                -> 4 variables -> 4-D


    -> orthogonal line is perpendicular to the regression line of best fit

- Components are a linear transformation that chooses a variable system for the data set such that the greatest variance of the data set comes to lie on the first axis

- second greatest variance on the second axis and so on ...

    -> allows us to reduce the number of variables used in an analysis

    -> horizontal line might explain 76% of variation
    -> vertical line might explain 28% of the variation

- componensts are uncorrelated
    -> because in the sample space, they are orthogonal to each other

- can continue our analysis into higher dimensions

- if technique is used on dataset with large number of variables
    -> can compress the amount of explained variation to a few components

- most challenging part is interpreting the components

- usually want to standardize our data by some scale for PCA
