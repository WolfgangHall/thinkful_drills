DRILL:
Let's say we work at a credit card company and we're trying to figure out if people are going to pay their bills on time. We have everyone's purchases, split into four main categories: groceries, dining out, utilities, and entertainment. What are some ways you might use KNN to create this model? What aspects of KNN would be useful? Write up your thoughts in submit a link below.

Well, our outcome variable is whether or not the credit card holder will pay their bill. Using our four continuous variables as predictor variables, we can use KNN to determine whether or not similarly place individuals have paid their credit card bill.
