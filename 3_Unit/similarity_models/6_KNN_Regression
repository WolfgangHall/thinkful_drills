KNN Regression
    - also a reasonable algorithm for regression



Everything's the Same
    - as a classifier, the k observations voted for a category
    - as a regression, the k observations vote for a value
        - algorithm then averages the votes
            - can perform a weighted average

    - weighted averages may grossly overfit to surrounding datapoints
        - happens if decay in weight happens quickly
