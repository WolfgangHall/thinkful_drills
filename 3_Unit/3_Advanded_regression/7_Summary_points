Lasso and Ridge Regression are improvements on basic OLS regression

- Ridge Regression
    -> tool to use with correlated features

    -> imposes penalty on large coefficients
        - sum of the square of all model coefficients
            - as it gets larger, penalty gets larger

        - fights multicollinearity

- Lasso Regression
    -> efficient method of feature selection when dealing with large feature space

    - penalizes sum of the absolute values of coefficients

    - constantly checks the accuracy of model and removes params with little influence

        - coordinate descent algorithm
