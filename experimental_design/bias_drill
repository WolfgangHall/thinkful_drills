1. You're testing advertising emails for a bathing suit company and you test one version of the email in February and the other in May.

Potential customers are more likely to buy a swimsuit in May.
The potential change in customers is very likely to be a result of the time of year and not the design or content of the email. This seems like bias due to the context of the study.


2. You open a clinic to treat anxiety and find that the people who visit show a higher rate of anxiety than the general population.

Well, people with more severe anxiety are the ones looking for treatment.
Naturally, more anxious people are going to arrive at the clinic.


3. You launch a new ad billboard based campaign and see an increase in website visits in the first week.

Perhaps, the weather is crappy that week and more people find themselves online and not outdoors. The billboard would have very little to do with increased website visits.


4. You launch a loyalty program but see no change in visits in the first week.
How aware are customers of the loyalty program? Perhaps, some sort of campaign needs to be run to increase notoriety and exposure.
