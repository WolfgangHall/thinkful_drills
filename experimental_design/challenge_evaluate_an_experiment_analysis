1. Palpatine vs Vader
Potential problems in the experimental design concerns the demographics of the droids.
We are also changing two variables for each group, the slogan and the presenter.

2. Binks vs Windu
Firstly, from what I understand, Jar Jar is pretty universally panned.
These must be some weird planets.

Once again, you need to make sure the demographic groups between the planets are similar.
The surveyors should also check the difference in favorability between the friendly and the unfriendly planets.
There may be some lurking variables that are influencing the data, like the number of people each envoy interacts with.

3. Average job satisfaction
The average job satisfaction is probably not the best metric to measure in this instance.
Firstly, each group should be measured with respects to their different countries of employment.
Quality of life and satisfaction with the surrounding area play a pretty large role in whether or not someone is satisfied.
This is especially important because the HR workers are concentrated in 3 of the 5 countries, leading to a potential lurking variable in the form of geography.

4. Happy Days fitness
There is clear bias in the group tested for daily activity levels.
The people who are opting in to the data tracking program are probably more likely to work out.
Thus, the lurking variable at work here is the number of people that are actually opted in to the program.

5. Teacher Tests
Perhaps the students that took Version B studied more or have a pattern of getting high grades than the rest of th class.
The lurking variable here are the abilities of the students who took Version B of the test.
