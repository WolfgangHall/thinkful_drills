The phenomenon when an average over a number of groups shows one trend, but an average for each individual group shows the opposite trend, or no trend

    - the lurking variable problem => an unaccounted-for third variable changes the relations

    - pay attention to how groups differ from one another before averaging across them

    - be wary of:
        - averaging a small group with a large one
        - averaging multiple groups with very different demographics
