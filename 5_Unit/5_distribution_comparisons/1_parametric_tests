Check variable normality:
    - histogram, bell-curve
    - qq plot, check for straight line at 45 degree angle

Parametric vs Non-parametric
    - parametric test
        -> uses some known set of parameter estimates to represent the info in the data
        -> when data has mathematically known distribution, it can be summarized using a few parameters

    - nonparametric test
        -> used for information that does not follow a certain distribution
        - estimates used often contain less info
        - have a harder time detecting small effects
        - less vulnerable to bias from extreme observations


    Normally Distributed
        - A/B test (2 independent groups)
            => t-test for independent samples

        - A/B/C test (3 or more independent groups)
            => one-way ANOVA

        - A/B test (all participants experience both versions)
            => t-test for paired samples

    Non-Normally
        - A/B test (2 independent groups)
            => mann-whitney test
            => moon's median test
            => kruskal-wallis test

        - A/B/C test (3 or more independent groups)
            => moon's median test
            => kruskal-wallis test


        - A/B test (all participants experience both versions)
            => Wilcoxon signed-rank test

Goal of analysis is to compare the distributions between two groups and check for meaningful differences
    - compute a measure of central tendency and a measure of variance
    - compare size of difference


Parametric Tests
    - Calculate how much info in the data can be explained by belonging to groups
        - often done with group means

    - calculate how much info is on the data overall
        - often done with standard deviation

    - divide the variance explained in the means by the total variance
        - returns test statistic

    Test statistics
        - used to estimate how likely the group differences would occur if the groups did differ
        - the smaller the likelihood, the more confidence in the difference being real
            - not due to natural variability
        - typically around 5% for threshold to conclude that groups are not the same

        - identifies whether any group differs from the others


ANOVA
    - compare how much the group means for a group differs from the overall mean to how much the observations within each value of the group

    - ratio of the average group difference to average within-group variance is used
    - use of sample size, N
        - calculate the probability of getting a difference that large in th sample if there were no meaningful difference between the groups


Tests for dependent groups
    - groups may be made up of the same people
    - check if changning an element changes peoples reactions
    - leads to dependent groups

    differences from independent t-test
        -> difference score
            - subtract each pair of scores, then calculate the mean difference
                - not calculating the difference of the means

        -> error term is std dev of difference scores
