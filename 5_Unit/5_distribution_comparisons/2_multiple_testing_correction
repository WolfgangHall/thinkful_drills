parametric and non-parametric tests
    -> compute a descriptive stat for the central tendency for each group
    -> compute the size of the difference between groups
    -> compute the amount of variance
    -> put the size difference in context by calculating ratio of difference to variance

    para and non-para differ in which measures of central tendency and variance are used
