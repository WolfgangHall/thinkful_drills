Insertion Sort

    - one of the simplest methods of sorting

    - maintain two lists
        - first is original list
        - new list will be ordered

    - to add elements, take an element from the original list and move through the new list
        - stop and insert at the appropriate place

    - does not scale well

    - if the list is already sorted, this sort takes n steps to complete
        - will simply iterate through list

    - if list is completely out of order, could take n-squared steps



Merge sort
    - takes advantage of fact that merging two small sorted lists into one large sorted list is fast

    - starts by breaking our large list into single element sublists
        - each individual list is inherently ordered

        - merge the single element list together into pairs, read from single end to preserve order

    - worthwhile for use on long lists

    - technique is called divide and conquer
        - breaks task into smaller ones
        - sorts small lists and brings them together

    - much faster than insertion sort
    - runs recursively
