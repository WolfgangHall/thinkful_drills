what is scraping?

    - access a web page
    - locate info on web page
    - save information for later access


Access web pages
    - skip the browser
    - send a request to the web server
    - server responds with html or error code

    - may need to provide token information


Locate specific info
    - parse the response
    - html uses tags to differentiate pieces of information
    - one common html parser is Xpath

Save info somewhere
    - can be stored in various file formats
        - json, csv, sql db

    - upload from that file to work with it


Tools
    - requests (for access to web page)
    - beautifulsoup or lxml (for parsing)
    - json or pymysql (for storing)

    - scrapy (incorporates all of these things)
        - has built-in default methods to keep it from crashing
