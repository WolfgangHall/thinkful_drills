On my second day he shouted at me, telling me how stupid I was. Often he would sit next to me with his hand on my leg while we analysed data together. Once I made a mistake in my experiment and he laughed, but clapped me on the back so hard that it hurt. I was very unwell at the time and felt unable to do anything about my manager\u2019s behaviour. I didn\u2019t know where to look for support from my department as I was very isolated from other staff and I knew that other staff had seen what was happening but not taken any action. I knew I needed a good reference from him to get another job. So I left, and pretended it was due to circumstances outside work. I was unemployed for two months while I found another job in a different city. I now work at the same university again, in a different research group, but I sometimes see him, and hide. I don\u2019t know what the right thing is to do. Confront him? Report him? Hope to successfully avoid him until he retires? If he sees me, be polite? Be honest? I don\u2019t know.

We agreed as we are students and looking to make some money over the summer. on the train journey to the market, we travelled with the two bosses (both males who had graduated from university about 10 years ago) and other interns working for them. I was sitting next to my sister but could overhear the conversation going on between one of the bosses and another female intern in her second year of university. She was saying that she had an interview coming up and she wasn\u2019t sure what to wear. she was deciding between a \u2018sexier dress\u2019 and a more \u2018covered up dress\u2019 and what the boss had to say next was so shocking to me. He seemed to really be interested in the topic and surprising to me he had developed a very large opinion on the topic of what a women should wear in the workplace. He had had a lot of experience in banking and financial services prior to this and this was the exact industry this female intern was applying to. he said \u2018Firstly, when you do the interview the best thing to do is to dress more covered up just in case you have a female interviewer she won\u2019t like you if you dress sexy. But then when you get the job, you should gradually dress sexier and sexier. This will ensure that all of the men in the office notice you and they will all love you. they will all want to work with you. But if you dress \u2018boring\u2019 for the entire time no one will care about you or ever listen to what you have to say\u201d. After overhearing this I was so angry and shocked for soooooo many reasons:", "\n1)\tIt makes me sad that women have learned that they get further when they objectify themselves for men. It\u2019s like the \u2018sneeky\u2019 way that women can get ahead by manipulation, but when we do this are we really getting ahead? Or just undermining eachother, I don\u2019t know.

How  How attractive men find us?  Guess what some of us really could care less. Listen to what we have to say please.", "\n3)\t From his experience in finance he (as a guy) has learned that the only way a woman can be noticed in the work environment is by objectifying herself. Basically saying that the only way you will get listened to or paid attention to is if the guys in the office want to have sex with you. If they don\u2019t want to have sex with you, you are worthless and no one is going to listen to you. So basically here he described two options: don\u2019t get listened too because your not \u2018hot enough\u2019 or \u2018too boring\u2019 , or don\u2019t get listened to but maybe get your way because the guys are drooling over you.", "\nFrom his experience in the financial markets and after hearing about other stories from my friends, I am so sad to believe that this is actually the working environment that women have to enter.

How after working so hard, all the hours you put in to studying, all the hard work you put in to your CV, and building yourself as a person. In the end we are valued by how we look or by who wants to have sex with us. what if you couldn\u2019t care less and you actually want your voice to be heard and respected. After hearing this it makes me not want to enter these work places especially because they are so male dominated and have dominant \u2018lad\u2019 cultures.", "\nHowever, I am not going to let this deter me. We have to rise above it and be stronger. I really believe we have to be the change we wish to see in the world and one way we can do this is by having conversations with people who commonly show sexist traits. It is normal to feel angry because me like so many other women have experienced a lot of sexism and various sexual harassment and it\u2019s a frustrating thing  to have to talk about. But as I have grown up and matured I have learned to control my anger. I am now friends with a lot of guys and whenever they say something offensive or downright sexist I take a deep breath and slowly talk it through with them. I think the key is firstly not acting angry or offend because then we will both be acting defensive and this way we get nowhere. Then go back to the beginning with them, ask them questions to slowly understand the way they are thinking. I mean I believe that sexism such a key issue today, but many girls and boys are taught sexist ways because it is seen as so normal. sometimes their intentions aren\u2019t bad so you can\u2019t be angry with them personally just angry and sad that this is what society teaches them is ok. So by having these conversations with guys I have managed to slowly change their perception and help them understand what objectifying means. why it\u2019s not ok to call a girl a \u2018slut\u2019 just because she is wearing revealing clothing. because guess what sometimes as a girl it is empowering to show skin. why? because for so long in history girls have not been allowed to do this. you are labelled as cheap, slut, sleeping around, wanting sex\u2026etc. (also there is nothing wrong with a girl who sleeps around or wants sex) but sometimes its empowering to dress this way, let people think those things of you, but know for yourself that you are a well-educated and respectable young women. and guess what, sometimes its empowering to cover up. why? because there are pictures of naked girls everywhere, on the streets, in newspapers, online. they are made to look objects. and sometimes it\u2019s just empowering to keep your body for yourself because it is yours after all and whatever you choose to do with it is your choice and people should stop having so many opinions on how WE choose to show our bodies.

Both men were middle-aged, and both were married, and although I would constantly remind them of these facts, neither would stop harassing me.", "By Christmas I was feeling desperate, I wanted to quit so badly so that I would never have to see either one of those creeps again, but I couldn\u2019t find another job and I really needed the income, so I stayed in order to be able to feed and house my children.  The manager had planned an elaborate holiday party for the employees at a very expensive club/restaurant, and the seven part-time employees and I met him at the party venue.  He\u2019d evidently been there awhile and was already inebriated by the time we arrived, and as soon as he saw me he sloppily insisted that I had to dance with him.  I kept making excuses, but he wouldn\u2019t take no for an answer.  Of course as soon as I conceded and started dancing with him, he pulled me into a slow dance embrace and started touching me all over.  I couldn\u2019t conceal my revulsion, and I pushed him away as hard as I could and yelled, \u201cstop it!\u201d  He stumbled a bit backward, but quickly regained his balance and glared at me like he wanted to kill me.

I ducked to the side very quickly, so the bone and all the ensuing others that he lobbed at me never hit his intended target, but it was very humiliating at the time.  John kept trying to talk sense into the manager, and would try to intercept his arm before he could throw each bone, and he actually told the manager \u201chey man, that\u2019s not right.\u201d  But the manager would always shrug him off and continued to throw the bones at me as hard as he could.

I felt guilty for being the reason why John refuse to get out, I knew he felt he needed to stay to protect me, but I had to get home to my children and so I told John I\u2019d be okay and that he should go ahead and go into his house so he could go to bed finally.  After John asked me \u201care you sure?\u201d like a dozen times, he finally got out of the car and instructed me to call him when I got home.", "We sat in the driveway another 10 minutes because the manager kept ordering me to move to the front seat, and I kept refusing.

I did move to the front seat, but by this time my fear was turning into indignant anger\u2013finally.  The manager had to get on the interstate to take me home, and after merging on to the interstate he grabbed me by my neck and tried to violently pull me to him\u2013all while he kept insisting \u201cgive me a kiss.\u201d  I had my left arm straight out pushing against him but he kept trying to force me to kiss him.

I was so relieved that the ordeal was over that I cried before composing myself to go inside.  I knew I was probably going to be fired, but I kept hoping that he\u2019d been so drunk he might forget everything that had transpired the night before, so I went into work the next morning actually hoping I would still have that terrible, awful job.  As soon as he saw me he looked away and simply stated, \u201cYour services are no longer needed.\u201d  I turned right around and walked out, eventually got home somehow, and never did anything except look for a new job because I knew, even back then and at such a young age (22 years of age) that I could never afford a lawyer, and that he\u2019d just lie if the case ever went to trial.  I also felt that the only person who would be a witness for me was the one person I would never ask because John was a new father and could not afford to lose his job.", "But over all these many years I recognize that this sexism/sexual harassment experience only made me ever more determined, ever more angry, and it pushed me to become a person who actively tries to enable other women to more effectively deal with such situations.
