1. Popularity of various Uber drivers.
    -> Yes. A survey is the good metric for quantifying driver popularity.

2. A grocery store wants to know how much people like strawberry, chocolate, and vanilla ice cream.
    -> I feel like sales numbers will determine how much people like various ice cream flavors, although a survey is not necessarily bad.

3. Trojan wants to know whether their condoms are more popular among straight people or gay people.
    -> Surveys are good way to get information on private topics.

4. Recently, rental rates for HappyCars have increased by 30%, which is quite unusual. You want to find out why this is happening and how to keep the increase going.
    -> Surveys are a good way for positively impacted customers to share their experiences.

6. Assessing the success rate of a new advertising campaign.
    -> I feel like sales rates will determine this.

7. Measuring the effect of nurse/patient ratio on patient recovery rates in hospital wards.
    -> Probably not a useful spot for a survey.
